Counteralgotrucker,Try bromantane . It increase dopamine in situations when it is needed but should not wire you. It boosts testosterone. And last of all it it feels like a mild anti anxiolytic. I think this is due to its bromine atom.,1673032397,j38dhs6,t3_10526iu,t3_10526iu,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Here's some of the nootropics I am most interested in after looking around that are for getting the brain to function as it should. My wishlist is not complete, and I'm just making it for myself. You should examine all of these for yourself.  
Cerebrolysin - 10-5ml IV for 3 weeks, expensive.  
IDRA-21 - I'm not sure about this one's safety compared to others on this list, but it's very interesting.  
ISRIB A17 - Meant to make your brain's defense mechanisms that prevent neural growth after damage and stress not function. I think. You should research it. Expensive though.  
Centrophenoxine - Apparently reduces lipofuscin? A combination of two nootropics that work together after being broken apart in the liver.  
Lion's Mane - Out of the more natural extracts, this and baccoppa I have a sense are more for health.  
Good nutrition, Omega-3, and exercise are indispensable.   
PQQ
  
Another target you should focus on for brain health is good sleep. There are some nootropics o
to help, but this is a generally more risky zone.
Melatonin  
Magnesium Glycinate  
Glycine  
Phenibut - use sparingly or not at all  
GABA  
Lemon Balm  
  
If you’re going to stress your brain:
NAC, Emoxypine, Jiaogulan, memantine, vitamin C, Vitamin E, Sulbutiamine, Pyritinol. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/24pz9z/amphetamine_is_there_a_consensus_on_it_being/ch9o5mn?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3  

You can also take things for cerebral circulation. I'm also interested in angiogenesis. Vinpocetine, Uncaria tomentosa",1673050253,j39o658,t3_10526iu,t3_10526iu,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
