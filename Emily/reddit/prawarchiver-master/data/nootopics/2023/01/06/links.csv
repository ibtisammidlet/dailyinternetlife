After several years I found out I got several tickborn diseases and also SIBO, I was able to treat those and around almost 1.5 years years ago I started to feel much better. Since then I have slowly become better and better but I still have some symptoms mainly fatigue (especially mental), chronic irritated eyes and very sensitive to stress. These symptoms seems to be more connected to burn out (blood work shows a much lower level of inflammation than before but there is still some inflammation.) than some infection.   


I wonder what nootropics/stack you guess recommend for helping with the recovery of the years of being very sick and burned out?  


I started tianeptine two weeks ago which I am very happy with since it helps me with motivation, energy, anhedonia while making me feel more relaxed and helps me deal with stress much better.  
I am also doing a lot of meditation, working out, changing my mindsets to become more relaxed and content but would like someone that can help with more energy while at the same being anxiolytic.  


I am waiting on getting bromantane and fasoracetam seems also interesting to possible try in the future.
