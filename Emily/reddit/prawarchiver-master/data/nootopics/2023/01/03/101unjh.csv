MettaMind,"Smells like being a kid. Out in the woods hunting for treasure, fighting ghosts and pirates, morning dew evaporating off of the fallen leaves. The feeling of spring finally arriving. The dense smell of fresh soil under your fingernails. The fragrances of moss and lichen and trees permeating your nasal passages with their pungent, earthy aromas. Yeah, I get the nostalgia too when the scent washes over me each time I use Bromantane.",1672711968,j2pq7br,t3_101unjh,t3_101unjh,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
