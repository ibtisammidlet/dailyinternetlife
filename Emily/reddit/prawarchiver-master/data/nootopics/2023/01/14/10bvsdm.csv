SunDevil329,"Improvements to my overall energy and confidence levels are the most prominent effects. Positive effects on both depression and motivation.

Helps with anxiety to some extent, though the onset can be a little stimulating until you get used to it (that's with 2x sprays intranasal, one per nostril).

I usually take 3 sprays total: 2 in the morning and 1 after lunch. I cycle this 5 on, 2 off (take a break on weekends).

My biggest gripe would definitely be the oily nasal passages that inevitably result. I spray, lie down on my side for 4 minutes to keep the solution in the right place, and then repeat for the other nostril.

Seems to do a decent job of minimizing any drip, but even after cleaning my nostrils multiple times they'll still be a little oily.

SunDevil329,"Note regarding IN use: the administration takes some getting used to. Lying down if you're able makes it so much simpler.

Could just be me, but at first this may seem extreme and/or rather complicated. Truthfully, I wasn't sure it was worth it initially. The process actually becomes fairly routine with practice, so I encourage you to stick with it for a while before you get too frustrated.

Further, I had to up my morning dose to 2 sprays (1 per nostril) before I really felt the benefits. Debatable if my third dose is necessary, I may experiment with that (it's mainly to extend duration).",1673795050,j4gbewt,t3_10bvsdm,t1_j4d595v,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Update 4/14/23:

I no longer recommend cycling bromantane (5 on, 2 off), as I've been dosing continuously without any significant change in effects for at least 1 mo. Bromantane's pharmacology suggests significant tolerance or dependence is unlikely, which I've confirmed anecdotally from several individuals.

Not sure if /u/sirsadalot modified the formulation at all or if I'm just more comfortable with the IN process, but my bromantane hasn't seemed as oily lately.

I have also started lightly sniffing once my head is in position to keep the liquid in place. I find there's less chance for drip with this method, plus it seems better absorbed in general.

Lastly, I've adjusted my dose to 4 sprays every morning. Still a rather new change, but I find taking 2 sprays per nostril (in rapid succession) produces the best effects for me.",1681499268,jg9l3vx,t3_10bvsdm,t1_j4d595v,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Theoretically, I would think you could pour the liquid into a sprayer and use IN. Depending on the formulation, it may drip right out or just not be as potent. As inconvenient as it can be, the caprylic acid  is thicker and does a decent job of holding the liquid in place.

Not 100% sure but that would be my assumption. I suspect it will be considerably thinner than the Bromantane sold on everychem, which again just makes it more prone to dripping.",1673793140,j4g795y,t3_10bvsdm,t1_j4fgxdb,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

I've found if I position my head correctly, it's not necessary to hold after the first spray. I have started holding the opposite nostril (so the one I've already sprayed) when I turn over to do the other nostril (I lie on opposite sides), as it does drip a bit if I don't.
