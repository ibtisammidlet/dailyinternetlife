hintonmj,"I was on 20mg a day for a couple years for migraine and I didn't associate (no pun intended) any side effects with it. 

Sorry, that probably doesn't help. I was actually just thinking about trying it again to see if I notice a nootropic effect since I have some on hand and started seeing people talk about it for that reason.

If I recall correctly, I think it's recommended to titrate up, so perhaps try splitting a pill in half?

What are you trying to accomplish by taking it?",1673792991,j4g6y03,t3_10cj95i,t3_10cj95i,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"it’s an NMDA antagonist and anticholinergic, of course it causes brain fog!! probably one of the most infamous noots for doing so. tolerance eventually builds to this after a couple weeks, however. id recommend slowly building up to your desired dose so the side effects aren’t as debilitating. taking piracetam with a choline source, as well as potentially something like d-serine alongside the memantine may help with some of the side effects like working memory and dissociation.",1673801500,j4gr18j,t3_10cj95i,t3_10cj95i,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"A recommendation is to be consistent with the medication. What can happen is homeostasis. A balancing of the NDMA receptors in your brain. What this means is that if you miss a dose, you can become more tolerant to it. Make sure you take your dosage near the same time of day always. Otherwise don't try it. Be careful with going on and off, this is not the medication for that if you want benefits long term.",1677255935,j9u7w9y,t3_10cj95i,t3_10cj95i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
