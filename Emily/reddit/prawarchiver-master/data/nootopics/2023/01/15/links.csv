Hi

I took Memantine for the first time (10mg). It was a very unpleasant experience:

I experienced huge brain fog, huge dissociation (yes I know its a dissociative), felt very robotic and 0% functional.

To those who have more experience with it, do those side effects typically go away with chronic dosing? I would love to get some advice",False,t5_4aoxhu,First Time Memantine - Huge Brain Fog,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10cj95i/first_time_memantine_huge_brain_fog/
