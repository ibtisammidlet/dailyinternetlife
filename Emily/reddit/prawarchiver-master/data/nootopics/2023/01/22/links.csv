The only side effect of this drug class is nausea and emesis, But it's apparent with roflumilast at dose of 500 mcg, while the human studies on cognition used only 100 mcg and it was tolerable with no side effects.

Not to raise cortisol levels. Although cortisol itself does increase dopamine, your body maintains pretty tight homeostatic control over cortisol. Instead, iâ€™m suggesting using that homeostatic control mechanism itself to raise dopamine.

When you take exogenous cortisol, it causes feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. In particular, it will inhibit the release of corticotrophin releasing hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Well, CRH is actually responsible for much of the dynorphin release in the brain.

So in theory, exogenous cortisol should decrease dynorphin, which decreases activation of kappa opioid receptors, thereby disinhibiting dopamine.

Edit: It turns out the commenter who called me dumb was actually correct. I've been doing more research and it turns out that while CRH does increase dynorphin, most of the dynorphin synthesis is under the control of CREB.
