,"why not just take bromantane, which both increases dopamine and also lowers coritisol. higher levels of cortisol aren’t necessarily good for improved cognition",1674377075,j5e1ac7,t3_10i9v3c,t3_10i9v3c,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

YoungB11,"What do you mean by taking a cortisol supplement? Like, taking exogenous cortisol such as prednisone?

I know that cortisol has a bad rep, but from my experience, I only feel alive and productive when I know I have slightly elevated levels from life stressors (training, dieting...). Obviously, to a certain extent because too much of it is bad but that's how my body works ultimately.

Today I was relaxed and chill after taking a day off from training yesterday but as the day went by I felt I was missing something... My performance at work and my mood weren't there.

It wasn't up until I decided to go for a 40 min run in the afternoon that my brain was able to fire up properly. I was more productive from 3 - 7PM than from 7AM to 2PM lol",1674413419,j5fw1gn,t3_10i9v3c,t3_10i9v3c,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

DoggoChann,Cortisol is also linked to higher chances of getting a heart attack. Doesn't sound like a great idea,1674415033,j5g08mj,t3_10i9v3c,t3_10i9v3c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
blabmight,I’ve found artificially increasing cortisol through exogenous supplementation to be initially motivating and later relatively unpleasant. Nothing feels better than healthy.,1674505696,j5l9w0o,t3_10i9v3c,t3_10i9v3c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
astray488,"I am a very fast TH (Tyrosine Hydroxylase) SNP allele carrier. Bromantane, I can undoubtedly say - doesn't benefit me, having tried a few cycles.

That being said, OP's hypothesis has some ground, as we know there is a simultaneous and causative peak in dopamine and cortisol levels at the morning cycle of the circadian rhythm to 'arouse' us from slumber. So this raises another question:

What about corticosteroids (such as Cortisone)? Funny enough, I have a friend with MS who experiences mania when using nasal corticosteroids.. (his doctor pulled him off that real quick, we both been wondering why this occurs to him).",1674417766,j5g76cl,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j5e1ac7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SimilarCrew2291,Yeah but i’m not sure if it does it in a way that would lower CRH,1674359500,j5da7jw,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j5d9i2y,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
thekazooyoublew,I believe that's only in the caffeine naive. The effect mostly dissipates after continuous consumption...iirc that is.,1674398340,j5ev4ne,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j5d9i2y,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

AromaticPlant8504,Low CRH makes life so dull and boring. I’ve suppressed it with cortisol and it makes it difficult to remember things or grind at work,1674363773,j5di8tt,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j5daagg,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
astray488,I'm still uncertain what downstream effects trigger this. I speculate it's some glutaminergic or dopaminergic mechanism of action.,1675216928,j6q154v,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j6pc65j,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,True having some levels of cortisol is good for you as you’d literally would die without the hormone. But excess cortisol is also linked to numerous problems so unless you have low levels I’d be careful excessively raising cortisol levels.,1674369983,j5ds6vg,t3_10i9v3c,t1_j5di8tt,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
