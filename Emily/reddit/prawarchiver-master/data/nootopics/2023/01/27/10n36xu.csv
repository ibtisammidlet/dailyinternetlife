227_pi,"Exciting, but the half life is also important to look at ; it's hardly viable if you have to take it 10 times a day like entacapone or 3 times a day like tolcapone.  
Of concern also : the patent for it was bought 2 years ago, so after the paper you linked was published, and nothing so far indicates that research on CERC-406 will be pursued.  


Btw have you found a way to manage your fast COMT ? I'm really interested.",1684098172,jk5u2xg,t3_10n36xu,t3_10n36xu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

227_pi,"Yeah. I only function well if under controlled stress (that doesn't trigger my OCD or PTSD), for 1-2 days after exercising or after some prolonged cognitive activity... none of which I'm able to maintain, and I have so many triggers to feel worse.Fast COMT is such a liability and that's so clear when looking at studies ; people with rs4680 have 2x less pleasure from similar life events, lessened executive functions, more risks for some conditions, they exercise much more than average to slow COMT. That's just depressing.

&#x200B;

I want to check though : did you properly check that you have it ? Not only rs4680 matters, you also have to check [rs6269 and rs4633](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/14/1/135/2355796). If the rs6269 is GG, you clearly have fast COMT, otherwise you're good.   
Also, if it doesn't bother you, please provide your rs165599 and rs737865. I can explain why I'm asking that later. 

Thanks in advance \^\^",1684099867,jk5y0up,t3_10n36xu,t1_jk5w9py,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

RS4680: GG

RS6269: GG

RS4633: CC

They have some interesting suggestions for diet, lifestyle, and supplements. The main one I've found to be helpful is exercise, but I'm curious about SAM-E and St.John's Wort (SJW) as suggestions to help with this- especially because I have depression anyway and have been thinking about taking SJW as I wean off Zoloft.

I find it fascinating what you said about finding a sweet spot with stress and exercise such that you can help your fast COMT without triggering your PTSD. I've been digging into my own traumatic past and what you're describing here sounds like my path to recovery. I go through these bouts of regular exercise and then it becomes unsustainable and I burn out. Or, I just get out of rhythm and then it's very difficult for me to get back into one again.

I'm doing a lot of work in and out of therapy around all of this and am actually going to begin ketamine treatment soon. I wonder if a good two-pronged approach would be to do something like ketamine, EMDR, and the like (to address the trauma) while also implementing regular low-intensity-steady-state cardio into the mix. This could even take the form of walking- especially if you have hills around like I do.

Feel free to keep in touch and share about your journey!

Oh, and here are the rest:

From what SelfDecode is saying, these are more favorable compared to my COMT results above.",1684108945,jk6h5tz,t3_10n36xu,t1_jk5y0up,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
