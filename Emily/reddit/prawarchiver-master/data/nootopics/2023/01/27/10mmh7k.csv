ilovedoxo,Modafinil or Ephedrine would be my go to for ADHD if I run out my adderall script early,1674846650,j64xxp7,t3_10mmh7k,t3_10mmh7k,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"The Afinils (modafinil, adrafinil, etc.) are likely the closest I can think of. They're all weak dopamine reuptake inhibitors. MPH is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which this wouldn't address.

Possibly IN Bromantane with adrafinil or modafinil. May be a bit stimulating depending on dose, but I've done it with fladrafinil.

Edit: for clarification, I misunderstood the intent of the OP (I think) and gave examples of the closest nootropics in terms of MOA and/or effects. Alternatives to MPH for ADHD purposes is a bit different, and more to the question I think the OP was asking. May f/u with additional suggestions.",1674833210,j63y556,t3_10mmh7k,t3_10mmh7k,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Wrt substitutes ""that can actually do catecholamine reuptake"" and that are ""helpful for attention and focus,"" see my original reply.

These are really two separate questions; catecholamine reuptake is just one of many methods by which attention, motivation, and/or focus can be improved.

I'd recommend the following for attention/motivation/focus:

- IN Bromantane
- B Complex
- DHA (fish / algal oil)
- CDP-Choline / Alpha-GPC
- Uridine monophosphate
- L-theanine
- L-Tyrosine / NALT

I take all of the above daily except for Bromantane, which I cycle 5 days on / 2 off. The L-Tyrosine is more for the two off days and as needed.

IN Semax and/or IN Selank, as well as the more potent varieties (N-Acetyl / Amidate), are also definitely worth trying. Semax is likely better for ADHD, but thus far I've only tried Selank and NASA.

NACET or NAC may be helpful for curbing ADHD symptoms.

Short-term options (either need to be cycled and/or are subject to diminishing returns) include Noopept and racetams, Rhodiola rosea, Sulbutiamine,  Cordyceps mushroom extract, GS15-4 Panax Ginseng, Adrafinil / fladrafinil (I'd only use this if absolutely necessary due to the liver concerns).",1674844951,j64tevt,t3_10mmh7k,t3_10mmh7k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
