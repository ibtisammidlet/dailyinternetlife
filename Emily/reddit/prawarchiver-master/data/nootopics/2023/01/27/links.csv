What is the likelihood that excitotoxicity could arise from this combination? Mind you, I’m also taking Memantine for the treatment of aspergers, ocd, adhd, and depression.

I just discovered that I have excess COMT and that I may benefit from addressing this in some way. I took a look at what's currently out there in terms of COMT inhibitors (COMT-I), and it seems like what's currently on the market does not cross the blood-brain barrier too well and, instead, primarily works peripherally.

Then I discovered CERC-406.

Currently, I can't find much information on this drug, but I do know that it is a COMT-I that targets the CNS. It's in development for use as an adjunct to levodopa for Parkinson's patients, but I could see other uses as well (I think someone mentioned they're looking into whether it could improve cognitive symptoms of depression, for example).

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone knows anything about this? What are your thoughts on it? Could it be custom synthesized to gain early access to it, like Tak-653?

Any and all thoughts welcome and appreciated

Oh! and btw, this is the main area in which there actually is some free info online about CERC-406: [https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa\_presentations/567/45567/original.pdf](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/567/45567/original.pdf)",False,t5_4aoxhu,CERC-406 COMT Inhibitor,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10n36xu/cerc406_comt_inhibitor/

 Is there anything you've proven that can actually do catecholamine reuptake like methylphenidate does, and was it helpful for attention and focus?
