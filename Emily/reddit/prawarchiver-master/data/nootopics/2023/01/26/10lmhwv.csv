ryderlefeg,I combined Bromantane with MAOIs just fine.,1674720285,j5xs0j5,t3_10lmhwv,t3_10lmhwv,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
MezDez,It's fine. MAOI risk is overblown. I have taken mdma on parnate without a single issue.. it is amazing what happens when you understand pharmacology rather than blanket statements pushed by liable doctors.,1674778341,j619mep,t3_10lmhwv,t3_10lmhwv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
anton952,"You really should do more research before taking drugs. At the very least:

- Sirsadalot's guide
- works of J.Knoll on selegiline
- Selegiline\rasagiline - distant cousins
- scheme of selegiline metabolism, effects of desmethylselegiline, l-meth vs d-meth, l-amph vs d-amph

After you're done, think about this: there is a hypothesis that there is aberrant tonic gaba activity in parkinson's. After half a year selegiline stops helping with that. Then patients have to be put on l-dopa. If this kind of tolerance takes 6 months to form, how much time after quitting mao-b inhibitors it will take to recover? Reversible mao-b inhibitors don't cause that kind of tolerance, btw.

If you're planning to take selegiline in low dose then there is another caveat: it will boost phasic release of catecholamines x2. Not tonic!! Young age = high phasic release = impulsivity and curiosity = heightened suicide rates. You're going to add to that. Selegiline is good for older people, who lack impulsivity (it declines with age). On selegiline they get a bit of child-like qualities back. Also, adhders are low on tonic dopamine, impulsive, and have high rates of suicide.

Superhorse999,"Have tried all those combos and works fine/did not die. I generally take tyrosine with bromantane as there's simple logic in the flow there although I would caution that I believe high tyrosine levels are an anxiety driver for some people.

I know sellegeline is sexy right now but really safinamide should technically be a better choice imo. All the same, it's not magic juice with or without bromantane so realistic expectations is key in my view.",1674723889,j5xwewz,t3_10lmhwv,t3_10lmhwv,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

MezDez,"I inject my MDMA (subq) to lower the gastric side effects.

Generally 5-10mg parnate. It does build up if you take it everyday.

MDMA maybe no more than 30-50mg..

Without parnate, I generally take 120mg via subq.

Moclobemide is much safer because it is reversible and will unbind from the MAO if serotonin concentration in the synapses exceed a specific concentration..",1674784081,j61ml5j,t3_10lmhwv,t1_j61ls1k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Superhorse999,It's more selective and reversible. It is described as a generation ahead of the other two generally albeit for our purposes one might not find it to be an enormous leap but there does appear to be evidence that it's a better choice.,1674724467,j5xx3km,t3_10lmhwv,t1_j5xwr2e,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
