From my understanding, so supposedly it's supposed to block nmda receptors but isn't that going to affect your long-term memory poorly? (Also anyone know the effects it gives compared with something like cerebrolysin the peptide..)

&#x200B;

It seems like it has a pretty good safety profile, so are there anything to be cautious about when taking other nootropics or supplements while on TAK -653? ( just want to be cautious for my rat ðŸ˜‰)

Would very much love to hear your experience with this compound?
