TAK-653, an AMPA receptor potentiator with minimal agonistic activity, produces an antidepressant-like effect with a favorable safety profile in rats

&#x200B;

It's not antagonist, not even agonist. The creators call it AMPA receptor potentiator or positive allosteric modulator. It's stimulant like compound and potent antidepressant. What is special about it is that unlike it predecessor TAK-137 it seems to be more safe because PAMs are notorious for causing seizures .",1672886455,j2zymn2,t3_102rkft,t3_102rkft,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,"I've been on it for a few months. It's a very solid nootropic. It's primary MOA of importance is that is the most selective AMPA PAM available. The original trials were done at 6mgs and the suggested dose on Everychem is 2mgs which I think is much more reasonable. Most people seem to like it at a range of 1.5mg, for slight cognitive enhancement and elevated mood, up to 3-4mgs where it is more likely to boost your IQ but can start to have a slight dissociative effect for some. I have been taking personally at about 1-2mgs per day and have had no side effects at all. My mind feels generally more active and energized but in a focused way. It also has a nice mood boost as well. I think the owner of everychem really nailed this one and I believe there are already others trying to synth it but at much higher prices. It also seems to have no negative interactions that I can tell although some people claim it pairs poorly with THC.",1672858439,j2xxzo1,t3_102rkft,t3_102rkft,11,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"I have not, though I'm somewhat interested. I had been considering oral/sublingual dosing, but there's a lot of hysteria regarding anhedonia.

While that *may* be more of a concern with oral dosing vs. IM (?), it's troubling nonetheless. I'm not currently too keen on inj, as I've no reason to believe it'll actually help.

Frankly, I've done what I can do. I just have to face the reality that this is how it'll always be. At this point, I think I'm better off focusing on mental health and pain management.",1688421095,jqk52pl,t3_102rkft,t1_jqk2fat,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,Cortexin needs to be reconstituted but its super easy. You just pour bac water or saline directly into the amp and then pour that into the sprayer. One extra step that you don't have to do with cere basically. I just think cortexin is a generally more potent version of the same drug. It feels noticeably anxiolytic and is like a general system upgrade overall. Both are great so I wouldn't worry about it too much. I believe that cortexin is also cheaper if I'm not mistaken also.,1672944267,j3328gl,t3_102rkft,t1_j32vghe,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,I've never done injections but I know many who have trie both. Most agree that IN is more potent and way more cost effective. I don't of any safety issues with cortexin. There have been reports online of people injecting bad batches of cere and it making them feel kind of sick. I've never had this issue. I cycle both cere and cortexin into my stack intermittently and at least for me always IN. I'm going to put up a tutorial for doing these peptides IN in the coming days.
