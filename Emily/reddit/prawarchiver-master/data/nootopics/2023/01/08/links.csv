wanted to buy some fishoil caps. I can choose between two from a brand i trust. Both have 500mg of fishoil. Number one has 18% EPA and 12% DHA. The other has 10% EPA and 50% DHA and is more expensive (20€ vs 35€). The first one also has 10mg vit E per cap.
Which would you recommend?",False,t5_4aoxhu,fishoil EPA/DHA ratio,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/106esej/fishoil_epadha_ratio/
