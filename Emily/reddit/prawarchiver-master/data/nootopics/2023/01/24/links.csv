An anecdote of Lion's Mane/ Reishi/ Cordyceps triggering manic episodes. Donepezil worsening my lows as well. 

For phenotype reference: Just 10 days ago, I had a random laughing fit for about 5 minutes while staring at the ceiling. I was sober and quite literally doing nothing but forcing myself to fall asleep. I've only taken notice to emotional fluctuation the past few months. Throughout my life I've had stages where I come out my room to communicate and can't stop laughing when talking. I literally have to act like I just thought of something funny to play it off.

A few days after that I started using 2.5 mg of Donepezil a day and continued previous experimenting microdosing atomoxetine + dopaminergics. (In an attempt to improve focus) I then suffered from an intense bout of depression only 4 days in. It was one of the saddest, most anxious, things I've ever experienced. It was almost like a panic attack yet depressive. I quit, obviously. Today, I took a Lions Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps supplement. The past 12 hours I've been attempting to study, having extremely vivid narcissistic-like imaginations, and went on a pharmaceutical shopping spree. Within a few days I went from wondering if I should even exist to wondering how I get to be the soul inside an individual with so many gifts. I feel a comedown right now. My feats at 21 are impressive but I constantly compare myself to the best of my age during fits of low self-esteem which obliterates my ego. 

I'm undiagnosed anything. Completely sober while posting this aside from 400 mg of Piracetam earlier + said supplement.

How do I go about explaining any of this to a doctor without being put in a straight jacket?

Am I bipolar?

Apologies for using this sub to post my anecdote. I just value this sub because of the obvious number of competent individuals who participate.

On a side note: The mushroom combo acted extremely synergistically. Highly recommend",False,t5_4aoxhu,Reishi/LM/Cordyceps Trigger Manic Episodes? Donepezil worsening depression? Chemical induced BP?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10k5fwu/reishilmcordyceps_trigger_manic_episodes/
