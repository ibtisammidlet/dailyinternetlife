Fusion_Health,"Beet juice powder for enhanced NOS (takes about 30-45 mins kick in but very long lasting)

BCAAs during will help keep serotonin low, which will keep energy levels up 

Preloading colostrum for 1-2 weeks will help offset the increased it gut permeability from the intense activity

Could look into cardarine and nooglutyl if you wanna get a bit more high tech

Adaptogens - rhodiola, cordyceps, ginseng, wouldn’t do ashwagandha as it might lower cortisol too much

Exogenous ketones! Take them for a week or two prior cuz they WILL give you the shits if you aren’t used to them. I sip them throughout races, great steady supply of energy and should be used in conjunction with carbs (only for race day)",1674655217,j5tkwdf,t3_10kx8vm,t3_10kx8vm,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

,Cardarine (GW-501516) gives me pretty much endless endurance and energy and I can keep going until my muscles give out. It makes the liver use fatty acids for energy rather than glucose. Eat a lot of protein in the days leading up to the event and after.,1674699361,j5wpyqf,t3_10kx8vm,t3_10kx8vm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
snAp5,I’d say methylene blue > beet juice and any other NOS increasing supplement. NOS is additional oxidative stress.,1676695908,j902d0j,t3_10kx8vm,t3_10kx8vm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
