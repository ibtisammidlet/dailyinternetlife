The thing is that I don't know why, but I'm always VERY productive and focused the next day after taking 10mg of Diazepam (Valium) at night. I don't know what's the reason behind it and why hammering my GABA receptors plays a role in this effect.

I always thought that Dopamine/Epinephrine were the main drivers of focus and motivation, and indeed they are (I respond very well to stimulants) but there is something about the afterglow of this drug that makes me push, and actually want to go through tasks and things that I've been putting off for a while without any effort or friction and I actually come up with new ideas and ways to resolve complex issues that I face frequently which blows my mind, knowing that this drug is nasty and if anything, it should make dumb with frequent use but it doesn't seem to be the case when used acutely.

Knowing this, I tried to leverage the GABA system using other supplements (L-Theanine, Taurine, Magnesium, Beta Alanine, plain GABA, Chamomile tea...) but none of them comes even close to replicating this in particular. In fact, many tend to make me sleepy and unmotivated sometimes.

I used Phenibut in the past, but this is a no go for now. It doesn't replicate the same effect and nowadays, the afterglow/rebound I get from it on the 2nd day makes me deeply depressed to the point where is not worth it and I haven't used it for months now. I never abused it (only once a week)

Anyway, do you have any insight about what's going on here? What other neural pathways do benzodiazepines work on that I'm not aware of? Maybe I have some background anxiety and I'm not even aware of it, or maybe is that I get a better night's rest after using it (although, they've been proven to destroy your sleep quality)

I would like to replicate this effect or at least know more about how my neurochemistry in particular works to take advantage of it using other things because taking benzos is not sustainable at all. I know these things can destroy your life and I use it like once a month or every 2 weeks (even that is pushing it I think).",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why am I so productive the next day after taking Valium?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10o52an/why_am_i_so_productive_the_next_day_after_taking/

I've been taking both Polygala tenuifolia 20:1 extract 100mg and Emoxypine Succinate 125-250mg 3x daily for chronic stress and anxiety.

With Emoxypine, I usually dose 250 morning / 125 afternoon / 125 early evening. Occasionally, I'll take another 125 mg during the day depending on stress/anxiety levels.

Started taking both around mid/late November of last year, so getting pretty close to 3 months of continuous use.

I've experienced no desire to increase dosage of either substance and have actually done my best to limit Emoxypine. Likewise, I've noticed no indication of tolerance.

I'm probably being overly cautious, but one can never be too careful when it comes to anxiolytics.

Appreciate any advice / insight on whether and/or how these two substances should be cycled.


Update on 2/25/23:

Over the past week, I've decreased daily emoxypine dosage to 125 mg 3x daily and cycled polygala out completely on weekdays. No specific adverse effects evident.

Instead, I've been using 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF (aka eutropoflavin) 10mg once in the morning on weekdays. Both Polygala tenuifolia and 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF are TrkB agonists, and I've decided to cycle these per the advice of another reddit post I use as a resource (link below).
