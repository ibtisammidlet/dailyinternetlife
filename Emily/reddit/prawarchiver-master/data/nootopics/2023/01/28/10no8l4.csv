sanpedro12,How would you describe the effects of emoxypine. And do you notice its effect right away or does it need to build up?,1675019560,j6eaptt,t3_10no8l4,t3_10no8l4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Emoxypine seems to mellow me out quite nicely without causing any sedation. I don't notice any acute effects after taking it; more something I notice if I don't take it or adjust the dosage.

I also find that I tend to be less anxious overall, and I don't get as easily frustrated and/or stressed out by things that would otherwise bother me. I definitely still get stressed and frustrated, depending on what's going on, of course, but ability to cope is a bit better.

From what I can tell, it also tames some of my more impulsive behaviors. I'm better able to just ""be,"" without spiraling out. Again, not perfect but it seems to help.

I *think* I may be using less nicotine gum (mostly a psychological dependence) and I definitely seem to be more at ease in general.",1675021875,j6egk0d,t3_10no8l4,t1_j6eaptt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
