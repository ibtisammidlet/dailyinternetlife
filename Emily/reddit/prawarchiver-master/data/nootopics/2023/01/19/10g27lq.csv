sirsadalot,"The things you're claiming here seem more on par with psychedelics than TAK, and you're the first user I've seen claim emotional sensitizing or dread. It's also worth noting the clinical trials thus far didn't report any volatility in patients.

So I'd agree with something you said earlier, about just becoming more in tune with the reality of your situation, since TAK is the strongest nootropic to date in terms of increasing intelligence and introspection.",1674151169,j515rcq,t3_10g27lq,t3_10g27lq,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"Thanks for this post. Sounds like you’re living through challenging times. I, too, suffered with anhedonia after using Ash, and it was awful. 

I haven’t experienced anything like this with TAK (I just stopped after weeks for a break). I don’t know much about the involvement of AMPA receptors in emotions, but I’ll keep an eye on this in case others posts similar experiences.",1674140672,j50dovo,t3_10g27lq,t3_10g27lq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sonnsonn,I have experienced a similar phenomenon of increased response to any stressor when I was on a high dosage of testosterone. Road rage made me feel very alive lol,1674229227,j55kuc8,t3_10g27lq,t3_10g27lq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sospian,"I’m pretty experienced with psychedelics but always found the externalisation of trapped emotion to improve sensitivity, rather than the trip itself. 

What I’m bringing particular attention to is that I have been able to experience the emotions at their fullest. Usually I would feel it slightly and then it just holds back automatically, but since TAK these feelings have been as sharp as they’ve ever been.

Given my history, one could argue that my case is unique, given the amount of substances I’ve put in my body. However it would be interesting to see what would happen in someone of a similar case.",1674168918,j52hv7l,t3_10g27lq,t1_j515rcq,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sospian,"I'm in a pretty good position. While running a business is always stressful, stress is part of the package of life. I have a lot of knowledge & experience that can help change lives because I've been at the very bottom and that was the biggest challenge. This is a little bonus which is nice. 

>I don’t know much about the involvement of AMPA receptors in emotions

My guess would be potential influence on dopamine.",1674141528,j50ftln,t3_10g27lq,t1_j50dovo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sospian,The combo of short-term cortisol & high T can be a powerful one. The sharpened feeling of emotion from TAK made me feel very dangerous,1674230495,j55o6ut,t3_10g27lq,t1_j55kuc8,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
