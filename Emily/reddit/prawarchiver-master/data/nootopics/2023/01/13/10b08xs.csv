Switch_23,"Cerebrolysine looses it's effects quite quickly. It really needs to be used as soon as you open up the vial. The peptides are very sensitive to degradation. 

Cortexin is less sensitive but still looses it's effectiveness rather quickly. I've tried both only IM, but the loss in potency was very noticeable. Open a 5mg vial ob cere, put it in a syringe and pin it 5 days later. You'll see what I'm talking about.

You might not notice this with nasal application that much, as you aren't getting that much cere in your system anyway. But comparing a freshly opened vial applied im vs a previously opened vial is a big difference.

That being said, I will try what you're proposing here as I have both at hand. I've never tried neither IN.

I don't know exactly how permeable the nasal cavity is, but it's somewhere around 500 - 1000 daltons, is not? A quick search on bdnf and other peptides says they are around 15000 daltons in size, which would make them completely useless for IN application.

I would love to be wrong about any of this though, as being able to use cere over a prolonged period of time would be a dream.",1674135204,j501apf,t3_10b08xs,t3_10b08xs,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Re: Cortexin

""[T]hen simply pour saline/bac water into the amp. The powder will reconstitute without any mixing. A reminder that the amp itself is 5ml, so you will simply fill the amp with the saline/bac water; no need to measure it.""

This may be obvious, but do you just use good judgment on filling up the amp or is there a good "" stopping point?""

Any particular saline you recommend? Would isopropyl alcohol (70% or 98%) work instead of rubbing alcohol for cleaning the sprayer? 

Do you then just pour the reconstituted Cortexin into the sprayer? How tricky is that?
