Pure_Nourishment,"I'm not sure but I get similar effects with bromantane. It's interesting and I can only handle low dosages, which is the only reason why I haven't gone with the nasal spray option (you can't really control dose too well with it).  


I'd be interested to hear others thoughts on it!",1673565171,j43om4p,t3_10ac3nv,t3_10ac3nv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Birdy1979,What is a low dose that boosts dopaminergic effect ? Is it less than 30 mg ? Thanks,1673617766,j46axp2,t3_10ac3nv,t3_10ac3nv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Komputer_One,"It's rather interesting to see that many people react differently to many compounds. For myself, 2-4 sprays does not provide any benefits to me. Perhaps I don't notice it. However 6-8 sprays bromantane benefits me.",1674191691,j53vqe6,t3_10ac3nv,t3_10ac3nv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
KolobConquerer,"Yes, kinda like a sleepy drunk that I get with alcohol except not the incapacitation. It’s just weird how I get this with even one spray.",1673627402,j46yu15,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j446xpz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

KolobConquerer,"Well with the nasal spray a low dose for me would be one spray. You can’t really do less than that intranasaly with it, unless you snort the powdered version.",1673627448,j46yyj6,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j46axp2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"The inhibitory effects just get stronger. Note that I'm also on Zoloft though, so it could be too much serotonergic activity going on.  


Unfortunately I end up getting brain fog and that's precisely what I'm trying to treat lol  


Low dosages help if I have a goal to work toward- and it helps for more of the physical goals or demands than those that are mental, in my experience.",1673566750,j43sje4,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j43s21a,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,\~12.5mg sublingual liquid bromantane. I haven't been using it lately. I may as I get back in the gym more though.,1673623703,j46p4tl,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j46bwc0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

KolobConquerer,Sort of off-topic but how does Zoloft make you feel as far as pleasure/ emotional state?,1673569523,j43zarq,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j43sje4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

KolobConquerer,"You may be right. However, it’s speculated that intranasally is actually 4 times the bioavailability compared to taken orally. It’s additionally speculated to have a 60x longer half life than when taken orally.",1673638785,j47twhb,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j47qo6j,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"Difficult to say. When I started it, I really needed it. I had just moved to a new state and immediately took on many responsibilities. I was overwhelmed and couldn't even think straight.

Thus, in decreasing my anxiety, it allowed me to experience some semblance of pleasure and become a bit more balanced.

However, now it's been 6 months or so that I've been on it. I actually just began to lower my dose 4 days ago because I was feeling too numb. I suffer from an anhedonic/apathetic type of depression in the first place, so more numbness and lack of motivation is not ideal.

I'm not sure which direction I'll go in next. I tried Tak 653 and tropisetron without good effect (for me personally- although TAK may deserve another trial).  


Now I'm leaning toward adding Nortiptyline to the lowered Zoloft dose or coming off it completely and either trying a reversible or irreversible MAOI (e.g. Moclobemide, Pirazidol, Parnate, Nardil).

Birdy1979,"How can intranasal possibly have 60x longer half life than orally?.  That means it’s half life is a few days, yet the onset is immediate. Grateful if you can advise .thank you",1673758725,j4et8qi,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j47twhb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
KolobConquerer,"Yeah man, I haven’t heard many good things about SSRI’s. I would try any MAOi any day over an SSRI",1673627615,j46zedg,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j441nws,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"I really would like to try a reversible MAOI, but none are available in the US- which pisses me off. I could buy some over the counter and have it imported, but I would obviously like to avoid paying if I could avoid it. With that being the case, I may go out and try to find a doctor to prescribe an irreversible one- but that in itself is a challenge as well :/

Anywho, since we have similar symptoms, lemme know if anything works for ya. I'm gonna try this Paraxanthine coffee soon as well (delete or message me if links are not allowed): https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rarebird/rarebird-coffee?ref=nav\_search&result=project&term=Rarebird",1673628406,j471juw,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j46zedg,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
KolobConquerer,Yeah I asked my psych about trying an MAOi and he said it would be his last resort... I don’t understand why it’s such a difficult type of medication to be prescribed nowadays unless you have parkinsons lol,1673629733,j4756ve,t3_10ac3nv,t1_j471juw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
