\*I agree with you that Tak is probably a more predictable compound than NSI. There seems to be a wide array of responses to it. For me NSI creates a kind of dreamy, semi-blissful and creative mind state. It reduces inner self talk as well making me less distracted. I have done two 30 day cycles of it now and the effects have defiintely lingered on aftwards. It also promotes hippocampal growth. There is now evidence that alzheimers and demetia are partial caused or aggravated by hippocampal atrophy. That said there are also people who had negative reactions to NSI so I am always hesitant to suggest it as a first line protocol but for me it's been great.",1673648982,j48kyf9,t3_10aymr7,t1_j4830ze,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
