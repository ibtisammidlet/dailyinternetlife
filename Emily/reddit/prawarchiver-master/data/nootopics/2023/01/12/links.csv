I've listed the most important first and the ancillary after. I would add that my personal approach to nootropics is that the substance can't be addictive or create dependency and my preference is for substances that have a more subtle, sustainable long term effect when used in concert with other compounds rather than intense, acute effects that either wear off or cause some kind of rebound effect.

1. Intranasal Cortexin-
2. Intranasal Bromantane
3. Intranasal Insulin
4. Tak 653(low dose)
5. Tropisetron
6. CDP-Choline
7. Alcar
8. Magtein
9. Carnosic Acid(or rosemary extract w/carnosic)
10. DHA
11. Lithium Orotate
12. Agmatine Sulfate
13. NSI 189(used intermittently in cycles)

Secondary substances that I either cycle or use intermittently:

Ceylon Cinnamon, Cistanche, Nascent Iodine, Monolaurin, Intranasal Fasoracetam, Phenylpiracetem, Aniracetam(only use racetams on occasion when I have something deliverable at work etc) Boron, Liposomal Vitamin C, Liposomal Melatonin, Picamilon(rarely), Cerebrolysin(redundant with cortexin but I still use it occasionaly) Black Seed Oil, Shilajit, Jiaogulan.Betaine HCL, White Willow Bark

&#x200B;

Substances shortlisted that I may try: Pinealon, Intranasal B vitamins, Neboglamine. SKQ1, PQQ

The stack above took me a few years to sort out but has been a complete gamechanger for me in a multitude of ways.",False,t5_4aoxhu,The most effective stack I've found,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10aymr7/the_most_effective_stack_ive_found/

For some reason Bromantane feels way more inhibiting than sensitizing for me for some reason. I’ve tried low to higher dosages on the nasal spray but I only feel it’s GABAergic effects. Any clue or ideas what’s going on here?

Also if it helps, I basically can’t get addicted to pretty much anything. It also happens that caffeine and nicotine seem to only sensitize my brain. Caffeine being more helpful for the motivational anhedonia and nicotine for the consummatory anhedonia.",False,t5_4aoxhu,How can Bromantane be so inhibitory for some?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10ac3nv/how_can_bromantane_be_so_inhibitory_for_some/
