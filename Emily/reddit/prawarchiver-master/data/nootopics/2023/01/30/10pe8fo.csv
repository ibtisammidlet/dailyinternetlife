BDNFan,I've taken L-theanine (AMPA antagonist) before bed to counteract the long duration of TAK. I find it helps increase deep sleep,1675121228,j6kgejd,t3_10pe8fo,t3_10pe8fo,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

ozonep2,"I'm taking them  daily since January 10th, for exam prep.

TAK-653 in the morning, PRL-8-53 in the evening before study session.

Haven't experienced side effects you mentioned, but I do have one side effect from PRL.

Approx 2.5-3 hours after dosing (usually 8-10mg) my head start feeling heavy and it's very hard to continue studying, unless I re-dose.

That's why I only try taking it in the evening for short study sessions. 

Once I'm done with the exam - I'm definitely dropping PRL from my stack.

Very weird substance.",1675115704,j6k2dwu,t3_10pe8fo,t3_10pe8fo,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,"This perfectly describes micro haemorrhage caused by microvein burst. Was pain very sharp and localized. Did you experience feeling of pressure in the head, ringing in the ears or tangling sansation or coldness in extremities before the main event ?",1675414508,j713ypu,t3_10pe8fo,t3_10pe8fo,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jalex1984,"I have been using TAK-653 for approximately 25 days now.  I have greatly enjoyed the calming and clarifying mental effects of it.  However, in the past week I have experiencing numbness in my arms and feet at the end of the day while laying down.  I also experienced Vertigo last week for the first time.   Having said that,  I can’t be sure if it was the TAK-653.  My energy has changed since using it.  my exercise capacity has lowered.  I may stop taking this for awhile and then retry another 25 days..",1676730407,j91ed7m,t3_10pe8fo,t3_10pe8fo,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"I'm taking both at the same time in the morning, so it is perhaps the mixing together that is causing me to feel this way. I will try the exact dosage tomorrow morning to see if it happens again. If it does, I will probably switch to TAK-653 in the morning and PRL-8-53 in the evening. 

Thanks for your answer.",1675116229,j6k3sfn,t3_10pe8fo,t1_j6k2dwu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
HazyPandaMountain,Perhaps take PRL-8-53 with a choline supplement such as Alpha GPC? I believe PRL-8-53 utilizes similar cholinergic receptors pathways like racetam does which choline levels can be depleted throughout that process. Low choline settings can cause headaches or potentially severe headaches like cluster headaches.,1675140334,j6lm7en,t3_10pe8fo,t1_j6k2dwu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Jalex1984,"I’m doing fine.  I stopped using the TAk-653 as I noticed a consistent downside.  The calming effect was offset by some intense anger/moodiness after using it consistently for a few months.  Even with a very low dosage, the mood shift remained.  I still have some left but haven’t used it for months.",1691546780,jvdyq8p,t3_10pe8fo,t1_jq0ozuo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
reddit-dg,"In the meantime I have experienced the exact same thing, related to the anger and moodiness. I cannot take it for days in a row anymore. I am now doing it every 3 days and I am feeling better now but less pronounced effects.",1691575940,jvf8i5i,t3_10pe8fo,t1_jvdyq8p,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
