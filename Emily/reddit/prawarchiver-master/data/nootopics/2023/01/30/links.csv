I have a couple of questions about taking TAK-653 and PRL-8-53 together. I'm a 24-year-old male college student. Today is my second day taking TAK-653 and PRL-8-53 on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee (80mg of caffeine). I take 2mg (0.5mL) of TAK-653 and 5mg (0.5mL) of PRL-8-53. 

Yesterday, I did not feel any side effects besides having a horrible taste in my mouth when I first tried them. But that went away once I had something to eat. Throughout the day, I became quite productive at school and had a positive effect on my mood (I was feeling pretty happy and laughed a lot). I was even able to remain calm and de-escalate a situation I had with my girlfriend yesterday night. Not much drama occurred this time lol

However, today I've noticed something else is happening. I remember reading a post in this community about having vivid dreams with TAK-653, and indeed, it is true! The thing is that I had more than one dream, and I kept waking up and falling back to sleep. I'm certainly not a fan of that. Also, 1 hour after taking both solutions today, I started to feel numbness in my head and my hands for about 10 minutes. I touched my forehead and felt hot as if I had a fever.

The numbness and the ""fever"" have passed, and now I just feel my head pulsating a bit. I'm unsure if it is because I did not eat anything until now. But on the other hand, I feel quite active and happy, just a little worried about what happened. My productivity has not been tested today, but hopefully, it is as good as yesterday.  So, I was wondering if any of these ""side effects"" have happened to any of you or if I should be aware of any others. And I would also like to know if I'm taking this the right way.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"TAK-653 with PRL-8-53 (Dosage, Side Effects, Experiences)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10pe8fo/tak653_with_prl853_dosage_side_effects_experiences/
