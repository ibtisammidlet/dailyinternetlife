After much research and reading I’ve decided to go with umbrella labs. But before I pull the trigger I just wanted some more recent experiences from people who have used them and they’re products.

This stuff isn’t cheap, and I’ve spent the last week researching venders, and every single one of them has a mix of good, bad, and STAW AWAY reviews. So I’ve realized I’m not gonna find a bender without all of those, and umbrella seems to have the most minimal of the later two.

So really I’m just ready to pull the trigger, but I would just feel better if I had heard some people recent experiences in a new thread.

If it helps, I’m planning on ordering Pheynlpiracetam Hydrazide, 9-ME-BC, Bromantane, and Adrafinil.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Umbrella Labs Experiences,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10largn/umbrella_labs_experiences/
