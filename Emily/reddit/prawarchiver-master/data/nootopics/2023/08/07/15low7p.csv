ok-yess123,"Glycine strongly upregulates 5-alpha reductase.
Most of the proceeding hormones have AI properties.

If u ask me “high DHT & low E2” vs “low DHT & high E2” I’d choose that latter as low E2 is hell

But low DHT is extremely bad as well
And, more than low DHT, low AlloPreg is mentally ruining as well
AlloPreg becomes insanely low during social isolation & low AlloPreg is supposed to be the reason for post partum depression, to get an idea how bad low AlloPreg is (post finasteride syndrome is a tell of induced 5-ar downregulation and subsequent low AlloPreg)

So enough E2 is non-negotiable
AlloPreg is non-negotiable
DHT is non-negotiable unless u’re a fedora wearing nu male

Glycine shouldn’t drive e2 that low.

harry_lawson,"Haha, I haven't played that card at all I think you're projecting a bit here. 

>I meant “do the job” as in activate the receptors instead of the endogenous estrogens, which could or could not effect serum levels

Where is your source for this? I wish to hell I got all the beneficial effects of oestrogen just by drinking my tap water, but that's just not how it is. Xenooestrogens are weak af and their effect is negligible. Thus, I have to worry about my bone mineral density.

Put it this way: trestolone doesn't aromatise to E2, but does aromatise to 7 alpha methyl E2. This is a synthetic oestrogen and has similar action on the E2 receptor. Despite this, as previously mentioned, studies examining trestolone as a hormonal birth control reported decreased bone mineral density as a side effect. What does this tell us? It tells us that even though 7 alpha methyl E2 is produced in non-insignificant quantities, it cannot replace natural E2.

The advice is: keep E2 as high as tolerable. Oestrogen is nootropic and has beneficial effects on the body and brain.",1691525548,jvci9o2,t3_15low7p,t1_jvcgtcy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
harry_lawson,"I feel great. Trestolone usually improves mood and libido for most people, but due to the lack of DHT (Trestolone does not reduce to DHT) it can cause sexual dysfunction. I've been on finasteride and was fine, so I think it's a case of if you can tolerate low DHT or not. 

Plenty of bad sides to hormonal BC though, and of course having to stick myself with a needle every day isn't so fun.",1691559329,jvemjax,t3_15low7p,t1_jvcwzvh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
