I also like that for me it almost eliminates social anxiety usually it’s not in me to start conversation with others however on this I am asking questions and continuing conversation and actually being the one to start it and overall being more in touch. The only time I really experience anxiety on it is taking caffeine too close to dosing. However when a fight or flight situation happens it is 10x the usual response to the point where I cannot think from the body load in the moment and end up just defusing as quickly as possible out of fear of emotional outbreak which leads to beating yourself up later on because the right words and actions could not come out at the time to better handle the situation and stick up for yourself. 

I have also just learned the most significant increase of volume from nsi is in the right amygdala which sounds the least beneficial. “The right hemisphere of the amygdala is associated with negative emotion. It plays a role in the expression of fear and in the processing of fear-inducing stimuli.” 

Is there a way to counteract this while still gaining the other benefits and will it go back to normal afterwards? if so how soon? I was honestly in it for hippocampus growth for possible emotional trauma but it seems it does not really “grow” it the way that everyone makes it seem. It increases in volume but not nearly as much as the right hemisphere amygdala. 

Another thing I do not like about it is the noticeable increase in adhd symptoms. Having a hard time focusing my thoughts and easily getting lost in my phone as well as poor short term memory. Zoning out while trying to learn or focus on something. Learning in general now seems like a chore and I would rather listen to and watch entertainment like podcasts and such on YouTube which is not what I prefer but I guess that is the heightened emotional side to it.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Does the heightened fight or flight go away after stopping NSI-189?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15lakxz/does_the_heightened_fight_or_flight_go_away_after/
