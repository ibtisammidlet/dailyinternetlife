verysatisfiedredditr,"I was about to buy some but this would be my exact situation w/ cptsd

From what ive read when the amygdala or hippocampus grows its at the expense of the other, the other actually shrinks.  

Did you figure out a way to make the NSI189 work?",1699577326,k8ky64h,t3_15lakxz,t3_15lakxz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

dylan_0001,"The heightened fight or flight responses did go away eventually and I’m sure you would be fine if you do not get into any situations that trigger it. it kept happening to me because of what my environment was at the time. Other than that I felt it was good and helped with other things. I don’t think I would risk it with ptsd though, did you look into neboglamine?",1699592531,k8lwd0s,t3_15lakxz,t1_k8ky64h,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Whatever_acc,"That's hard to say now because I took it years ago. I'd say acute effects last for day or two and post acute, longer.",1691479198,jv9r925,t3_15lakxz,t1_jv9r5vb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
verysatisfiedredditr,"Yea im hypersensitive with people, luckily i live alone and rural now.  Its become unbearable, just a huge misanthrope now.  Have issues with intrusive rumination about past negativity from other people, really gets old.   
 I need to try nebo again, i was in a bad living situation last time, crazy roommate.

Probably need to stop self medicating and go to a therapist at this point, really only a few things left to try anyway like cerebrolysin, nsi189",1699593087,k8lxd24,t3_15lakxz,t1_k8lwd0s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,"I can relate to that for sure. It’s worth a shot then I guess to run a cycle of it but don’t expect too much out of it for me it made things a little more vivid socially and I was actually initiating conversation when I am always quiet but also kind of switched my brain from not wanting to learn things and consume entertainment instead which also went away over time. I guess due to the heightened emotional aspect of it. I am pretty emotionally flat though and it did not make me not have control over my emotions in situations like other people report, only the fight or flight really affected me. I also had a slightly better time pairing it with lions mane.

Have you had any luck with any racetams? Honestly psilocybin microdosing would be the best option but it’s not as easy as ordering it online like all of this stuff is.",1699608848,k8mjovq,t3_15lakxz,t1_k8lxd24,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
