This is due to the breakdown of Carnitine, Betaine, and Choline into Trimethylamine (TMA) by various gut microbes, which is then excreted in sweat. TMA has a strong smell of rotten fish.

The only way for the body to get rid of TMA in a reasonable amount of time is to convert it to Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an odorless molecule. This conversion is carried out by the enzyme FMO3, which is found in the liver. Some people may have genetic mutations in this enzyme that reduce its activity, and thus might get fishy odor from even low doses of Carnitine or Choline - if TMA isn't broken down to TMAO quickly enough, TMA will build up in the blood and lead to a foul body odor.

FMO3 requires Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) to work. In some cases, even without B2 deficiency, extra B2 might further increase FMO3 activity in people with genetic defects in this enzyme, thus partially reducing the accumulation of TMA. Some people require lifelong L-Carnitine, Choline, or Betaine supplementation (due to certain genetic diseases), and some of them get this foul body odor because of the TMA. In numerous case reports, an oral Riboflavin supplement mostly or completely eliminated the fishy odor, allowing people to keep taking L-Carnitine, Choline, or Betaine without this side effect. Riboflavin has been effective in reducing the body odor in most subjects in these case reports.
