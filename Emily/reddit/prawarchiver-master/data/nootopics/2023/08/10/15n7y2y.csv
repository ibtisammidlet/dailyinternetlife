qdouble,"Bromantane, ALCAR + caffeine can work as a good stimulant alternative…but it won’t address every symptom of ADHD. No one compound addresses every ADHD symptom, so you have to stack variety of compounds to fully address it. There’s nothing natural that work exactly like Adderall….but given the downsides of long term amphetamine use, that’s not a bad thing.",1691664122,jvkg84i,t3_15n7y2y,t3_15n7y2y,13,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jeannnnnnnnnn,"There's non-addictive stimulants like the ones mentioned. But they are not equal in strength compared to higher dosed prescribed stimulants.

You don't need typical stimulants for mindless tasks. You do have the possibility of planning life out to only doing mindless/simple stuff and thus not needing a stim, even if having adhd. But you might want to consider a stim in other cases. For narcolepsy, daytime sleepiness and adhd you can also use modafinil btw. But modafinil was not fit to keep me out of trouble(adhd).

If you have low dose stim prescribed and you want to replace no worries, substances mentioned by others (whose are not stimulants/addictive) will do. With higher doses prescribed, it is indicative that those might not be enough to fit your current situation.

In that case:

N-Methyl-Cyclazodone is an addictive stimulant, that can replace Vyvanse/(lis)dexamphetamine, which acts longer anecdotally",1691667572,jvklyfq,t3_15n7y2y,t3_15n7y2y,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Abewoods88,"There is always Sabroxy, you can get it at nootropic websites... combine it with ALCAR and caffeine or bromantane and you're off to a good deal.  Oroxylin A is the active alkaloid in sabroxy which is a DRI.  I think there is one website you can get oroxylin A (thevpure alkaloid from sabroxy that is a DRI), and that would work even better.  Phenylpiracetam could be helpful or other stim type racetams.  Also modafinil analogs, although some are less available because the countries who could make it for cheap are dealing with huge price difference and profit margins, are a good things to stack either in place of caffeine or with it.  There are other affordable thing like theacrine, theobromine, ephedra, dmaa, N-methyl-B Phenylmethlamine.  You'll have to figure out your stack and choose your risk vs benefit options. Some of these chems can be dangerous... ephedra has been connected to strokes according to the medical community fir one.  It is associated with stroke according to the community.  I wouldn't touch it. Good luck on your journey and always do THOROUGH research before consuming anything. Happy trails.

tapestry0fm0lecules,"Just thought I would add to what you said,, also just because the adderall is working for every area of adhd doesn’t mean it will continue to, and without possible help from nootropics or supplements later the adderall will become way less effective. I’ve personally switched from prescription stims from when I was in 11 through my early thirty’s and I’m 38 now I use

200mcg NA semax up each nostril from Everychem
2-3 sprays of bromantane from Everychem
25mg noopept oral two or three times
I’m adding alcar and I take NALT 500mg x2

This has me reading,  recalling memories and information I’ve learned I make wayless mistakes at work. I’m more even tempered for my children I forget less things literally everything I got from Classic prescription stimulants I get from his things, but I don’t get like the speed is the only thing but the rest of the mental stuff is there.
