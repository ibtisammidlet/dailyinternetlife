**Guys ,**

**I'm recovering from CNBS abuse (not addiction). I seem to have developed racing thoughts and memory issues. But i have quit smoking and its been close to half a year now but I want to compliment my recovery and strengthen my nervous system fatigue and my cognition. Would any one have a suggestive stack of vitamins or supplements for recovery ? Thank you !**",False,t5_4aoxhu,Improving working memory after using cnbs for 5 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15md4d9/improving_working_memory_after_using_cnbs_for_5/
