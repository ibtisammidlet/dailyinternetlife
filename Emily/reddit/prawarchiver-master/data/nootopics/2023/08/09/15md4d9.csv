0phenyl,"Probably a good idea to look into PanSterone:

Pregnenolone is great for reversing cannabis-induced memory deficits, and DHEA co-administered with Pregnenolone (which is what PanSterone is) would be beneficial for increasing male hormone levels such as T and DHT which would be helpful for general fatigue and cognition as well.

Quite a few people in the NooTopics discord are experimenting with it now, there is even an anecdote stating it was very beneficial for weed-induced anhedonia (tiredness, fatigue, low energy) and having more drive/motivation.",1691600767,jvgsbj1,t3_15md4d9,t3_15md4d9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

DrBobMaui,"Thanks for this idea, it's very interesting and helpful!

I would like to try it as I have both Dhea and Pregnenolone capsules so I wanted to ask if you could suggest a starting dose of each? I am a 77 year old ancient aging artifact guy and have some short term memory deficits and symptoms of low T.

Much thanks in advance for any suggestions and all the best for 2024 too!",1705678167,kilkpc5,t3_15md4d9,t1_jvgsbj1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

0phenyl,"DHEA and Preg directly elevate T and DHT because they are precursors to them in the steroidogenesis process. E2 can increase with oral DHEA supplementation or topical if dose is higher than 18mg (Source: [https://www.hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Labrie%2007%20Percutaneous%20DHEA%20to%20T,%20E1%20E2%20JSBM.pdf](https://www.hormonebalance.org/images/documents/Labrie%2007%20Percutaneous%20DHEA%20to%20T,%20E1%20E2%20JSBM.pdf))

harry_lawson,"The first link is curious as it doesn't actually show any causal link between DHEA supplementation and increase in serum T or E2. They say they measured the metabolites but don't put the serum values in. This leads me to believe the change was not statistically significant.

,"As I said in another comment.

I'm trying to get more info of people from the community about TAK-653.

I'm very very curious, because I study the cognitive neurogenetics of high intelligence.

I have no found nootropics that actually increase IQ because of an actual enhancement in cognitive capacity. Is it legit?

I think that if we understand the complex and dynamic interactions of plasma sex hormones and most effective neuromodulators and neuroendocrine system, like dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and histamines, we can create an accurate model of the brain, genes and cognition for cognitive enhancement.

Are you planning to report results of actual improvement with a  psychological test like WAIS-IV or something?

I'm curious about TAK-653 because it seems very selective and with some of the specific effects I'm searching, like some studies about IQ and relation to recognition memory and working memory.

Unfortunately, I can't find an actual scientist that is doing research with this.",1693140110,jxy95jj,t3_15md4d9,t1_jxvfwar,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
