neuro__atypical,"chronic nmda antagonist use is horrible for you, an adenosine agonist is unlikely to do anything

just skip the middle men and use istradefylline if you want caffeine without tolerance, the problem is that caffeine isn't selective, caffeine tolerance does **not** occur through A2A antagonism",1693057258,jxtsmr5,t3_161ri8i,t3_161ri8i,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sis0ran,Is that so? There are plenty of people who take agmatine or magnesium daily and as far as I know they act as nmda antagonists,1693121642,jxxk5g1,t3_161ri8i,t1_jxtsmr5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
redditlass,"When you say tolerance isn't due to a2a adenosine receptor, does this mean the a2a receptor normalises almost instantly after caffeine leaved your system?",1693248748,jy4jtqw,t3_161ri8i,t1_jxtsmr5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"there are plenty of people who do it, just like there are people who take amphetamines daily. sporadic use is fine, chronic use of nmda antagonist *drugs* is anti-cognitive and excitotoxic. magnesium is a nutrient and far too weak of an nmda antagonist to cause harm even when taking the l-threonate version. nmda antagonism isn't agmatine's primary effect, its nmda mechanism is more complex, and it is also endogenous and weak.",1693159603,jxzjy46,t3_161ri8i,t1_jxxk5g1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"istradefylline is an a2a antagonist just like caffeine, and has no tolerance or withdrawal effects whatsoever

i'm not 100% sure but IIRC caffeine touching other adenosine receptors is what causes issues like tolerance and withdrawal, they might indirectly actually cause a2a to up/downregulate also

what we know for sure is that a2a antagonism is possible without tolerance, that's what istrsadefylline does, so it's either because of other receptors caffeine touches or istradefylline antagonizes a2a in a different way",1693249717,jy4mdyy,t3_161ri8i,t1_jy4jtqw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

redditlass,"From looking here it seems a2a antagonists do cause tolerance https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/164os02/how_long_do_adenosine_a1_receptors_take_to/

Any thoughts on that?

Perhaps the drug you mentioned targets the a2a receptors in a different way than caffeine, that results in no tolerance",1693511729,jykea7o,t3_161ri8i,t1_jy4mdyy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"i already clarified my intent. i very well might have details wrong about magnesium and agmatine, but ask sirsadalot or anyone else who knows what they're talking about here, and they'll tell you that in general chronic nmda antagonist use is horrible for you. sirsadalot repeats it pretty often in the nootopics discord.",1693163180,jxzsut5,t3_161ri8i,t1_jxzrjhh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"a2a antagonists can cause tolerance, but do not necessarily, and nothing in that thread really conflicts with the idea that a2a antagonists don't inherently have tolerance. as i said, it could be due to downstream effects from other adenosine receptors caffeine touches, or as you said, it could be due to some small difference in the way that caffeine antagonizes a2a compared to istradefylline.

unfortunately this isn't my area of expertise, but this has been discussed on the nootopics discord server.",1693516100,jykqb2a,t3_161ri8i,t1_jykea7o,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
