Hxmusa,"I had symptoms of bradycardia, my Fitbit showed continued use of Guanfacine would drop my heart rate everyday. It went to 54 rhr and I was using 1mg. 

Discontinued use of it and it went back to normal (60). I was probably using too strong of a dose. That‚Äôs the only side effect there was. Other than that, it was brilliant for anxiety and focus.",1692190424,jwfa85r,t3_15s7gdw,t3_15s7gdw,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

BigWhat55535,"Works well for me. Removes the side effects of stimulants. When I went off it for some days recently, I was less organized, so it does seem to work. If your son is drowsy for a bit, hold out. It takes about two or three weeks for fatigue to die down on any given dose. If it persists beyond that, then maybe reconsider.",1692206078,jwgfr4x,t3_15s7gdw,t3_15s7gdw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
MR_BreaDHead,"I will restrain from being one of those people that gets excited cause I found something that works. I am adhd and was prescribed guanfacine but after reading so many different experiences I choose not to take it. 

So the fun part, I did a ton of research and found the following https://www.psychiatryredefined.org/low-dose-lithium/.

So I ordered some lithium Orotate and I am day 3, when I say I feel amazing I literally mean it. My behaviour has completely changed I have a ton of natural energy, 3pm sugar hit is gone and the most important aspect for me intrusive racing thoughts are gone. 

I suggest you do your research I am not a doctor nor is this medical advise. Dr James greenblatt was the answer for me.

BigWhat55535,"Yes, definitely keep him off stimulants as long as you can. As a kid, they made me apathetic and disrupted my social development. Since he has autism, that would be even worse for him.

I recommend if you do implement stimulants, to make use them as-needed. Especially if you can pair stimulants with a kind of 'study time' and build up good habits that way. Just a suggestion.",1692206184,jwgg1zw,t3_15s7gdw,t1_jwd9916,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
