UPDATE
So for the last few days, everything seems to be going well, he’s more calm definitely more organized with his thinking and he seems to be happier. Last night a few hours after he fell asleep, he woke up in excruciating pain crying couldn’t walk couldn’t put any weight on his right leg was cramping it was hurting and he’s five with autism and couldn’t explain it. It was rather alarming after finding out that’s a rare but not serious side effect. I decided to call the doctor today but anyone experience that.?

Edit is this drug similar to clonidine. Which my dr so  graciously give me for my ADHD. I just hold onto them for anxiety",False,t5_4aoxhu,"My son was prescribed Guanfacine.

Upon taking Uridine, ALCAR & Alpha GPC right away for 2 days straight I noticed a heavy and dark instance of learned helplessness coming up as-well as very dark thoughts even suicidal thoughts for I would say 48 hours roughly maybe slightly more.

I'm not quite sure if these were symptoms of withdrawal from my porn addiction (which can happen from personal experience, maybe not quite to that intensity however) or just cholline overdose for my brain, or maybe I've read Uridine may reduce dopamine release which may already be very low from the addiction recovery, correct me on that.

Dosing L-tyrosine seemed to eleviate alot of the symptoms for a while and I've read it may reduce  Acetylcholine levels but again I'm not too sure and I don't wanna pull stuff out of my ass, it could've just provided me with more dopamine that my brain needed.

&#x200B;

I know I made a mistake taking them all together instead of trying each compound one by one to see how they each affected my mood and well-being.

I already suspected there could be a correlation between me eating too many eggs and feeling like shit before although I very much didn't get enough evidence or made enough changes in my diet to verify this.

They were having a glitch in the payment system and they eventually refunded my money. 

I’ve since placed an order which went through without issues.

Thought I would post this update since I had raised some questions about the company in the last post.

Based on the responses I got the company seems very reputable though sometimes customer service can be slow.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Everychem: very much a reputable vendor,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15r2nnd/everychem_very_much_a_reputable_vendor/
