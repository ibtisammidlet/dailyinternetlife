qdouble,"Get a milligram scale and try switching to powders so you can dial in your dose better. Everyone has different sensitivities. I can take a lot of cholinergic compounds without noticing adverse effects, while someone else may take the same amount and experience negative side effects. You’re only going to find what dosage is right for you through experimentation.",1692093175,jw9ipgi,t3_15rn208,t3_15rn208,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

gnootynoots26,I’ve been diagnosed with adhd and I’m extremely sensitive to cholinergic nootropics. It’s to the point that I can’t really take much of anything without noticing a drop in mood.,1692144352,jwd0t9a,t3_15rn208,t3_15rn208,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
juloaj,"I'm not sure if I have ADHD, I've never explored this possibility or the possibility of being diagnosed with having ADHD, so I have no idea. I'll try ALCAR and Uridine on there own just to see at some point just to see what happens, right now I stopped fish oil too to make sure I reduce my choline levels",1692177936,jweos36,t3_15rn208,t1_jw9nldt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

gnootynoots26,Mostly things that effect acetylcholine and serotonin. They both seem to make me lethargic and moody. This makes supplementing difficult because some of the most recommending vitamins/supplements effect both acetylcholine and serotonin. Fasoracetam is one of the exceptions for me. In general I do better with dopaminergic compounds.,1692886949,jxk1zwd,t3_15rn208,t1_jwf4moh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"That's fair, I thought piracetam might be helpful in relieving choline depression since it uses it up. I'm like you though and get choline depression. It sucks, but it's good we're aware of it.",1692118616,jwb3oxg,t3_15rn208,t1_jwatd8m,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
