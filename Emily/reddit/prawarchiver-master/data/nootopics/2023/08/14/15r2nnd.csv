infrareddit-1,Thanks for the update. I have found Everychem to be cutting edge and high quality. And the owner of the company jumps on this subreddit regularly with informative posts and answers to questions.,1692047458,jw71gso,t3_15r2nnd,t3_15r2nnd,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Tiny_E_NYC,"I had a bad experience with their Tropisetron HCL; it gave me severe depression. And their TAK-653 has Propolyene Glycol (which isn‚Äôt listed on their website) which I‚Äôm very allergic to. Both droppers were not sealed with anything & opened way to easily. I‚Äôve sent 3 emails and no reply. I would love to try their Carnosic Acid, but since a full ingredient list isn‚Äôt on their website and they have non-existent customer service, I can‚Äôt rationalize supporting a company that doesn‚Äôt care to even reply. Especially one that‚Äôs suppose to be about helping people help their well being. I‚Äôve been emailing since mid-July.",1692511321,jwyqnov,t3_15r2nnd,t3_15r2nnd,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sispants,"Have ordered 3 bottles of Bromantane from them and was very pleased (was across two orders - 1 bottle in the first, 2 in the second). Shipped and arrived quickly, especially the second order. Definitely legit and it helped resolve some issues I was having with suppressed Dopamine production from long-term use of 5-HTP.

Note that the sprayer on the first did stop working before I finished the bottle, but not a big issue. As sprayers go they are good quality, shit just happens sometimes. I emptied the bottle into a different nasal sprayer and was good to go. No issues at all with the sprayer on the second two!

They also included a nice factsheet with the orders that give deets on how the compound works, dosing per spray, and the makeup of the solution it was suspended in. Thought that was a nice touch.",1692989802,jxqc0c1,t3_15r2nnd,t3_15r2nnd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

neuro__atypical,"what's good for getting off benzos depends on what you're trying to do, tropisetron and carnosic acid are anxiolytic (and the latter also sedative) in different ways than benzos, cortexin helps with benzo withdrawal and tapering and is gabaergic. bromantane reduces social anxiety. pinealon and neboglamine might be helpful too but i know less about them.

sodium valproate should never be used except as a last resort for mood stabilization and seizures. it's specifically known for its terrible side effect profile. beta blockers are also not great (edit: for this purpose, and IIRC they do have some kind of minor physiological withdrawal effect). the everychem way is to use drugs which have no tolerance, no potential for dependence and withdrawal, and no (or few and minimal) adverse effects.",1692061525,jw81507,t3_15r2nnd,t1_jw7vgij,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I used at in the past with great success, all liver values were fine and i also hadn't had any other side effects",1692064775,jw88ttu,t3_15r2nnd,t1_jw81507,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

890-2345,"Not OP but re: seizures, valproate is actually okay as a first option. It's cheap, and it works on virtually all kinds of seizures while not exacerbating any specific one. Plus, valproate doesn't negatively impact mood unlike most other antiseizure meds (which typically worsen depression).

I've also read that it reopens the critical period, but it's just one study.",1692085114,jw98abz,t3_15r2nnd,t1_jw8drmq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drogison,"I have an anxiety disorder and often suffer from tremors which Valpraot helps a lot with. Much better than the SSR√çs which iI'm also on. 

Furthermore, it raises BDNF and other growth factors in the brain and is also a aromatase inhibitor and actually increases the production of androgens in the body (I don't know how significant these effects are).

The main reason doctors are afraid of it is the possibility of severe liver damage, but quite rare and in most cases only transient. You can still counter this damage by taking TUDCA and NAC. But still, get your liver values checked regularly.",1692107660,jwaa5ee,t3_15r2nnd,t1_jw8drmq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
