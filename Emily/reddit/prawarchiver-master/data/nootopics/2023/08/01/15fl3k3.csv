Jeannnnnnnnnn,"Also, I am too now discontinueing Vyvanse and using Bromantane.

I just ordered Nefiracetam, it appears to be good at attenuating/reverse effects of (meth)amfetamine use, and normalizes GABA (which I suspect might be dysregulated for me and other adhd'ers)

To stack on top or cycle in series",1690964161,jugg3jc,t3_15fl3k3,t3_15fl3k3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
dnpv,"I have the same question. I know the original prescription russian bromantane (Ladasten) was meant to be taken for 28 days or 4 weeks only. Effects were long term, suggesting epigenetic changes. Maybe taking more or less than 28 days the effects are different? idk",1690920576,jue0auf,t3_15fl3k3,t3_15fl3k3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

CadillacDale,"Don't think you need to cycle it necessarily to avoid any adverse effects or anything like that. For me personally, I find that it's potency diminishes to the point of zero return after 10-14 days of consistent usage. Others I've read can feel the benefits indefinitely.

TL;DR: no reason that you can't take it indefinitely, but it may lose the desired effect after about two weeks.",1690935498,juf1lfq,t3_15fl3k3,t3_15fl3k3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jeannnnnnnnnn,"I've used Bromantane extensively.
Yes! You do need to cycle. 

It's not perse that anything bad will happen with a clear neurochemical cause, but it does commonly tend to produce hypomania after prolonged use (for me after ~2months continues use)

And that is not desirable, you'll take on more than you can handle.



So either take some breaks or maybe take a really low dose",1690963764,jugflup,t3_15fl3k3,t3_15fl3k3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
callStackNerd,"I've been taking it every other day. If I take it two days in a row I feel hypomanic, overstimulated, and uncomfortable.

SunDevil329,"The honest answer is nobody really knows. I'm fairly certain /u/sirsadalot would say that bromantane *does not* need to be cycled (but he's tagged in case I'm wrong).

Having used bromantane for the better part of a year (at least), I'd generally concur that it doesn't require cycling. I've never noticed any indication of dependence or addiction, pretty sure you're safe on that. I've taken long breaks here and there without major issue.

That said, whether it's simply my body adapting to the effects or actual tolerance, I definitely don't get the same effects that I used to.

I notice if I've been taking it regularly and then stop I'll be tired and sluggish for a few days. I'd say this is to be expected, similarly to what happens if you're regularly taking your ADHD meds and miss a dose. The effects are far less pronounced with bromantane, but it's there.",1690938253,juf7w4t,t3_15fl3k3,t3_15fl3k3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

AromaticPlant8504,Have used it on and off for a while. Sublingually around ~20mg.

Jeannnnnnnnnn,"Idk, I happen to be also using Agmatine with it. Didn't notice any problems, but this is the first time I'm pairing the 2.

Don't know the actual science, but I read certain good things about Agmatine, I think it could possibly even stabilise/normalise certain things. So as it could impose risk, it could also eliminate it, not much known.",1690965941,jugibqt,t3_15fl3k3,t1_juggnay,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
