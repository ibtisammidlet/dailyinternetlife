As stated previously been using daily bromantane this past week ( seven days ) to boost dopamine post vyvanse use.

 Not much info i can find on how long i can run this for ? I understand it doesnt have withdrawls and supposedly leaves tyrosine hydroxolase upregulated ?

Also if i have to take days off it , would Semax be a good alternative ?
