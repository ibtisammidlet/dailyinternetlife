Nebivolol is a good option for reducing BP too, it has lower sides than the other 'ol drugs. Remember that Telmisartan and Nebivolol have a synergistic effect on lowering blood pressure.",1693159611,jxzjytb,t3_162usyi,t3_162usyi,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
RowanRedd,"Started taking it recently (been trying to get it through system for 7 months but they kept refusing, mainly wanted it for downstream effects that aren’t certain = ace2 upregulation) and it’s pretty great. Hasn’t solved the main issues but has zero side effects, is somewhat physically anxiolytic, increases cardio endurance, chronically optimises BP (even on dAmph+2x150mg moclobemide it is generally something like 116/72 -sometimes slightly above 120 but diastolic always low 70 or even 66). 

Furthermore (can’t really verify), it blocks prefrontal oxidative stress induced by amphetamine and could reverse downregulation of D3 expression by methamphetamine (animal study), is anti-inflammatory, PPAR-y/delta agonism could be helpful for cognition and insulin sensitivity/body composition among other things. 

Good thing about AT1 is also that chronic antagonism downregulates the receptor. So in terms of RAAS, the baseline after stopping would be improved as well instead of homeostatic worsening. 

So theoretically it is a pretty amazing compound and practically it most definitely has good effects, is cheap and practically doesn’t have side effects (can’t completely rule out individual differences).


As an added note: it depends on what you’re looking for. If it is simply lowering BP, another ARB or class might be better (depends on the individual) but if you want neuro effects, telmisartan def the best ARB (most BBB penetrant and has PPAR-y/delta effects).",1693169636,jy08kkf,t3_162usyi,t3_162usyi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

deadlipht,"Thanks for providing the references, pretty much the same I do! 

Coming to prevent weight gain, the detailed paper is here: [https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.143958](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.109.143958)

There are two points worth mentioning: 

1. The study is based on mice. This is standard practice to conduct trials on mice before humans, but good for everyone to be aware that the data in the study is wrt mice. 
2. More importantly, the dosing of telmisartan was 5mg/Kg, which for a 70 kg person would mean 350 mg dose! This is impossibly huge. Whether a standard dosing of 40 mg/ 80 mg would provide proportional benefit of weight reduction, or there's no impact is unknown. Biological systems often are not linear, so there's little sense trying to extrapolate this lab data to real life data. 

Overall, a great post with handy references.
