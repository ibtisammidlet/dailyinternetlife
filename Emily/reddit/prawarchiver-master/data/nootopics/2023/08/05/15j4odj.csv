meesterfreeman,"I don't believe pramiprexole has the 5HTB2 agonism that can cause heart valve growth, it's not unselective like ergoline derivatives.

Still, dopamine agonists aren't particularly good unless you actually need them (high prolactin, RLS, parkinsons') and you won't notice much unless you do high doses which can cause downregulation and withdrawals. There's also the fact that D2 agonism isn't actually procognitive (more anticognitive) and prami has minimal D1 agonism to balance it out unlike the less selective drugs.

Nothing about this is nootropic really. Good if you want strong orgasms I guess?",1691275977,juyjofe,t3_15j4odj,t3_15j4odj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
hungariandog,"The first study I linked showed things like improved reaction speed, in healthy people 

Though they used 3mg intravenously which would be a high dose , perhaps they'd go through negative effects once its out of their system ?",1691276503,juykxik,t3_15j4odj,t1_juyjofe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,Respectfully there are many better options that wonâ€™t cause augmented dopamine receptors. For example adrafinil or Oroxylin-A,1691297638,juzrqe3,t3_15j4odj,t1_juykxik,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
hungariandog,"Perhaps, though if you spaced out taking it I believe you wouldn't augment the dopamine receptors

From what I read, this only happens of you take it for a daily for a month",1691325874,jv0uosi,t3_15j4odj,t1_juzrqe3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,This could be true but there is still a chance of pramipexole causing compulsive behaviors. There have been lawsuits of compulsive gambling and compulsive sexual conquests lol this drug comes with a long list of side effects,1691336276,jv1h0cw,t3_15j4odj,t1_jv0uosi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
