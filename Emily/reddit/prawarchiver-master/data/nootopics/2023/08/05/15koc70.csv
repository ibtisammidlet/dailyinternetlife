lambjenkemead,"are you trying to treat depression directly? I think most Kanna Extracts are more potent intranasally. I did see a method also where someone put the powder into a piece of toilet paper and and turned it into a a snuff pouch for under theyre lip and said it hit hard. A good Kanna Extract when it hits should be very noticeable. Its got a bit of an MDMA vibe thought nowhere near that level of intensity. Overall I don't think zembrin or related products is a valid way to treat depression long term. I'd try the Agmatine, NSI 189 and Tak 653 personally. Much better results. 

As a rule, I try not to fuck with serotonin or Gaba too much. THere is always a price to pay eventually when you do.",1691426151,jv6g2rc,t3_15koc70,t3_15koc70,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
tgf2008,I had exactly zero results when I used Doctor’s Best Zembrin. It was a few years ago so I can’t remember the dosage but it was at least as much as what was recommended on the bottle.,1691426671,jv6hgp5,t3_15koc70,t3_15koc70,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"Might just not be for you. 25-50mg works well for me, even as-needed. It's not a huge difference, but a mild mood boost and a dose of calm.",1691438569,jv7dcb2,t3_15koc70,t3_15koc70,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sea-Needleworker-728,"If you’re set on using Kanna, get mt55 extract and insufflate. The first time I tried it, I took only 40mg intranasally, and a few minutes later an intense wave of nausea and a buzzing feeling hit me and I had to lay down. This unpleasant feeling lasted about 15 minutes, then faded away and I was left with an extreme concentration, and good mood for  more than a few hours. Next time I cut the dose in half and had an equally intense wave, but the positives after were slightly decreased",1691459304,jv8sn3l,t3_15koc70,t3_15koc70,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MrNeverEverKnew,"Thanks. I will try out the toilet paper snus like pouch thing. I also heard of doing pouches/kanna snus by oneself by buying empty pouches and filling in the Kanna. 

I definitely seemed to have the same thoughts about intranasal being stronger and more potent but I‘m not sure if Zembrin can be taken intranasally and mostly I just dislike the thought of insufflating something via nose… But if stronger extracts won‘t work neither I will surely have to try the intranasal ROA.",1691427157,jv6irjk,t3_15koc70,t1_jv6g2rc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MrNeverEverKnew,"Recommended on the bottle is one capsules of 25mg. I do take 2-4 now as before one or two didn‘t work neither, first orally, then sublingually. Now after a few days break I started doing 2-4 of 25mg sublingually and still nothing, so in total my priming I‘m doing is for a longer time than only these 4 days by now.",1691427260,jv6j1hm,t3_15koc70,t1_jv6hgp5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Pure_Nourishment,"Zembrin, orally. Have tried other Kanna and it's way too strong. Makes sense for recreational use, but I'm looking to treat depression.

Honestly might just be going back on SSRIs though.

25-50mg of Zembrin is definitely noticeable and helpful for me personally.",1691533806,jvd46kr,t3_15koc70,t1_jvckvuy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
