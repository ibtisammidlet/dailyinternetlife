But nothing so far. Short time after 20-30 minutes of sublingual intake and then swallowing I feel a short feeling of relief of my symptoms and mood enhancement. But it‘s rather subtle, probably placebo, and away again very soon.

Anyone else who has been experimenting with Zembrin or having similar experiences?

Is 100mg for 4 days (5 days if I should continue tmrw) of Zembrin per day too much? I usually take 50-75mg at once sublingually and then another 25mg-50mg sublingually later.

Shouldn‘t I feel something?
Any tips? Am I doing sth wrong?

It can damage the heart even a therapeutic doses, something amphetamine does not do for example.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/e1ogal/pramipexole_any_nootropic_benefit/f8r21h6/
