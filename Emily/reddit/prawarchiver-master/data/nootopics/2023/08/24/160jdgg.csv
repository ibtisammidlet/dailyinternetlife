It hits a lot of areas in the brain (DNRI in a different way than Rilatin, 5HT3 antagonism, nAChr antagonism, downregulates imidazoline receptors, etc).

Earesth99,"Both impact dopamine. I tried it for that reason, but it didn’t help my mdd.  (I also take adderal so i might have been getting all I could through dopamine already)

I tried shrooms, and it was like a switch was flipped. Next day I was me again after 18 months of darkness.

Sispants,Can’t speak to the exact similarities but Wellbutrin is known to have an effect of improving your ability to focus making it a good antidepressant for people who have both ADHD and depression in conjunction. That focus-improving effect isn’t so strong that it can be considered a direct replacement for Adderall though.,1694534112,k09tb07,t3_160jdgg,t1_jxnipzt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sispants,"Had a similar experience with shrooms. Unfortunately for me it was accidentally taking way too much and spending 3 hours convinced I had died and was moving through purgatory. One of the worst experiences of my life. Once I got through that night though, I felt more like myself than I had in a couple years. 

Would I recommend a mega-trip approach though? No definitely not lol. But I’m exploring microdoses and occasional mini-trips now.",1694534571,k09um1y,t3_160jdgg,t1_jxozpcm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

When I take other things, I’ve both focused on increasing bdnf by taking lions mane, lithium, or 7,8 dhf.  Haven’t noticed anything from those independent if mushrooms.

I will try that the next time.

Earesth99,"Comfy setting. Chill music. 

Have the intention of addressing your depression (and thought patterns that might be related.) think through  that before you start and as you wait for launch.

In s clinical setting, 3 grams is more effective than two, but there are more likely to be weird things happening in your mind. 

They recommend wearing an eye mask.
