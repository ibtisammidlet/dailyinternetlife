XQCW_VIVON420,"These mentioned σ1 modulators have poor selectivity.  


The best σ1 allosteric modulator seems to be E1R (methylphenylpiracetam).  
The best σ1 agonist seems to be PRE-084.  


σ1 agonism can enhance addictive behaviors through enhanced dopamine release, so using a PAM agent rather than an agonist would likely be more desirable.",1692909261,jxlpzgc,t3_160aw17,t3_160aw17,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
sinsemillaseedz,"None of them are good. Potentially high dose afobazole, but it's just too expensive (at least with the sources I'm aware of) to maintain. You would also need to cycle it, as inevitably it would downregulate as I'm aware happened to someone with a crazy sigma-1 stack in the nootopics discord. I hope someday someone synthesizes methylphenylpiracetam.",1693782588,jz0nc1h,t3_160aw17,t3_160aw17,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Berberine is mostly for secondary diabetics or poor people with metabolism as an AMPK activator, but has sigma agonism as one of its mechanism. I used to use it in past and worked pretty well, giving bit like opioid like subtle feel what is different to most of this herbal stuff what I have done. Mayby that is due of sigma character of it, I dont know but intuitively I feel like it.",1694268801,jztf39h,t3_160aw17,t3_160aw17,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"If be hesitant to put too much weight on the receptor alone. The signaling cascades all would be extremely dependent on the biological context. 
I suppose a way to really see about it’s anxiolytic effects would be too compare luvox and other ssris in their treatment of anxiety.
But dxm is an agonist that’s easily accessible in lower doses it helps my depression. They actually patented it and Wellbutrin for depression.

But I believe cocaine, meth, dmt, and berberine are other agonists. I haven’t looked into it in a long time so I might be wrong.",1693548078,jympip5,t3_160aw17,t3_160aw17,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
antiepoch,"Oh my goodness, my brain clearly needs some of these things we talk about in this sub - you’re absolutely right about methylphenylpiracetam. I don’t know why is misremembered it, that is actually the one I meant to recall.

Can you tell me a little bit about how PAMs and agonists behave different with respect to reward/behavior? I’ve always been a little confused about the end effect even thought I know a PAM enhances activity at the receptor and an agonist is kind of like an on switch for the receptor itself. Also realize I could be wrong about that too though! Thank you so much for your reply.",1692917937,jxmc0dt,t3_160aw17,t1_jxlpzgc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

XQCW_VIVON420,"A PAM binds to the allosteric site on the receptor, enhancing endogenous production. It potentiates receptor activity that already exists basically. Agonists bind directly to the receptor itself (not the allosteric site), and they are different because they cause a surge in receptor activity rather than enhancing existing signals. The difference between PAMs and Agonists is heavily context dependent, and with σ1, allosteric modulators being less likely to be pro-addictive is speculation.",1692923192,jxmodja,t3_160aw17,t1_jxmc0dt,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
