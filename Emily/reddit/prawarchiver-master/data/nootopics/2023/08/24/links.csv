However, I don't have access to it at this time and I am searching for alternatives. Is there anything with a similar mechanism of action or just similar effects in general? I tried Bromantane but I didn't find it very effective.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Alternative to Wellbutrin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/160jdgg/alternative_to_wellbutrin/

What are some y’all know of and/or have tried? Here are the ones I know of:

- Opipramol (anti anxiety drug only available in the EU)
- Luvox/Fluvoxamine (SSRI that has sigma-1 agonism, more than related SSRIs like Prozac that also touch sigma-1)
- Fasoracetam (nootropic, hard to find/buy? weirdly not talked about much at all)
- Bromantane

It seems like research indicates sigma-1 activism could be a component of the anti anxiety effects of many psychiatric drugs. Lends itself to some of the hypothesis that certain mental health issues could be from issues with cellular metabolism.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Fasoracetam and other sigma-1 agonists,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/160aw17/fasoracetam_and_other_sigma1_agonists/
