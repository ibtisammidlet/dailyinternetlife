roco-j,"I bought it, on the same day, from pglchem (Ukraine), which is considered to be a reputable source, and the spray from everychem (Canada/USA I guess?)

The one from pglchem still has to arrive and I didn't receive any tracking; the spray from everychem arrived after approx two weeks after being stuck for a long time at German customs. And I could follow it with tracking number.",1691865741,jvwkk7r,t3_15ogp50,t3_15ogp50,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Bromantane seems to pass the customs, my last order (Bromantane, Tak, Selank, Semax) just passed the French customs without problem.

The only time it was seized was when there was Tropisetron in the package. I ignored that it was (or had been?) a prescription med for cancer-induced nauseas in my country.",1692959458,jxoc27j,t3_15ogp50,t3_15ogp50,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"Seconded, I'm in the Netherlands and have had 2 shipments from everychem arrive in approximately 7-10 days after ordering. Also know that you get what you get and it's quality lab-tested, gives peace of mind.",1691865919,jvwl0u7,t3_15ogp50,t1_jvwkk7r,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
roco-j,"Hey, I piggyback my own comment -- how much in terms of quantity did you get? As a first shipment I didn't want to risk it with customs so I tried the smallest amount possible. Now that it reached here safe and sound, I'm thinking of buying a greater quantity.",1691866682,jvwn0je,t3_15ogp50,t1_jvwl0u7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"Yeah I did the same when first ordering, let me check my history.

  
So 1st order was 84$, 3 items (on it's first domain)  
2nd was 180$, 8 items  
3rd was 330$, 10 items (1st order at current domain; contained lot of glassware).  
Zero trouble each time :)  
I'm currently compiling my 4th, cart is at 360$ atm. Just crying I can't order pinealon yet and I missed the 1st batch by a day :/  
Also for context, I'm not particularly rich haha",1691870739,jvwwzu4,t3_15ogp50,t1_jvwn0je,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
