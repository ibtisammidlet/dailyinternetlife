ilovedoxo,"First stop taking the NSI, then try some Valerian Root or Blue Skullcap. These are anxiolytics with muscle relaxant properties. A weaker anxiolytic would be something like lemon balm or theanine",1691110030,jup6g0l,t3_15hk2hw,t3_15hk2hw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spartuhns2,"I figured it out so NSI is amazing for me in some parts. But bad in others ? I get terrible muscle spasms which kind of scares me/makes me anxious. Makes me wonder if I’m having some kind of neurotoxicity or excitotoxicity. But I figured out taking CBG, is an a2 agonist like guanfacine but also has some gabaergic properties as well, completely takes away the muscle spasms and anxiety. Literally amazing. NSI is amazing in the way of being sociable I’ve constantly been tryna find a substance to help socialize but either none of them work, or the ones that do have terrible withdrawals and aren’t sustainable. NSI seems like the only substance that’s been helping me come out of my shell without necessarily being some super euphoric substance",1691279766,juys7w9,t3_15hk2hw,t1_juy1nrb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
