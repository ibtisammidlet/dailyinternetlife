bsdcat,"maybe tropisetron (nicotinic and focus-enhancing, but in a different way than phenylpiracetam is). pramiracetam could work too.",1691169811,jusbs34,t3_15hu8ms,t3_15hu8ms,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TigerEye408,"Following. Musician here too. Years ago I have used Phenylpiracetam, and CDP- Choline Which did better than alpha GPC. 
Recent times doing session work for the labels, I‚Äôm learning on the spot and writing the parts over and better getting points on the record. 
I have used TAK-653 with Tropisetron, some days then added PRL-8-53 and a choline source for PRL (either 2 hard boiled eggs or CDP-Choline. And had fantastic results. 
Also have had a low dose of adderall or Armodafinil. With Tak-653 + Tropisetron. And difference was adderall felt like the reward button was stuck on. These are amazing days doing half a day in music and other half assembling guitar pickups, or doing tedious fret work. 
Just hide your phone‚Ä¶ this stack makes you want to zoom in on info. Put phone in a timer lock case. 

Armo with tak and Tropisetron 2 eggs, was more clear and that particular day was very long so, I powered right through the writing part, and production, learned/wrote new, then laser focus working the DAW computer software, locked in and not underwhelmed. 

Never stacked armo with tak, trop, prl853, choline. 
But from these experiences with low dose adderall. I see armo being less dopamine oriented.",1691409084,jv5cwd5,t3_15hu8ms,t3_15hu8ms,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"Original piracetam everyday with alpha gpc 
Pramiracetam will give laser focus not much mood boost. I didn‚Äôt care for it. Being a musician I would recommend piracetam everyday 4-7grams (split3x a day) and phenylpiracetam for more stressful days or learning days etc. always pair with alpha gpc it Synergizes, I think better than such a clean, even though they both essentially do the same thing as the choline source.
Edit spelling
Also days that require phenylpiracetam stack on top of piracetam that day. Also oxiracetam stacked with aniracetam and piracetam (‚Äúpao‚Äù stack if you look it up) might be right up your alley also dose of phenyl 125mg",1691440670,jv7j28y,t3_15hu8ms,t3_15hu8ms,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

lies_hate_me,I appreciate the input. PRL gives me a massive headache no matter how much choline I take with it. Maybe I need to reduce the dose? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,1693337041,jy9t6xd,t3_15hu8ms,t1_jv5cwd5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lies_hate_me,"Hey thanks for your input. I appreciate it. I‚Äôll look into to sourcing some cheap piracetam.

In the meantime I‚Äôm experimenting with a centrophenoxine and noopept stack that I kind of like.

I‚Äôve tried bothe oxi and ani years ago and I remember ‚Äútweaking out‚Äù on things so maybe that would be good for me right now.

Edit I also love noopept 30mg oral I find two three times a day
Aniracetam I would also take two or three times a day with the noopept and the other I would take twice a day how are you taking it",1693455314,jyh6f3e,t3_15hu8ms,t1_jy9tyuk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
