Instead of being able to focus on one thing at a time, my brain is geared towards focusing on many things at once which I’ve used to my advantage in my studies of quantum physics and understanding the nature of reality.

But I started taking classical lessons and as I am practicing only one part of my mind is focused on the guitar while other parts are focused on many other things at once which makes my learning seem slower than someone else who is laser focused.

I’ll be practicing and simultaneously thinking about buying school books, the golden ratio, the physical manifestation of pi, some cute chick I saw yesterday, wondering what my dad is up to, my 85 year old grandmother, a customer who pissed me off a week ago, ableton live, getting a space heater for the winter, tweaking my budget, exercising, cooking etc etc etc

I took phenylpiracetam for years and loved it but am having trouble finding the non hydrazide 

What racetam would you people recommend to help me be able to focus on just my damn guitar?

Pramiracetam? Or perhaps some new racetam I haven’t heard of? Maybe not a racetam at all?

I would appreciate your help",False,t5_4aoxhu,Which racetam for classical lessons?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15hu8ms/which_racetam_for_classical_lessons/
