ResearchSlore,"There are glutamatergic neurons originating in the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei/MDTN which project to the PFC, and locally applying NAC to either the MDTN or the PFC can inhibit their release of glutamate. [\[ref\]](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/prp2.457) In the PFC, these glutamatergic neurons contact projections originating from the locus coeruleus/LC which co-release NE and DA.  [\[ref\]](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/9/11/746)

Amphetamine would directly act upon these LC neurons to increase cortical release of NE and DA, and NAC could presumably counteract this to some extent (by reducing baseline excitatory drive). The mechanism would be cysteine oxidation to the disulfide cystine, which is taken up by astrocytes in exchange for glutamate. The glutamate then binds to mGluR2 on the glutamatergic MDTN neurons to inhibit their release of glutamate in the PFC.

More generally, I wonder if these co-releasing LC neurons are overlooked in amphetamine's MoA for two main reasons:

* IC50 for NET uptake assays is often orders of magnitude higher than IC50 for DAT uptake assays for many ""dopaminergic"" stimulants. [\[ref\]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/164_2018_113) In theory, these stimulants could produce PFC DA release at concentrations much lower than expected by entering co-releasing terminals via NET and then dissipating the pH gradient of DA synaptic vesicles (via their VMAT2 activity).
* Local application of d-amphetamine in the NAc/ventral striatum produces a fivefold increase in extracellular DA, yet has no effect on locomotor activity. Systemic d-amphetamine increases extracellular NAc DA (even with concurrent NAc local application) and produces locomotor activity, and both of these effects of systemic d-amphetamine can be blocked by local application of alpha1 antagonist in PFC. In other words, much of amphetamine's DAergic activity may be an indirect result of increased NE release.

genericaccount2019,"Amphetamines increase glutamate in certain areas of the brain. NAC is thought to upregulate the glutamate transporter (GLT-1) which removes excess glutamate from certain areas of the brain, such as the nucleus accumbens, which dampens the effect amphetamines have. While NAC may increase glutathione it’s effects are far different than what you would experience from simply  taking glutathione itself.",1693364994,jybra2l,t3_1652h96,t3_1652h96,12,False,t5_4aoxhu
bostocked,"Interesting question, my only input would be through my own experimentation is that I have adhd and a rough trend I see is that those who have dopaminergic ""abnormalities"" as seen in attention type disorders seem to be more susceptible to a relaxing effect on it I know I definitely do. One prominent effect I do notice is a reduced effect on the cardiovascular system if I took them both at the same time or within half life ""cross overs"" so I concur with what another commenter said that at the very least it is effecting NE either directly suppressing or some sort of downstream effect, which would explain why I get a reduced NE response if on both, but I don't know we'd have to get some sort of study together maybe.

stinkykoala314,"Glutathione supplements enhance the effect of stimulants for me. I've tried pill-based glutathione supplements, all with no clear impact, but the glutathione from ResearchedNutritionals, which you guzzle directly from their weird sunscreen-like bottle  is the only one for which you can notice an effect. (This is not a shill, it's just literally the only oral formulation that seems to do anything. I'd guess that injected glutathione is even better, but haven't tried it yet.)

Anyway, on stimulant days I'll squeeze some sunscreen into my mouth, let it sit under my tongue for 60 seconds, then swallow. Always provides a slight boost to energy and focus.",1693396365,jyd26wq,t3_1652h96,t3_1652h96,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Anyone who feel fine while mixing - tell your dose of NAC too.
