Earesth99,"It assume you are doing the basic things like getting enough sleep, eating well and getting enough omega three fatty acids snd exercising?

Reddit may be a way to get suggestions, but I would strongly recommend that you verify the safety and efficacy of any recommendations that by looking at the scientific research before you try them. 

I‚Äôm not sure which specific tests were run to determine that you had a traumatic brain injury or neurological damage from drugs, but focusing on increasing BDNF support the survival of existing neurons and to encourage repair snd growth.

Lions mane and lithium are normal supplements that increase BDNF that are generally safe at usual doses.

I‚Äôve read that the peptides Semax and Selank are effective to increase bdnf, and have been used in Russia to help with cognitive function and anxiety. I‚Äôve found that the NA versions of both peptides exert a noticeable short-term effects on me, but there isn‚Äôt much published research on Russian peptides, so its hard to really know.

I have read that 7,8 DHF is more effective than endogenous BDNF and longer lasting, and it has also been studied as a way to help heal a TBI.  You can find 7,8 DHF on Amazon. 

Btw, I think that researchers believe that stem cells might help because they influence the expression of BDNF. 

Looking at BDNF sounds like a reasonable place to start - but I‚Äôm not a neurologist.

I eat very well (paleo diet, no alcohool, no processed food.), and I spend lot of time under sunlight.  


I didn't do any test which showed me all the damage in my brain but my brain was burning for 2 or 3 months because of dehydration and E2 level crash temporary.  (yes I know we can't feel anything in brain because there is no sensitivity receptors but the inflammation was huge  + light / noise sensitivity extremely high). And it made me very anhedonic. At first the confusion / brain fog / focus / memory were very bad. Now it improved but anhedonia is still horrible.  (I was already blunted because of Post Finasteride Symptom but not at the same degree.)  


and Indeed, I need to do my own research, In fact I asked this with already some knowledge (about cerebrolysin, cortexin, selank, semax, Mr Happy stack...) and I wanted to see if there was some things I could benefits.

Earesth99,"7,8 DHF is a naturally occurring flavone. I hadn‚Äôt heard of it either until I read about it on pubmed. There is a stronger (2.7x) version that lasts twice as long, but that version can cause sleep problems.  I just use the original.

I probably should have started by saying that, several years ago, I had some issues and it seemed obvious to me that my e2 was too my 2e. I thought I had a set of symptoms and I assumed, without getting bloodwork done, that the cause was high e2.  I tried to lower it, and ended up really crashing it.  On the positive side, once I had the bloodwork done, I could do the right things to fix it.

I‚Äôm just suggesting that your self-diagnosis about what was going on in your brain to cause the symptoms is really just a guess.  You might just try addressing each of the symptoms.  

In terms of the e2, make sure to get a complete hormone work up.  I feel better with a high level of test, and an above average e2, which isn‚Äôt unusual. E2, DHT, total test and free test are interconnected.  There are docs that focus on this, but I never found them to be helpful‚Ä¶",1692576620,jx2fcdz,t3_15vsrco,t1_jx1roin,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
