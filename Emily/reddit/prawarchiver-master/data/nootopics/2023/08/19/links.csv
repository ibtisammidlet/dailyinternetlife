I have TBI induced by drugs and dehydration (E2 level crash / high inflammation). (I did some errors, trying to recover from PFS.)  


In a few words : mostly lost of emotions / loss of IQ / blank mind.  
I've had confusion and memory loss but it improved a lot thanks the protocole I'm doing (joshua's protocole) and this point is now ok : not recovered but enough.   


I plan to try Stem cell injection later, but during this time, is there a way to help the brain to recover ?

I have probably a loss of dopaminergic neurones and I guess dopaminergic receptors.  


Thanks a lot for your suggestion. I am open-minded to every compounds, natural or not.
