neuro__atypical,Could be bad ALCAR. Could be that you have MTFHR issues that render it ineffective. Could be some other weird gene thing. Does it taste sour? Try taking a higher dose and do it consistently. I don't see any reason to combine it with berberine.,1691867402,jvwosxv,t3_15pcfa9,t3_15pcfa9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,"Try raising your ALCAR dose to 1,500mg. The effect of many supplements are subtle, so I may notice what their effect was more so when I stop taking them.",1691870442,jvww9l5,t3_15pcfa9,t3_15pcfa9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
icyeconomics42069,how tf do you have to ''recover'' from bromantane. Maybe you have some kind of gene mutation and therefore theye drugs dont work like they should?,1691876142,jvxa5m6,t3_15pcfa9,t3_15pcfa9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Stephane69,"I tried high quality alcar and bromantane, and the both don't work. 
They are telling you that you have gene mutation, don't listen to them. 
These substances don't work.",1691946474,jw0wg9j,t3_15pcfa9,t3_15pcfa9,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"I believe Berberine is best taken with a meal, particularly a high carb meal, as it lowers blood sugar.  Blood sugar can be low upon waking up, and Berberine could make it worse.

This is all just theory, please correct me if I’m wrong .",1691949346,jw140zy,t3_15pcfa9,t3_15pcfa9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
roco-j,"What's with the taste, should it tell if the substance is legit? It's capsules so I didn't taste anything, maybe I'll try opening one and seeing if it comes out as a powder or something.

MTFHR mutation I didn't know could be related to ALCAR. I have suspected it but never tested because I don't really know how, but I shall inform myself about it. i remember I was taking a good B complex (Jarrow) and it made me feel slightly different, maybe better, which is what led me to suspect a potential MTFHR issue.

Berberine I remember that sirsadalot recommended it to enhance dopamine absorption but I might be wrong or that info may be outdated...",1691867656,jvwpffa,t3_15pcfa9,t1_jvwosxv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Tiny_E_NYC,"I have MTHFR mutation, how does ALCAR effect it? Does that mean I have to supplement Methyl B-12 with it? I could’ve sworn it made me depressed taking it, but I’m a woman, who lives in NYC so who knows lol. Thank you!",1692858258,jxirwi2,t3_15pcfa9,t1_jvwosxv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"If ALCAR made you depressed then it might be because you're very sensitive to choline, probably nothing to do with MTHFR. I'm not an expert on MTFHR but most nootropics, especially anything dopaminergic like ALCAR, seem to be affected by it in some way.",1692897511,jxku6dj,t3_15pcfa9,t1_jxirwi2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
roco-j,"Hey, I casually returned to my old-ish thread and read your comment. I also suspect that ALCAR makes me depressed! I couldn't really be sure about it, but now that I have tried it on and off, like once a week or so, at different dosages, I can definitely say that the only noticeable effect is making me numb. I just get in a bad mood, anhedonic, no joy in anything. I noticed it because more than once I have tried it before going for a night out and every time it ended up having the opposite effect than the one I wished for.

Did you have any further insight about it, in the meantime? Is it for the MTFHR mutation, or perhaps choline sensitivity like the other commenter said?

Also, how does one suspect to have and then test for MTFHR mutation? And eventually, how do you treat that?",1695020057,k13fqrk,t3_15pcfa9,t1_jxirwi2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
