Bromantane I tried the spray from everychem yesterday for the first time and I definitely felt a noticeable effect.

I got ALCAR 1000mg + Berberine HCL 500mg from a German brand on Amazon.de which looked okay-ish and had good reviews. I figured out why not, they should be pretty common substances, right?

I took both this morning, on empty stomach, first Berberine then ALCAR about half an hour later.

I think I felt no effect whatsoever. I don't have a sensitive stomach but I've read of people being upset by them. Well, even though I didn't eat until a couple of hours later, I got no trouble with it, everything fine. Just no effects at all.

Today I also drank a little more coffee than usual (two cups instead of just one) and I feel like it didn't boost me much like it usually does.

So now I'm wondering either one of the following:

*ALCAR + Berberine actually smoothed out my dopamine levels without making me feel stimulated from coffee

*I'm somewhat ""recovering"" from yesterday's Bromantane, hence I feel slightly anhedonic today

*This ALCAR doesn't do jack sh!t to me and/or it's not good quality being from Amazon

What's your thoughts?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Is it possible to have received low quality ALCAR or is it just not working for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15pcfa9/is_it_possible_to_have_received_low_quality_alcar/
