neuro__atypical,"> I mean, technically exercise can be neurotoxic

Every single piece of evidence on exercise that we have suggests this is untrue. Exercise is neuroprotective. Cell death through overheating is a whole separate issue. Hitting your head is neurotoxic.

> The fact of the matter is that pharmaceutical doses of amphetamine seem to be remarkably safe, to the extent that long term medication appears to promote brain growth in those with adhd.

Amphetamine is safe in the sense that the adverse effects are well-documented and you can live a perfectly fine and healthy life while using it. It works great for millions of people. That doesn't mean it isn't neurotoxic and suboptimal. We can do better.

> I would argue that using an extremely well researched chemical that is known to only be very mildly neurotoxic at normal doses could be more rational than using less studied substances that could potentially have a small chance of larger harms (due to their short history of use, i.e. carnosic acid) depending on your risk tolerance.

When using drugs like amphetamine, you take on some very well-known risks *in addition* to unknown unknowns. There's a lot we don't know about amphetamine. The short and medium term adverse effects are well-documented, nitty gritty data on long-term effects at the neuronal and brain structure level are extremely scarce.

The risk of everychem drugs are purely unknown unknowns. Some of what we suggest has actually already been used for decades, like bromantane and tropisetron. They are safe and are well-documented to be such. We only advocate research chemicals like TAK-653 when they are extremely clean (no off-target effects) and theoretically sound based on everything known about neuroscience so far. There are always unknown unknowns, but I think it's silly to reject these on the idea that they might e.g. suddenly cause cancer through an incredibly obscure downstream mechanism after 30 years of use, that is somehow unpredictable under current neuroscience and chemistry knowledge.

Edit: also, the safety of a drug is purely a function of what it physically does in the body. We *do* have a lot of knowledge about AMPA PAMs. TAK-653 is a research chemical. But AMPA PAMs are well-studied and we know a lot about them. If it's a clean AMPA PAM (and it is), then it isn't new in the sense that a drug with a truly novel mechanism is new and unstudied.",1692154601,jwdoyq7,t3_15s8d62,t1_jwdbsc7,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

However, I figure that it is worthwhile to try to fully explain myself here now that I am at a keyboard instead of on my phone in case anyone finds it useful.


For the record though, here are the things that I neither said nor implied, here or elsewhere:


Amphetamine is completely safe

Long term amphetamine use at pharmacological doses has zero downsides

We know literally everything there is to know about amphetamines

Exercise is bad for your brain


With that being said:


Yes, obviously exercise is good for your brain, I would hope that would go without saying. It is in fact exactly my point that *despite* that fact exercise as a whole contains mechanisms that could potentially be bad if they existed in excess or weren't balanced out by good mechanisms. I don't know exactly where the research stands on the brain impacts specifically, but we know for the rest of the body (not just muscles, but e.g. immune system etc) the benefits are *heavily if not primarily* mediated through hormetic stress. Given that particularly high intensity exercise greatly increases systemic inflammation in the short term, it would greatly surprise me if part of its neuroprotective properties were not due to hormetic stress as well.


For almost any change that you induce to your biological system, including pharmacological, you can identify individual mechanisms that are probably good vs individual mechanisms that are probably bad, and you are left with getting above the mechanistic level to understand which wins out at what dosages over what time frames. To the extent that some things are purely good or bad for you, I'm guessing that it's probably easier to find things that are purely bad for you (e.g. lead) than the inverse.


In the case of amphetamines, we both know of mechanisms that are neurotoxic (don't need to get into those) and mechanisms that are neurogenerative (alpha2 agonism, CART peptides). We definitely know that at high dosages and onder other circumstances that its use is damaging in the long run. But we know that *at least for some people over some dosages and time extents* that it actually causes increases in brain connectivity and density. Therefore, just like the vast majority of pharmacologia, the risk/benefit analysis is highly dependent on dosage protocol and probably at least a dozen other things specific to the individual.


You state that amphetamine is not optimal and that we can do better. To that I agree, it would be highly unlikely that this one chemical that we discovered in the paleolithic (this is a metaphor, I just mean in the timeframe of modern pharmacology), is the one optimal drug for to increase focus/executive function, etc.


But the OP wasn't asking about that, the OP was asking about how to decrease neurotoxicity from a very moderate dosing regime of amphetamines. Strictly in terms of answering the question -- it is extremely important to understand how much effective neurotoxicity that is likely to be present at that dose. And, given the fact that some people take ~twice that amount at ~twice the frequency and can actually see *increases* in brain growth, it seems to me that the amount of neurotoxicity is likely to be not a large concern. Hell, some people are prescribes *4 times* that dose, and at the very least don't see anything like the sort of lasting brain damage that recreational users can get.


Again -- just to be clear -- I'm not saying that taking 60mg of adderall a day is good for your brain, I'm not recommending it, what I'm trying to do is contextualize the extremely important piece of information that the OP gave us that should be taken into account when determining the answer to his question, which is that his dosage regime is known to be extremely moderate.


In terms of the risk aversion point: yes, we clearly don't know everything there is to know about amphetamines, but that is a non-sequitor as that is true about literally everything. We can only compare it to its actual existing alternatives, not to some theoretical compound that we have perfect knowledge about. And given that, we know just about as much about amphetamines as we know about any drug. As far as drugs go, it is pretty much as known as a quantity as we are going to get.


Something from my original comment that everyone seemed to ignore is that I very explicitly said that you may find more known quantities as more appealing vs more experimental compounds *based on your risk tolerance*. This is a well known effect in behavioral psychology and economics -- different people have different risk tolerances. I wasn't trying to make a point about the median person, but rather saying that there are certainly risk averse people out there who would clearly prefer dealing with the risks of taking amphetamine vs the potential unknown risks of less studied compounds to either ameliorate those risks or of alternative compounds to take instead of amphetamine. *I am not one of these people*, which I think would be clear given the fact that I am here, but the relative amount of knowledge we have about these various compounds is a very important and *rational* factor to consider alongside your personal risk tolerance, and it seems to me that that is a fact that is often ignored here.",1692202623,jwg61y1,t3_15s8d62,t1_jwdoyq7,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
