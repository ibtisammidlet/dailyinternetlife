Ive seen thousands of posts on reddit saying what to take, and when, in order to avoid a nasty comedown and re-balance the brain with nutriens / vits that taking this Rx depletes in order to aid in overall brain health and recovery - per below, let me know if im missing something

Agmatine sulphate - 250mg at night
Cistanche - 200mg in morning
NAC - 600mg at night
Taurine - 1000mg in morning
Methyl B-12 sublingual - 5000mcg in morning
COQ-10 in morning

I take a full comprehensive stack otherwise 3-4x a week but have mentioned the above as ive heard they are ideal to take specifically to mitigate harm caused by amphetamines. I also have Mexidol (emoxypine) on hand which ive tried but dont really feel anything aside from maybe having a more regenerative sleep that night and morning energy the next day. My life is very hectic so its hard to me to experiment with noots and do the trial and error way of seeing how things are working given how inconsistent my day to day is. I also dont take NAC daily as ive read reports of anhedonia and i swear sometimes it makes me feel weird. Any advice here is always appreciated.
