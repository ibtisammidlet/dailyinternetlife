Hi everyone,

I've been researching the use of Polygala in traditional Chinese medicine and I'm curious about its dosage and effects. I hope someone here can share their knowledge or experiences.

1. Is Polygala taken daily as part of a long-term herbal therapy or is it possible to use it on an as-needed basis for specific purposes (in my case: depression/bad mood and social anxiety/social events)?

2. What are the potential effects or benefits of taking Polygala you experienced and at what dosages have you seen these effects manifest? 

3. Does it do anything for depression/mood, drive/energy/motivation and/or social anxiety/sociability/talkativeness?

I appreciate any insights or personal anecdotes you can share on this topic. Thank you!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Polygala Dosage and Effects - Daily or As Needed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15iey51/polygala_dosage_and_effects_daily_or_as_needed/
