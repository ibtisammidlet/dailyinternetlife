PabloAnnie,"Sorry you didn't get any response yet. These kinds of questions are better suited for e.g. r/nootropics r/NootropicsDepot r/Supplements r/herbalism as we are more oriented to scientific research / discussion, the complexity of matter is usually higher.   


But I think the lack of response comes mainly from the fact that it looks like you haven't taken much effort to find the answers to these questions. As is usual in any sub, please use the search function first and you will probably find 20 previous posts of people asking the same questions and their answers. But hey don't feel criticized, I understand the reason you didn't probably has something to do with the mood issues / anxiety you're describing.  


Hope you can get some relief! I would personally recommend bromantane, which is very popular in this sub as it increases mood, motivation while decreasing anxiety at the same time. Also many people with PTSD have found relief from it. No dependence or tolerance either and there's barely any side-effects reported as far as I'm aware. I think it's one of the few substances that I've seen to work well for such a large part of the people trying it, so it tends to be one of the first things I suggest.",1691869575,jvwu5aj,t3_15iey51,t3_15iey51,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
