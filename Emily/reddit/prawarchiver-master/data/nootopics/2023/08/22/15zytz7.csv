Efik_Pail,"Not so surprising....
It's the same problem with a lot of Russian drugs: Bromantane, Phenylpiracetam, Semax, Selank, Noopept and so on.
All of them omare very interesting componds, they are prescription meds in Russia but:
1) I think that's hard for a non European or non American lab to get to those markets.
2) it's even worse with the recent events...

It depends of so many things:, and many depend on politics or depdn of the lab making it: as an example, Sulbutiamine can be bought like vitamins in France, it's a prescription med in many countries, or it's not available. (Sulbutiamine is not very potent, that's true)

On another hand, you can't (easily and fully legally) import Tongkat Ali anymore in Europe.

Another more serious case: Tianeptine is a prescription med in France (but laws are stricts on Tianeptine, for good reasons)...not approved in US...
On the contrary, Adderall is forbidden (or at least not approved) in Russia, for example.
