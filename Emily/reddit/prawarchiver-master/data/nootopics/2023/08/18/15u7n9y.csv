Earesth99,"I take 3000 mg of lion’s mane a day - and some people actually eat a lot of mushrooms, so I think your dose was safe. 

Increasing BDNF can reduce age-related  brain shrinkage. It can also help with depression. BDNF is a problem when it’s low.

I wouldn’t expect that lions mane would noticeably down regulate our ability to produce BDNF. These supplements cause our bodies to create more BDNF, we aren’t actually taking BDNF. But I agree that 7,8 DHF is different.

While it is not toxic to humans, and research shows it can help mice, there aren’t human studies yet.  There should be some research on people in a few years, but I think it’s reasonable to be cautious.",1692589743,jx36o0h,t3_15u7n9y,t3_15u7n9y,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"There is no tolerance to BDNF, and if you want the benefits you should use a proven full-spectrum neurotrophic mixture like Cerebrolysin and Cortexin that include more than just BDNF alone, instead of random supplements with little evidence supporting their efficacy.",1692573726,jx28uhm,t3_15u7n9y,t3_15u7n9y,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
entavias,"Idk how to answer your first question but for the second one, you definitely didn’t do long term damage to your brain, you’ll be fine. Sounds like you may be allergic to lions mane though and may want to avoid it in the future. Could be worth checking to see if you’re allergic to other mushrooms as well.",1692381599,jwr2vsz,t3_15u7n9y,t3_15u7n9y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ComfortableGap7604,Forgot how long I took it for but I would cycle when I started to notice any physical changes relating back to the skin rash so if I were a teen and wanted to continue taking it before the skin rashes happened would the effects still affect me or would it be during or after the skin rashes?,1692406978,jwstzo7,t3_15u7n9y,t1_jwr2vsz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
