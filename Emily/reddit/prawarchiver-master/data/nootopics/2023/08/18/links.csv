I stopped use like 3 days ago after using for about a month. Still getting muscle spasms though.Also noticed my bowel when I go to the bathroom sometimes can be slightly gray, sometimes but also since I don’t eat as much I’m im prone to weird bowel movements. But I read it can be a sign of liver issues

Caffeine seems to exacerbate the spasms or in general stimulants do. I do also take a ton of different substances and have been so it could be the case that my liver, kidneys, or thyroid has issues now. Gonna get blood work tommorow to confirm. For the substances I use pretty regularly, I picked up a nicotine vaping habit like 2 months ago after going w the crowd at work who seem to all vape. I also use TAK, Caffeine (200-600mg depending on my tolerance,) vyvanse, agmatine,  also take a sleep supplements which contains chamomile extract, l theanine, melatonin, lemon balm extract, passion flower ext,  I also take,  valerian, cannabigerol, rosemary extract std 20% carnosic acid, I used to to take gotu kola and Bacopa as well but haven’t been recently. as for my diet, it’s pretty shit. 

As in I don’t eat as much as I should in a day. Sometimes I’ll eat one meal in a day + cereal sometimes less sometimes a little more. Since I’m kind of worried rn about possible kidney/liver issues I’ve started taking alpha lipoic acid, milk thistle, COQ-10, cordyceps sinensis, and black seed oil(nigella sativa). Also ofc lowering my “damaging” substance use until I get the blood work results. Please reccomend substances I can use to improve liver, kidney, & thyroid.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Muscle spasms.

First, id like to ask whether or not a supplement that increase BDNF is really worth it because your body is in constantly trying to make sure you stay in homeostasis so would a compound like 4’-DMA-7,8-DHF do anything

Second, Id was wondering if there would be any long lasting affects if I took Lions Mane when I was a teenager (2 years ago)? Specifically, I'm worried about the fact that Lions Mane increases BDNF and because I took it very regularly possibly the incorrect dosage as I may have converted the mg to grams incorrect and I took lions mane long enough that I had a allergic reaction with it that made my skin very itch and hurt so bad to touch. Usually I had been dosing lions mane for 3 months with 500mg and would repeat.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Questions about BDNF,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15u7n9y/questions_about_bdnf/
