Kuroneko1916,"NSI-189 mechanism doesn't work like that, you're taking Vyvanse which causes such. Titrate off the Vyvanse, and once completely off substitute magnesium, if symptoms persist look into guanfacine, and if improvement isn't satisfactory take 2mg abilify and titrate up with guanfacine. Take TUDCA and NAC for your liver.",1692503934,jwyehbw,t3_15v2f06,t3_15v2f06,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
icyeconomics42069,drop the plant shit. Or dont take all the plant shit at once thats probably whats causing the issues with your liver. Dont eat really fat meals for a few weeks and no alc and you'll be good,1700758383,kaghdj4,t3_15v2f06,t3_15v2f06,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
StevePreston__,"Quit vyvanse, take methylphenidate instead (preferably focalin, low dose). Amphetamine is neurotoxic.

3 days isn’t long when talking about NSI. The half life is up to 20 hours, and if you had a lot build up in your system over the month of use it could take multiple days just to leave your body. Plus the effects of NSI on nerves last for a while after use. It’s really likely you’ll go back to normal over the next few weeks.

If you’re worried about your liver, take TUDCA, that’s all you really need. Stop alpha lipoid acid, it could transport mercury into your brain if you have any in your body from eating fish. Muscle spasms have nothing to do with your liver.

You’re probably a hypochondriac, so just chill out. Some weird stuff if likely to happen to your body when taking barely-studied research chemicals. Doesn’t at all mean you’re screwed for life. Just chill out, take your mind off it, and it’ll go back to normal.",1692450178,jwuqtq0,t3_15v2f06,t3_15v2f06,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SpartuhnsAlt,"I ended up seeing the doctor and going to the ER cause I had a panic attack bc I thought I was having a heart attack. I had my heart, liver, thyroid, and kidneys all tested with a blood test + EKG + x ray And everything came out fine. I didn’t tell the doctor I was on NSI but I did mention my vyvanse and caffeine use",1692845415,jxi6p7g,t3_15v2f06,t1_jwyehbw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"I've seen hypochondria been mentioned in a slideshow about migraines, that hypochondriacs in past descriptions might actually have experienced that.

I guess hypochondria can have a very real physical cause.

Furthermore, aside of a bunch of diseases being undiagnosed, there might be some which could have a very prevalent connection to hypochondria. 

I think the vagal nerve, which is central to interoception and related to migraines, might have a correlation. Dysfunction can make people quite unable to get a grip on what exactly it is they are experiencing, while also causing weird symptoms that hypochondriacs might describe. 

This inability to figure such prevelant dysfunction out on their own might make them seek out attention, while being unable to actually describe/communicate it effectively enough",1696870206,k45hk3g,t3_15v2f06,t1_jwuqtq0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Kuroneko1916,"I would mention NSI-189 next time, a doctor in the US is mainly wants to make sure there's no complications. I assume it was the caffeine and Vyvanse, if you already have an anxiety disorder, I advise to stay away from caffeine in general. Fortunately those test seem fine. I recommend maybe trying some L-theanine to help with symptoms of anxiety, but also it has it's limitations in effectiveness.",1693004311,jxrcrrq,t3_15v2f06,t1_jxi6p7g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
