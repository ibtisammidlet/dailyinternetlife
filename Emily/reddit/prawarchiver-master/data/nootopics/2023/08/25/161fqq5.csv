,"I'm very very curious, because I study the cognitive neurogenetics of high intelligence.

I have no found nootropics that actually increase IQ because of an actual enhancement in cognitive capacity. Is it legit?

I think that if we understand the complex and dynamic interactions of plasma sex hormones and most effective neuromodulators and neuroendocrine system, like dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine and histamines, we can create an accurate model of the brain, genes and cognition for cognitive enhancement.

Are you planning to report results of actual improvement with a  psychological test like WAIS-IV or something?

I'm curious about TAK-653 because it seems very selective and with some of the specific effects I'm searching, like some studies about IQ and relation to recognition memory and working memory.

Unfortunately, I can't find an actual scientist that is doing research with this.",1693086099,jxvqvrg,t3_161fqq5,t1_jxvlbbu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Nope. Is it like TAK-653?

The point is to find nootropics that actually increase cognitive ability, not only IQ.

I have already seen something. Seems not secure.",1693091021,jxw1s7p,t3_161fqq5,t1_jxvywbs,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
