They offer PP Hydrazide pwd, min 5g but at a very fair price. First I check the website to see method of payment, if they really ships from eu, prices, tracking ecc. Then I look a bit around looking on scamadviser, whois ad last also on trustpilot and well, what I find I could say is not good, neither bad. There are not much ""spoilers"" about this shop but I must say I find both shops that really and clearly was like hearing someone tell me ""Be very careful, and JUST PASS OVER IT!"". Or some pretty well-know sources, even in EU now are few, that have lots of reviews anywhere, but in this ""many"" what it pop up immediately, like a ""mind rush"" was that I was able to notice that those many ""mix"" reviews/opinion were extreme from both side or who reports a bad experience tells that could say quality of stuff was not bad indeed...they got 100% placebo effect, somewhat can they can not at all relate to anything if not surrealistic/metaphoric stuff li ""some grams of unflavored sugar on powder/caps/pills form. Who got great feetback also keep for sure an eye on the review section and often when some unsatisfied costumer left his feedback they reply with what I see like ""smart provocations, often that even not quote what unsatisfied costumer reports, instead the seems to what a bit ""mind screw"" them to lead them in their answer eg show, admit was first time they buy and try nootrops, or that they know very few or got just a big confusion/mess 'cause they good a poor experience like have always find and buy low or bad quality stuff or even they buy stuff reporting their experience that clearly eg they were so idiot to report eg what is one of the commons bad or good experience with Adrafinil but clearly they where talking, always getting and reading the many and most bad or got experience/reports with with Piracentam (again a very very messy mate, not reliable, at the point that he talk about Piracentam clearly, he was talking about Adrafinil).   


I see this kind of behavior as a tricky, fooly, sneaky, furthermore 'cause the ""unofficial seller attorney"" (lol, like to call them so, not i'm say the were...or may....well...who knows....) never put an insult, or even show to be bother in any way because they left a bad feedback. But yeaah ""a smart tricky"" asshole that without a doubt, at least for me, has got as ""his goal""/purpose to lead people that report bad experience to show that they also has a very poor experience/knowledge in the field, if not at all...so...how people could (or couldn't) get into account a review by some dude of this kind? Yeah, not afraid or problems to at least tell you an online shop name for which I found and I can still find this precise situation anywhere (or in the most) forum/blogs that let readers to left under every post their own comment, or on websites precisely aimed to collect feedback and reviews YOTTABOOST!

SORRY FOR MY LONG POST, BACK IN TOPIC WITH MY LAST AND KIND REQUEST: so anyone here have yet got and experience (aka buy) from RECMALABS, if not their phenylpiracetam powder, or,  at least any other of their nootrops? (i'm not interested at all in sarms, so thank you anyway, but if you can report feedback about their sarms sorry but i don't care at all)

Of course you can also report an experience/feedback from one of your friends is, at least from someone that you find most of time if not always really trustworthy (aka once or more time, rely on his/her feedback you got to buy from the source and you could just confirm what was the feedback of this honest dude)

Or simply, knowing that here there are people that for their experience, or as I say, because they can get touch in private, both in ""real life"" both online with people that in EU shows since years to really be ""into nootropic"" field, as graduated or very, very keen researches aka even they hear/read about a new name, could be a new nootropic, a potential supplement that for they ""documented"" mechanism of action on the chemistry of out mind and body that this supps can ""tweak"" like nootrops used to do well, may they should go on to sell it as supplement or may it will start also to be sell as a nootropic do not really matter: this is just business matter. And if is a good deal/stuff for those keen nootropic mates...well imo (i'm at most ""in"" and interested for nootropic or ""suppsnotrops"" let me call it so, lol) that enhance memory, mood, endurance, focus. Even, I must say that eg Cyclazodone or his brother Methyl-Cyclazodone, for their ""chemistry"" will be more right if, like I see someone yet used to do when talking about those stims, that brief: even several nootropics online shop, and I see that at least 2 of these shops are really reliable under any aspect\*\* those two nootropics (and some few others) are in someway aka related to what are called RC compounds: not that's bad, but of course that need people are interested at first sight level ""ok, i have just find what will be my next sample to get a try"" TO BE EVENMORE CAREFUL with this stuff.Thank you so much in advance to anyone will read this post and may also reply.

Stay Safe!

\*\* (only complaint I found in the many many many reviews from people that buy from them, and there are some friends if mine that buy from them and then we split in half the total amount of the order, benefit was, split 50/50 the shipping price and got a little discount that that was offered to anyone that would buy from ""x"" grams to the max qty they got in stock.  100% satisfied me, very high quality, I feel the effects of this nootrpic, and be I can could it an ""old classic"" one, that in some country it is even sold, branded by pharma inc. as ""pharma sold under medical prescription"". My purpose is not to get emphasis even more care that this nootropic reach the pharma grade but that because it shows even to have pharma benefits/effect, you still find online nootropic shops, even online from several years, that have in stock and sold this nootropic but 99% of reviews of people buy it from them, and are many, got it in a so bad quality till they even dub that few effects they got first dosage that they swallow just some hour after the stuff was deliver to the f curse should just be matters of momentary awesomeness excitement, because all other times they take it, even in greater dosage, till they reach the last few grams left of this order/stuff they got zero benefits/effects from it)",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Phenylpiracetam Hydrazide from an EU source at a fair price, imo too much fair, any tips/info about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15pnzez/phenylpiracetam_hydrazide_from_an_eu_source_at_a/
