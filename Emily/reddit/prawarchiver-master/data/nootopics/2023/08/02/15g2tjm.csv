Fine-Tale2468,"I take it. Doesn't need to be taken sublingual tho. I take it in the morning on an empty stomach. I use the liquid version. I do hold it in my mouth for a few minutes and then swallow . Days that I've done that versus just swallowing it without holding it sublingual it has worked the same. 

TAK-653 works Wonders for me! 

The molecule has to be small enough to pass the bbb and I don't think it's doable IN. Although I might be wrong. 

I stack it with IN Bromantane. I'm 2.5 weeks in. Last weekend I tackled a year's worth of laundry and organized my house. I have CFS from severe long Covid that caused major neuro issues. I'm about 90% back to normal but struggle with organization and avoidance behavior and occasional PEM (post exertional malaise) episodes. 

This has really worked wonders for me.",1691316045,jv0g4r8,t3_15g2tjm,t3_15g2tjm,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,There’s a few people on the discord that have used the powdered form IN and they claim it’s far more efficacious,1690975521,jugvj1h,t3_15g2tjm,t3_15g2tjm,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
SaltYogurtcloset124,I felt an effect by just adding it to water. I have no idea how bioavailable it was but I felt something.,1690966444,jugiyo9,t3_15g2tjm,t3_15g2tjm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Thanks for your reply! Yes, TAK is a great compound. I've been experimenting with the powder SL and IN since this post, but my first guess would be that there are no massive differences between (equal dose) IN and SL with respect to oral. Which is a shame, because 8mg TAK a day is becoming really expensive :(

Bromantane on the other hand the difference between equal dose oral and SL/IN is clearly noticable.",1691396269,jv4vk9q,t3_15g2tjm,t1_jv0g4r8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
kinderstander,Where do you find the powdered form? I’d appreciate a DM if you know the source- thx!,1690984536,juhdw7j,t3_15g2tjm,t1_jugvj1h,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fine-Tale2468,Same! I add a dropper full into a dixie cup and add a dash of water. I hold it in my mouth for a little while and then swallow. On days when I don't have time to hold it in my mouth sublingual — I just swallowed it on an empty stomach and it works wonders that way. IN is unnecessary for me.,1691316338,jv0ghnf,t3_15g2tjm,t1_jugiyo9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fine-Tale2468,"Interesting. I do one to two sprays IN with Bromantane and have to take additional Bromantane SL for extended benefit. The IN seems to wake me up. The SL keeps me even tempered. 

Doing Bromantane that way means I only need 3mg TAK-653 daily. My TAK is the liquid from E-very Ch-em.",1691484988,jv9yigj,t3_15g2tjm,t1_jv4vk9q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
