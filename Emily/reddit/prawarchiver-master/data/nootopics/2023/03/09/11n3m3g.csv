WouldYouCalmDown,"CDNF yes, but CNTF no because it isn't localized in the striatum. As well, CDNF has been shown to be synergistic with GDNF in its effects as talked about in this [pubmed study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28303260/).   The findings of CDNF are still fairly new and being researched though there have been human trials of it with good results thus far. Here are a few articles that compound on each other with a quote from the first one to sum it up (Bottom link is about the human trials).

WouldYouCalmDown,"This comment got much longer than I expected. For that I apologize, but bare with me. It's worth it for furthering the community's knowledge and progress that we all want.

While I can understand why you feel that's an issue, the potential concern is that there aren't really any adequate tests on healthy subjects since it's still fairly new in research. Parts of my comment below explain why healthy is subjective and isn't necessarily import when it comes to humans. The other issue being that while it has been shown to be detectable up to 72 hours after administration, they can't be conclusive about its excretion. CDNF doesn't have a know receptor, and while studies show that it internalizes into neurons, its done in a manner that isn't fully understood yet.\
So even when it can no longer be detected in endosomes or lysosomes, it still has long lasting effects with or without  current illness or induced bran damage happening as shown in the quote below.\
[Quote from this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5318544/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20relatively,to%20be%20studied)

>Despite its relatively short persistence in rat brain, in the rat model of PD a single injection of rhCDNF, given 4 weeks after 6-OHDA administration, had a remarkably enduring effect at the level of behavior, lasting for up to 8 weeks (Lindholm et al., 2007). This has been interpreted as CDNF having a neurorestorative activity similar to GDNF and Neurturin, for instance. Indeed, the long-term changes of neural function following a rather short exposure to rhCDNF imply that this exposure leads to more permanent changes through its influence on gene expression, perhaps similarly to the way neurotrophic factors like GDNF influence gene expression through signal transduction cascades. How CDNF triggers the long-lasting survival-promoting effects in the brain remains to be studied.

&#x200B;

And I in no way am meaning to discredit GDNF or make it out to be faulty compared to CDNF, but the below quote shows that while GDNF protects neurons, it has no restorative effect on dopamine neurons unless it's active while they are being damaged. So while GDNF is great for many things and always has a clear space for use, CDNF shows potential to be a better option when talking about the striatum.\
[Quote from this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0049-0#:~:text=In%20the%20group%20of%20animals%20where%20GDNF%20expression%20was%20on%20during%20degeneration%2C%20neurons%20were%20rescued%20and%20there%20was%20a%20reversal%20of%20motor%20deficits)

>In the group of animals where GDNF expression was on during degeneration, neurons were rescued and there was a reversal of motor deficits. Turning GDNF expression on after the nigrostriatal system was lesioned did not rescue neurons or reverse motor deficits. In fact, these animals were indistinguishable from the control groups.

&#x200B;

All I'm saying is you shouldn't push CDNF aside so quickly. Very much worth looking into and could be the next best thing for helping people recover from stims or unknown dopamine damage, and/or reduce the loss of dopamine neurons when taken with stims. [This study](https://www.medsci.org/v14p0340.pdf) I read a while back showed that when taken with Methamphetamine, only an 11% loss was observed after cessation vs 47% in those given Meth alone.\
It's shown to be better at repair and protection in the striatum than GDNF as shown below. (From a PD multi study).\
[Quote from this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628563/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%202%2Dweek%20chronic%20intrastriatal%20infusion%20of%20CDNF%20via%20implanted%20osmotic%20minipumps%20gradually%20normalized%20the%20motor%20behavior%20of%20the%206%2DOHDA%20lesioned%20rats%2C%20with%20prominent%20regeneration%20and%20sprouting%20of%20TH%2Dpositive%20fibers%20in%20the%20nigrostriatal%20pathway%20while%20GDNF%20in%20comparison%20had%20only%20modest%20effects)

>Similarly, 2-week chronic intrastriatal infusion of CDNF via implanted osmotic minipumps gradually normalized the motor behavior of the 6-OHDA lesioned rats, with prominent regeneration and sprouting of TH-positive fibers in the nigrostriatal pathway while GDNF in comparison had only modest effects. Notably, CDNF showed a significantly larger volume of diffusion in this study compared with GDNF.

&#x200B;

In the end, most people that are interested in striatal dopamine neurogenesis are usually people that feel as though they have done some damage to it or want something to reduce potential damage/tolerance from things that increase it. Beyond that, wouldn't you say NTF's like GDNF and CDNF aren't things that you have to worry about having opposing side effects while using them? So sensibly you could taken them daily, or weekly, to help with dopamine as opposed to needing them to work for extended periods of time.",1678569219,jbuncpw,t3_11n3m3g,t1_jbp0klu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
