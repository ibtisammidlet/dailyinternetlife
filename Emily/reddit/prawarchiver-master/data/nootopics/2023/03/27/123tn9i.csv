jdt8983,Heard.  It's not the best and it leaves bruises.  I don't want to hook up with some chick and her ask if I'm on the juice.  So trying to play with placement.  Overall though it depends on what ails ya. I think to see real lifting results it's gotta be that CJC combo...but I've read it can fuck with mood....but to get more cut and help with joint issues it's Ipam...but Ipam can help a little with mood.

sirsadalot,"There's a difference between it being carcinogenic and it proliferating existing cancer. In the case of uridine and due to what I posted it appears carcinogenic only reaching relevance at high amounts. 

That isn't the main reason not to use it though, mainly the sedating nature and acute antidopaminergic/gabaergic effects and questionable neurotrophic actions",1699196887,k7xnpn0,t3_123tn9i,t1_k7w8lx2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
