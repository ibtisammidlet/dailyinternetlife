Since many of these compounds are relatively unheard of, I figured I'd make this guide to delve into the literature, novel facts and other effects of the compounds.

To keep things simple, I've also summarized my findings towards the end of the post. The compounds I discuss here are Neboglamine, TAK-653, Roxadustat, Pitolisant, Istradefylline, Tropisetron and Guanfacine. Enjoy.

# Neboglamine (available now)

I've known of Neboglamine for almost two years, but due to the success of everychem I was finally able to fund a synthesis for it. As a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA glycine site, it produces specific advantages over glutamate modulators and D-Serine alike, of which it more closely resembles in the brain.

Based on the literature, it can be expected that Neboglamine produces antidepressant,[^(\[1\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04217)[^(\[9\])](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061116/http://www.xytis.com/Pipeline/xy2401.html)[^(\[10\])](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/12/9/1275/667286?login=false)[^(\[17\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278496/) nootropic,[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554623/)[^(\[5\])](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/7691/text/)[^(\[6\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-7158.1996.tb03938.x#)[^(\[7\])](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1527-3458.1997.tb00326.x) anxiolytic,[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554623/)[^(\[10\])](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/12/9/1275/667286?login=false) anti-Parkinson's,[^(\[11\])](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/apsy/2014/859735/) and anti-Schizophrenia effects.[^(\[12\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11586650-000000000-00000) Interestingly, it could produce an anti-hedonistic effect as well, including drug addiction,[^(\[9\])](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061116/http://www.xytis.com/Pipeline/xy2401.html)[^(\[13\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19595781/)[^(\[14\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4538350/)[^(\[15\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27239019/) diet preference[^(\[16\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/7/1081) and potentially aberrant sexuality.[^(\[18\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2196133/)

The brain naturally produces a neurotransmitter named D-Serine, and Neboglamine potentiates its binding co-agonist site, specifically. This unique mechanism makes Neboglamine superior to D-Serine for a number of reasons:

**Neuroplasticity and depression:** D-Serine produces an antidepressant-like effect, which is mediated by increased glutamate release, similarly to Ketamine (although increased glycine site activity can also reverse cognitive deficits induced by Ketamine[^(\[26\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22113087/)).[^(\[1\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04217) This glutamate binds to AMPA, which causes a release of BDNF and thus mTOR. Since D-Serine is a weak antagonist at AMPA,[^(\[2\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17632590/) Neboglamine potentiates AMPA activity more than D-Serine, in addition to being stronger in general. It looks like before Xytis (the pharmaceutical company licensing Neboglamine) went under, antidepressant effects were confirmed in people.[^(\[9\])](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061116/http://www.xytis.com/Pipeline/xy2401.html) D-Serine has also been noted to restore mate seeking in depressed rats.[^(\[17\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278496/)

**Novelty of its mechanism:** It's well known that AMPA PAMs produce greater procognitive effects when they're more selective to the allosteric site, as shown with TAK-653.[^(\[3\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93888-0) So by this logic, Neboglamine's nootropic effects could be greater than that of D-Serine, despite D-Serine alone being shown to improve some markers of fluid intelligence in healthy subjects.[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554623/)[^(\[5\])](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/7691/text/) In preclinical studies, Neboglamine improved learning acquisition in otherwise healthy rodents, which is consistent with these findings.[^(\[6\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-7158.1996.tb03938.x#)[^(\[7\])](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1527-3458.1997.tb00326.x)

**Improved safety:** D-Serine produces oxidative stress, which wouldn't occur with Neboglamine.[^(\[8\])](https://sci-hub.yncjkj.com/10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.036) It passed phase 1 clinical trials with safety and tolerability being described as ""excellent"",[^(\[9\])](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006061116/http://www.xytis.com/Pipeline/xy2401.html) and its safety is further bolstered by the abnormally high LD50 in rodents[^(\[6\])](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-7158.1996.tb03938.x#) and high predicted safety in ADMETLab 2.0.

# TAK-653 (available)

TAK-653 was my first custom synthesis project, which I funded after seeing so much data in support of AMPA PAMs. Initially I was looking into the CX- class ampakines, but then I decided to go with TAK due to cost efficiency and efficiency. TAK-653 is the most selective AMPA PAM, and it has passed phase 1 clinical trials, where it was deemed safe and well tolerated.

TAK-653 has been proven to enhance executive function in healthy people,[^(\[19\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509332/) which is consistent with other AMPA PAMs.[^(\[21\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/826948/)[^(\[22\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/785952/)[^(\[23\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10555876/)[^(\[24\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001448869796581X?via%3Dihub)[^(\[25\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp20176) By acting strictly as an AMPA PAM, with no agonist affinity, it is more procognitive than other AMPA PAMs.[^(\[3\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93888-0) Additionally, AMPA is not downregulated by this class of AMPA PAMs, so withdrawal is unlikely.[^(\[70\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461786/)

**NooTopics cognitive testing results:** Those who have agreed to take online mensa IQ tests before and after, reported the following scores (in points gained): 0 (non-responder), 3 (130+ baseline IQ), 6 (115+), 7 (115+), 7+ (130+), 7+ (130+), 15 (115+). Improvements have also been shown in a variety of cognitive tests, including WAIS-IV auditory digit span, WAIS-IV symbol search, and human benchmark visual memory tests.

**Neuroplasticity and TAK-653:** TAK-653 is being developed as an antidepressant because as explained earlier, increased AMPA activation mediates the antidepressant effects of Ketamine (and like D-Serine, AMPA PAMs have also been shown to reverse Ketamine-induced cognitive deficits[^(\[25\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp20176)). TAK-653 reduces depression in preclinical studies,[^(\[20\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130572100188X) but it is unclear as of presently if the same will occur in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. AMPA PAMs have also been demonstrated to reverse social deficits in animal models of autism.[^(\[27\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300529/)

In short, TAK-653 is one of the most effective nootropics created to date in terms of proof and quantitative results. By improving memory formation at its most basic level, TAK-653 and Neboglamine are two of the most promising candidates for cognition enhancement.

# Roxadustat (available, stock temporary)

A while ago I read about Erythropoietin (EPO)'s ability to enhance cognition in healthy people. It would appear that high but not low dose injections had this effect, improving verbal fluency,[^(\[28\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17828390/) possibly through its beneficial effect on neural response during memory retrieval.[^(\[29\])](https://sci-hub.se/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5013-06.2007) When given to infants with low birth weight, they scored significantly better on IQ tests about 10-13 years later.[^(\[30\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20437563/)

**Mechanism of action:** Roxadustat acts as a HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, which activates the HIF-1 pathway to increase EPO synthesis, both in the brain in liver. In a preclinical model of depression, Roxadustat improved depression, increased neurogenesis and improved cognition.[^(\[31\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31820273/) Additionally,  FG-4497, a close relative to Roxadustat (FG-4592), improved memory in normal, healthy mice.[^(\[32\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19900484/) Noopept is also a HIF-proplyl hydroxylase inhibitor,[^(\[36\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33119829/) but due to having agonist affinity at AMPA, it will not be listed to everychem.[^(\[37\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476267/)

Since high dose EPO injections are too expensive for anyone to realistically afford, targeting EPO synthesis makes more sense. Roxadustat appears to also increase EPO producing cells in the kidney, which might have a long term positive effect on cognition.[^(\[84\])](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/4/753)

**Safety:** Despite [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxadustat) summary, in the biggest analysis of controlled clinical trials (2781 patients) concluded Roxadustat's side effects were comparable to placebo.[^(\[33\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33568383/)  However, the company came forward and admitted a scientist skewed the results in their favor before admitting the data. It's not sure why they did this, as the risk before editing was still very low.[^(\[38\])](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/06/2205376/33525/en/FibroGen-Provides-Additional-Information-on-Roxadustat.html) The individual responsible was fired and testing continued, leading to two meta-analyses containing 997 patients[^(\[34\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33966423/) and 4764 patients,[^(\[39\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36466382/) wherein the side effects were still no different from placebo. Some concerns were raised about the potential for Roxadustat to increase cancerous growth (downstream of VEGF promotion), but this was debunked.[^(\[35\])](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581817737232) Overall it would appear Roxadustat doesn't have adverse effects, but it's possible given EPO's link to higher blood pressure.

**Athletic doping:** Roxadustat is banned from sports. This is because erythropoietin is known to enhance athletic performance.[^(\[40\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213874/)

**Pharmacokinetics:** Plasma protein binding of Roxadustat is high,[^(\[41\])](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-021-01095-x) and although it was designed to be used orally, other routes of administration, such as intranasal, might be more efficient for achieving cognitive benefits.

# Pitolisant (change of plans, likely not being listed ever)

Pitolisant is a wakefulness promoter that is prescribed to narcoleptics to prevent drowsiness and cataplexy. It is a selective H3 histamine receptor inverse agonist, which as a mechanism displays nootropic effects in healthy people,[^(\[50\])](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.13885) seemingly improving memory of forgotten objects.[^(\[51\])](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.11.009) H3 density is also inversely correlated with working memory in humans.[^(\[43\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900481/)

In addition to nootropic effects, H3 inverse agonists and/ or antagonists are thought to potentially be of use in treating Alzheimer's, ADHD, Schizophrenia, Epilepsy, Narcolepsy and drug abuse.[^(\[44\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478588/) H3 antagonists have been shown to restore cognition in the presence of stress in preclinical studies,[^(\[45\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23975035/) and can act as atypical antipsychotics.[^(\[46\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20021346/) One dual inhibitor of H3 and acetylcholinesterase has been shown to reverse abnormality and oxidative stress in a valproic acid model of autism.[^(\[49\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32503208/)

**Mechanism of action:** As an inverse agonist, Pitolisant releases histamine in the brain, which would not be possible with an antagonist.[^(\[42\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3111674/) It also selectively releases dopamine into the prefrontal cortex, and acetylcholine into the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.[^(\[42\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3111674/) It would also seem that the H3 receptor, when bound, can impair dopamine synthesis.[^(\[47\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390815300125) Pitolisant modulates the excitation and inhibition in the perirhinal cortex, which is potentially how it exerts procognitive and antiepileptic effects simultaneously.[^(\[48\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11032-y)

**Safety:** It would appear that Pitolisant is otherwise safe, with the exception of potentially causing insomnia.[^(\[52\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33667687/) Comparatively, Pitolisant was less prone to side effects than Modafinil[^(\[53\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24107292/) and more effective at treating cataplexy.[^(\[54\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35774905/) That being said, it is a weak hERG blocker, and it's advised not to use Pitolisant with other hERG blockers.[^(\[86\])](https://n.neurology.org/content/96/15_supplement/1472.abstract)

# Istradefylline (available)

**Mechanism of action:** Caffeine is an adenosine A2a and A1 antagonist. It is one of the oldest and most widely used drugs in the world, considered by many to be a necessity in their daily lives. However, one of the most frequent complaints is tolerance, and selective A2a antagonists have been shown not to upregulate A2a or build tolerance to dopamine promoting effects.[^(\[55\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11040341/) Istradefylline is a long lasting A2a antagonist that is prescribed for Parkinson's disease. The neuroprotective[^(\[56\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18404497/) and neuroplastic[^(\[57\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182030/) effects of caffeine are thought to be mediated primarily through A2a antagonism, with A1 being a less desirable target. It has been suggested that coffee, and by extension caffeine inhibit PDEs which are involved in neurotransmission, however it would appear that the PDE inhibition from coffee is not mediated by caffeine.[^(\[58\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28443667/) Therefore the studies conducted using caffeine as a cognition enhancing compound[^(\[59\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11057520/)[^(\[60\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14572506/)[^(\[61\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15678363/)[^(\[85\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7870897/)^(\[etc\]) can be directly applied to selective A2a antagonists such as Istradefylline, and given the potential downsides to A1 antagonism to cognition, Istradefylline may be a stronger nootropic.

**Safety:** In a meta-analysis, Istradefylline did not differ from placebo in terms of adverse effects.[^(\[62\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35149201/) The long half life of 72 hours does not appear to impair sleep quality, yet still managed to improve patients' daytime sleepiness.[^(\[63\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28870576/)

**Other:** Istradefylline displayed antidepressant effects in a rodent study,[^(\[64\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24201052/) and significantly reduces the withdrawal of levodopa in Parkinson's patients.[^(\[65\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9329678/)

# Tropisetron (available)

As discussed previously in older posts, Tropisetron is a nootropic and anxiolytic compound with ties to improving cognition in healthy people due to acting as an α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist. Using GTS-21 as a reference model for this, it has potential to increase working memory, episodic memory and attention span.[^(\[66\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028) In terms of side effects and efficiency in clinical trials, Tropisetron shows a clear benefit, and the majority of nicotine's procognitive effects can be replicated with α7 partial agonists, without any addiction and greater anti-inflammatory benefits.[^(\[67\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uw3y4v/tropisetron_is_one_of_the_best_nootropics_v2/) In addition to having stronger anti-inflammatory effects, partial agonists at α7 have an advantage over full agonists (like nicotine) because they simultaneously activate the receptor while preventing excitotoxicity caused by overactivation.[^(\[67\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uw3y4v/tropisetron_is_one_of_the_best_nootropics_v2/)

Tropisetron has been given clinical trials for Schizophrenia, OCD, generalized anxiety and fibromyalgia (as an analgesic), where it showed generalized improvement for each.[^(\[67\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uw3y4v/tropisetron_is_one_of_the_best_nootropics_v2/) However, as a -setron, it is most commonly recognized for its ability to treat nausea.

**More on Tropisetron:** In primates, it is shown that Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, significantly potentiates the working memory enhancement of Tropisetron, likely by increasing acetylcholine that would bind to α7.[^(\[68\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.02.025) And interestingly, Tropisetron improved memory in an Alzheimer's model in mice better than both Donepezil and Memantine.[^(\[68\])](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14728222.2014.983901) Working memory benefits downstream of α7 are potentially mediated by D-Serine release,[^(\[71\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455333/) further substantiating the role of Neboglamine as a nootropic. Tropisetron is also a partial agonist of 5-HT4, which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.[^(\[69\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11218067/)

**Safety:** The safety of Tropisetron is high in clinical trials, but it may slow down the gastrointestinal tract, with a low but present risk of constipation, especially at doses higher than 5mg.[^(\[67\])](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uw3y4v/tropisetron_is_one_of_the_best_nootropics_v2/)

# Guanfacine (available now)

Guanfacine is used for the treatment of ADHD and high blood pressure. That being said, Guanfacine has been shown to increase working memory in healthy subjects in two separate studies[^(\[72\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395310)[^(\[73\])](https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Abstract/2008/09000/The_Effects_of_Guanfacine_on_Working_Memory.1.aspx) and reading comprehension,[^(\[75\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9885792/) but there are outliers as well.[^(\[74\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078088/)[^(\[76\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35963558/)

Also of importance is the apparent anxiolytic effect of Guanfacine, where it improved global outcome in generalized and social anxiety disorders.[^(\[77\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695796/) It was also trialed in cocaine-dependent users, where they experienced improved verbal fluency, less anxiety, better inhibitory control and attentional task switching, albeit with no improvement to working or peripheral memory.[^(\[78\])](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881114562464)

**Mechanism of action:** Guanfacine is an α2A adrenoceptor agonist. In the prefrontal cortex, this strengthens connectivity and therefore activity (hence the procognitive effects in healthy subjects and in ADHD).[^(\[79\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33075480/) In the sympathetic nervous system, Guanfacine reduces tone and response to noradrenaline cues, thus resulting in lower blood pressure.[^(\[80\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1983.tb00311.x) It would also appear that Guanfacine administration increases human growth hormone secretion.[^(\[82\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/030645309390054O)

**Safety:** Guanfacine is decades old, and has been prescribed since 1986. It is fairly tolerated, and safe in a proper dose range. That being said, slight sedation and dryness of mouth are potential side effects of the compound.[^(\[81\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430125/) These among rarer side effects mainly occur after a dose of >2mg, and post-cessation hypertension is recorded only in a small minority of users with a dose above 4mg.[^(\[81\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430125/) Given this, 0.5-1mg would appear to be the most logical dose. Tolerance isn't observed, and recorded hypertension after discontinuation is moderate at best.[^(\[80\])](https://sci-hub.se/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2125.1983.tb00311.x)[^(\[81\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430125/) The possibility of causing valvulopathy has been considered with Guanfacine, since it is a 5-HT2B agonist, but in its long history of use there hasn't been any evidence of this occurring.[^(\[83\])](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/auspar-guanfacine-180503.pdf)

# Short descriptions:

**Neboglamine summary,** NMDA Glycine Site positive allosteric modulator (PAM):

Key takeaways:

* As a glutamate modulator, Neboglamine has one of the most direct routes to the fabric of how memories are formed. Due to the specificity of it, however, it produces desirable effects.
* Its antidepressant activity has already been confirmed in people because it's AMPA-ergic, and due to behaving similarly to D-Serine, it has strongly predicted nootropic effects in healthy people.[^(\[4\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554623/)[^(\[5\])](https://www.oncotarget.com/article/7691/text/)
* It's likely effective for the treatment of PTSD, Addiction and Schizophrenia, but these studies have not been conducted yet. It may also have potential in the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Parkinson's disease.

**TAK-653 summary,** AMPA PAM:

Key takeaways:

* TAK-653 is another glutamate modulator, except it is one of the most selective AMPA PAMs. This gives it improved safety and cognition enhancement, making it superior to other AMPA PAMs, of which there are many in the nootropics world.
* Not only is the cognition enhancing profile already confirmed in people using the compound,[^(\[19\])](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9509332/) this was to be expected since it has already been shown to occur with older AMPA PAMs.[^(\[21\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/826948/)[^(\[22\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/785952/)[^(\[23\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10555876/)[^(\[24\])](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001448869796581X?via%3Dihub)[^(\[25\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp20176)
* It is being designed as a treatment for depression (but not yet proven), since enhanced AMPA activity is one of the leading theories with depression, based on Ketamine. It's also a potential candidate for treatment of autism, schizophrenia and other cognitive disorders

**Roxadustat summary,** HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor\*\*:\*\*

Key takeaways:

* Roxadustat enhances the synthesis of Erythropoietin (EPO), which has been shown to have nootropic effects when administered to healthy people.[^(\[28\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17828390/)[^(\[29\])](https://sci-hub.se/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5013-06.2007) But it's also most likely an athletic performance enhancer, which is why it has been banned from professional sports.
* Despite being an approved treatment for Anemia in some countries, the increased hippocampal outgrowth with EPO administration makes it a possible candidate in the treatment of depression.

**Pitolisant summary,** H3 histamine receptor inverse agonist:

Key takeaways:

* Pitolisant is a wakefulness promoter, and an approved treatment for Narcolepsy. It has a cognition enhancing profile downstream of inverse agonism of H3 which, unlike antagonism, can produce greater effects.
* While Pitolisant itself has not been tested in healthy people for cognition enhancement, other H3 inhibitors have,[^(\[50\])](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.13885)[^(\[51\])](https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.11.009) with promising results. The density of H3 in the brain also negatively correlates with working memory in people.[^(\[43\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29900481/)
* Likely treatment for Epilepsy. Also a potential candidate for Alzheimer's, ADHD, Schizophrenia and drug abuse, but it's not clear as of yet if it will be efficient for those disorders.

**Istradefylline summary,** Adenosine A2a antagonist:

Key takeaways:

* Istradefylline is an A2a antagonist, similarly to caffeine, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to produce nootropic effects in healthy people.[^(\[59\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11057520/)[^(\[60\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14572506/)[^(\[61\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15678363/)[^(\[85\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7870897/)^(\[etc\]) Lacking the cardiovascular side effects, and potential for dependence, Istradefylline has marked advantages over caffeine.
* It's an approved treatment for Parkinson's in some countries, and a potential treatment for depression.

**Tropisetron summary,** 5-HT3 antagonist and α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist:

* Tropisetron's likelihood of being a nootropic is based on GTS-21, another α7 partial agonist,[^(\[66\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028) although full agonists of α7 also have demonstrated efficacy in healthy people as cognitive enhancers, such as in the case of CDP-Choline. Partial agonism, due to limiting possible overactivation, however, gives it dual action as a neuroprotective agent, and as a 5-HT3 antagonist it prevents nausea from α7 activation, as well as helping to treat other disorders.
* Tropisetron is an approved treatment for nausea and fibromyalgia pain (in some countries), confirmed to reduce anxiety in GAD, the symptoms of Schizophrenia (possibly because α7 releases D-Serine), and improved Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It's also a likely treatment for Alzheimer's and drug abuse

**Guanfacine summary,** adrenoceptor α2A agonist and 5-HT2B agonist:

* Guanfacine has multiple studies in healthy people showing it enhancing cognition,[^(\[72\])](https://www.nature.com/articles/1395310)[^(\[73\])](https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Abstract/2008/09000/The_Effects_of_Guanfacine_on_Working_Memory.1.aspx)[^(\[75\])](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9885792/) and it also can reduce blood pressure.
* It's an approved treatment for ADHD and high blood pressure (in some countries), is confirmed to reduce anxiety, and it's a likely treatment for drug abuse.
