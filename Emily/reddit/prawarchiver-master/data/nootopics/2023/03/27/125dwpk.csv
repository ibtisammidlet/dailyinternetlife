PabloAnnie,"Everychem's nasal spray is experienced to be at least twice as potent as sublingual dosing and is concentrated at 9mg per spray, which would equal at least 18mg sublingual. Most users use 2 - 3 sprays per day, though you can go higher which increases it's anxiolytic effects. It's solvent is pure caprylic acid, which makes for a handy bacteriostatic solution. Many thanks to Sirsadalot for figuring out what the best solvent is!

 Can I ask what NM stands for?",1680142089,je81x8c,t3_125dwpk,t3_125dwpk,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

FullSquirrel88,You have a source for 100% caprylic acid? Amazon just yields results of MCT oil which I'm assuming contains other things.,1680189740,jea78ld,t3_125dwpk,t1_je41l2o,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
FullSquirrel88,"Newmind, actually. I was also going to request that someone point me in the right direction for pure caprylic acid. I perused Amazon but it's all MCT oil which I'm assuming contains other things.",1680145920,je89t2g,t3_125dwpk,t1_je81x8c,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
