I think this would be cool for me to try.",1686061756,jn4guq9,t3_126zob7,t3_126zob7,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"Thanks for sharing this. 4 mg was too much for me, too, although in a different way. I didnâ€™t get anxious, but I got pressure in the head.",1680267641,jeehp6o,t3_126zob7,t3_126zob7,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrSteveCruel,"I'm gonna be trying TAK (on my lab rats) soon, and I was wondering: how did you administer it (to your lab rats)? Liquid directly in (the lab rat's) mouth? Mixed in a drink (for the lab rats)?   


Thanks!",1680718286,jf2yjs1,t3_126zob7,t3_126zob7,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,you'll also get used to it over a few weeks. I didn't like Tak at first for many of the reasons you described. I finally settled on 1.5mgs and it worked great. Now I take 2mgs which is the suggested dose and I love it. It takes time to adapt to it.,1680718808,jf2zxbn,t3_126zob7,t3_126zob7,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

iovw,"Almost 2 more weeks on tak 1.5 mg and I'm feeling fine. I'm going to do one more week then stop and see if I notice any difference. 

I started meditating - was it tak which helped spur this? My heart rate variability is increasing and my sleep is getting better. 

Will update in 2 weeks.",1681295303,jfy2vtp,t3_126zob7,t3_126zob7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

iovw,"No on both accounts. I'm normally sensitive to sleep changes but I have been sleeping well. I monitor my HRV at night and it isn't affected by the tak 653 supplementation.

iovw,I continued and noticed memory improvement with recall and short term. The introspection continued. I finished the bottle about 1.5 weeks ago and haven't had any nootropics since. Memory seems back to baseline. I don't plan on using tak again anytime soon.,1683119848,jioyzix,t3_126zob7,t1_jioc7um,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
