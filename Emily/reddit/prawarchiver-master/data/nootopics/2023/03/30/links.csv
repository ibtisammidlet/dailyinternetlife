What do I mean by ""too much""? On 4 mg it increased feelings of anxiousness. There were no physiological indications such as heart rate palpitations or sweating, it was a general feeling of dread or nervousness. On 2 mg it's similar but less intense. I found myself thinking more about existential issues, death, impermanence and the passage of time. 

1 mg seems to be a sweet spot in that I get the introspection without the existential dread. I'm still thinking about the above issues but they aren't affecting me as strongly. Today I cried watching my children eat breakfast because I was so appreciative that I have this time with them and the preciousness of the moment. That type of magnification is typical of what I'm sensing. It can be quite intense but much less so than a psychedelic trip. It's a softer intensity that gently pushes me toward these feelings rather than shoving me into them.

Overall, I'm going to continue at 1 mg for another week or maybe two. Not sure if I will continue. I believe the reflections have been beneficial and I can meditate on the experience without subjecting myself to the actual experience again.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tak 653 experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/126zob7/tak_653_experience/
