Spirited_Gap7644,"Just read up on it. One thing I would like more elaboration on is safety. As D-serine is stated to increase oxidation and was a excitotoxin. While he suggests safety I was curious if any evidence or anecdotes noted nebo to not have these traits.

AromaticPlant8504,I think taking D-serine leads to it metabolising into neurotoxins. On the other hand PAM of the receptor leads to less requirment for D-serine and therefore I think it should be protective.,1679450393,jd60kkn,t3_11xkza6,t1_jd5z37d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,"I think that’s also what he was noting that elevating D-serine too much at once can be exitotoxic but even then D-serine increases oxidation greatly.

Spirited_Gap7644,Also D-serine is noted to decrease of the levels of reduced glutathione and total antioxidant status. So it not only causes oxidation it weakens your ability to fight the oxidation.,1679451306,jd62k00,t3_11xkza6,t1_jd60kkn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
AromaticPlant8504,"Yea makes sense. On the other hand one of the other articles sirsadalot cited states the protective effect of Neb due to one of its metabolites  [https://data.epo.org/publication-server/document?iDocId=3826953&iFormat=0](https://data.epo.org/publication-server/document?iDocId=3826953&iFormat=0)""It can be seen from the data....neboglamine provides dose-dependent protection from neuronal degeneration. Indeed, while ischaemia produces a mortality of 50% in the control animals, neboglamine at the higher dose completely eliminates any mortality. Furthermore, in this model, the metabolite CR 2863 proves to be still more active than the ""parent"", since complete protection against mortality is achieved at a dose of as low as 16mg. These results would suggest that the neuroprotective effect exhibited by neboglamine is principally due to its main metabolite CR 2863",1679451923,jd63w5l,t3_11xkza6,t1_jd628zk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,That is promising! Thanks for the research as it does seem pretty protective from this study. Do you think Neb will increase oxidation as well though?,1679456136,jd6ca9s,t3_11xkza6,t1_jd63w5l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
