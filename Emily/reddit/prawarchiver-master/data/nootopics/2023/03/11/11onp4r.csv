powderdon,"Have you heard of bulletproof coffee? It seems like they may have something pretty similar.  


I personally like l-theanine with my coffee (150-200mg per cup). I've heard taurine is great too",1678597928,jbw9irc,t3_11onp4r,t3_11onp4r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"So you'll be looking for three things then: cost, tolerability, and taste. In other words, it can't be too expensive, it can't have a high risk of side-effects, and it shouldn't be off-putting in taste. I'll give some suggestions.

***Vitamins***

B-Vitamins: use the *active* form of B-vitamins, as these are more readily metabolized. Some people have issues metabolizing the inactive forms, so by using the active forms, more people will notice more of a boost from it.

Choline Supplements: a moderate dose of a choline supplement such as CDP-Choline or Alpha-GPC would be good.

L-Tyrosine: this is a lot less likely to have an effect, but it's cheap and won't ruin the taste, and some people who have a deficiency might notice a difference. N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine would be a more bioavailable form, meaning you'd need to use less of it. I don't know what its taste is like, though.

There's also ALCAR, which would provide more stimulation. But it has a bitter taste and a dosage of 0.5-1.5 grams. It's cheap, though.

***For Side-Effects***

Three options: L-Theanine, Taurine, and Glycine. Taurine is the most popular option, probably because it's cheap and has a good taste. L-Theanine might be more effective than Taurine for aiding focus, and I'm not sure which is better for calming jitters. Glycine helps some people feel relaxed and to sleep better. Not sure how it would do in an energy drink.

***Alternative Forms of Caffeine***

There's alternative forms of caffeine that supposedly have less side effects. Theacrine is the one that's usually mentioned. I'm not sure about the price, but you could look into it.

***Nootropics***

Noopept: not the best option overall for a nootropic, but it's really cheap and really well tolerated. You can add just a bit, like 30mg, and it shouldn't affect the taste.

PRL-8-53: I mention this one because it's well tolerated, like noopept, and it shouldn't cost too much either.

Tropisetron: this would be good for focus. It's also cheap and won't affect taste too much, like the others. Only issue is it causes constipation for some, and might have some med interaction, so I'd look into the pharmacology a bit.

I'm sure there's a lot of other options you could consider, but these are the ones that immediately come to mind.

By the way you should know that this subreddit is r/NooTopics, whereas the main nootropics subreddit is r/Nootropics (with an r after the t). This subreddit is more focused on experimental nootropics and is centered around a business ([everychem.com](https://everychem.com)). You'll get weird recommendations from people here. r/Nootropics, the larger subreddit will give you more standard recommendations, probably a lot of herbal supplements.",1678984452,jcg7bde,t3_11onp4r,t3_11onp4r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

EchoingSimplicity,"I'll assume this is going to be packaged in a can somehow. In that case, I personally wouldn't ever pay over $10 a can. Maybe once, but not if it's something I'm having regularly. Anything over $7 I would consider closer to 'not worth it'. Anything under $5 I'd be much more inclined to buy.",1679064865,jckm6hc,t3_11onp4r,t1_jciy1on,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
