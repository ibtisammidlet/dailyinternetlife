I’ve always been a heavy coffee drinker. Love the taste, but also absolutely need it for the focus & energy for my job.

I love experimenting with mixing my coffee with nootropics & adaptogens to keep the taste and the focus but minimize the side effects, and am contemplating putting a product together and selling it to people who’d be interested.

I want to validate that people would be interested and also gather some info about what would matter the most to a consumer of this product. 

Is anyone interested in jumping on a 15 min call to chat a bit about what a great product would look like? In return for your time, I will Venmo you $10 at the end of our call or give you a free 30-day supply when I launch. Your choice. Only requirements are to be a heavy coffee drinker and be from the US.

If anyone is interested, just comment below or book some time on my Calendly: https://calendly.com/nourmoustafa/focusedfeedback

Thanks fellow biohackers!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Help Me Create Better Coffee?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11onp4r/help_me_create_better_coffee/
