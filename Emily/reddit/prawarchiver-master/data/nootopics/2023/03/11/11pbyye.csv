Funny_Willingness433,"3 grammes per day of agmatine sulphate really worked for me as an antidepressant, it also potentiates benzodiazepines, so you can take less and get the same effect.",1678621340,jbx3fk7,t3_11pbyye,t3_11pbyye,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Benzo WD can last for like a year , it’s crazy and it sucks….they’re so insidious like that.

But you’re 1/3 of the way there, and the second half is easier than the first, I hope you can make it through.

I’ve been through addiction too and dealt with PAWS symptoms for like a year.  It really really sucked, but I’m so glad to be on the other side now and have a normal life.  

But yeah some people have good results with Agmatine.  Eventually I had to go on stronger stuff just to cope with it all.  Things that kind of dulled my mind to make me less aware of the awful reality at the time",1678626266,jbxakdv,t3_11pbyye,t1_jbx3jia,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Apprehensive-Pear955,"It really is horrible. I've not been suffering 4 months. Had 2 windows of feeling totally normal, but now 3 weeks into a wave of depression/anxiety. Getting headaches for the first time too.

I'm hopefuly it won't be a whole year for me as I was only on max 12mg of Valium for like 2 months before tapering. I probably tapered too fast though.",1678630126,jbxhdu9,t3_11pbyye,t1_jbxakdv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
