Second question in a short time, I hope that's alright (and that I also asked in the other forum).

I've been reading up on bromantane and am/was considering to try it for social anxiety.

As there seems to be limited research in English on this, I have tried some in silico analyses with bromantane.

Using SuperPred 3.0, an algorithm for target prediction of any small molecule drug (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/W1/W726/6582165), I got a very concerning hit. The absolute first hit, which the algorithm is most certain of, is the protein hERG. This is a potassium ion channel in the heart and drugs blocking this channel have shown life threatening effects in the past. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HERG)
I then did some molecular docking (with DockThor) using bromantane and hERG (PDB: 7CN0). As an outcome, the software docked bromantane perfectly into the ion channel, and displayed an estimated deltaG of -8.2 kcal/mol. At room temperature, that would correlate to an affinity (KD) of around 1 uM, a relatively high affinity.
I am not an expert in computational biology, but these values seem very concerning to me.
Can anybody confirm this?
Is there any literature that has touched upon cardiac effects? Anecdotally, from this sub, there have been people with abnormal heart palpitations.

Thanks!

Edit:
I also ran bromantane through cardioToxCSM, a webserver for cardiotoxicity predictions based on several modes of action for this toxicity (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00822), and the result also shows:
