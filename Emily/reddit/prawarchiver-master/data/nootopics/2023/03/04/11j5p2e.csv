infrareddit-1,"I’ve been trying to figure out if Tak and I have a long-term future. I’ve done 12 weeks at 2 mg. It’s very subtle and I don’t know if it’s worth the cost. I’ve tried 4 mg, but it felt too intense. I am going to try .5 mg and see if I respond the same or better, which would be more affordable.",1678042804,jb1klhx,t3_11j5p2e,t3_11j5p2e,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

lsdinsane,"Not typically, I was expecting the anti depressant effect that I get from ketamine for a week or so, but did not get that at all. And just kinda sleepiness and fatigue.

AromaticPlant8504,"**The results of the following study might be interesting to you:** ""Two clients addicted to codeine, two to heroin and four to opium tincture were orally administered 2 g L-aspartic acid four times daily for up to five days on an out-patient basis. The clients were withdrawn from the drugs on which they were physically dependent by gradually decreasing the amount of the drug abused. Some mild abstinence signs and symptoms were observed during the treatment, while the clients showed a marked improvement in social contacts and behaviour. At the end of the treatment period, and during the subsequent two weeks, not one of the treated persons showed any sign of the abstinence syndrome or expressed a feeling of used for the compulsive intake of the drug which had been abused.""

""The author's results in experiments on animals lead him to believe that the **development of physical dependence on opiates, and the abstinence syndrome upon withdrawal, may be related to a disequilibrium caused by the inhibitory effect of opiates on the activity of L-asparaginase and asparagine synthetase.**""  


""If the inhibition of L-asparaginase by L-aspartic acid is not equivalent to that of the opiate consumed, then a supplementary intake of the opiate will normally be needed. """,1689928712,jsuc6bt,t3_11j5p2e,t1_jb2z05b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lsdinsane,"In your case I would look into BPC-157, I see you're recovering opioid user. It will help heal your brain very quickly and you should be feeling back to normal with it.
