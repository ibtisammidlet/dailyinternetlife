It feels like it places a distance between me and whatever I'm trying to concentrate on and not in a good way; as if it makes things more nonsensical, which is basically the opposite of what I expected, and I wanted to like it. It makes meditation weird in the same way.

This seems to be with as low as .5mg up to 4 (though I admit I have only tried >2 a handfull of times) or what have you.

Is this fixed with some kind of dosing schedule or goldilocks zone, or some kind of nutritional need/additional noot to stack it with?",False,t5_4aoxhu,TAK-653 and brain fog?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11j5p2e/tak653_and_brain_fog/

I am wondering if anybody knows how the increased dopamine production through TH (and thus also it's release) affects the expression of dopamine receptors?

In my mind, the body will counteract this increase in dopamine through downregulation of dopamine receptors/reducing the dopamine sensitivity. 
Can anybody explain how bromantane apparently does not cause de-sensitization and thus no tolerance or dependence and withdrawal?

I am trying to raise my baseline of dopamine sensitivity for social anxiety, and would rather not have to rely on substances to do so. Hence, the apparently long-lasting effects of bromantane and ALCAR seem very intriguing to me.

Another question of mine is how bromantane compares to amantadine in it's dopaminergic effect. Amantadine has a long track record of safety in humans, so it feels ""safer"" to try amantadine, if it elicits similar effects.
