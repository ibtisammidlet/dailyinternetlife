It seems GDNF and kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition are the main things responsible for its persistent dopaminergic effects. Also amantadine and bromantane are most similar (with bromantane seemingly more stimulating, possible due to less NMDA antagonism), and the safety of bromantane isn't bad as it has been shown repeatedly to be safe in clinical and preclinical studies.",1677946002,jawc6cz,t3_11hypme,t3_11hypme,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

It doesn't cause desensitisation of impacted tyrosine hydroxylase levels. The latter isn't particularly helpful as many dopamine agents have no issues with their mechanism of action, the issue is in receptor behaviour. 

People seem to consistently get confused with this as the YouTube marketeers are deceptive on purpose.

Why do you think bromantane is considered superior to amantadine? As far as I know amantadine could also interact with potassium channels, however at a concentration 3 times higher than generally seen serum concentrations (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901515/). Is it known that bromantane has a lower IC50?

sirsadalot,"You don't know what you're talking about. Bromantane is one of the only dopaminergics to show persistent elevations in dopamine after discontinuation. Dopamine receptors may be elevated because that happens to D1 with almost any dopaminergic, such as meth, which you think is great because you get high on reddit anecdotes about DOPAMINE RECEPTOR, NEED MORE DOPAMINE RECEPTOR.

sirsadalot,"Bromantane hasn't been given a modern assay but ~~while the concentration for Amantadine used was 3x more than therapeutic~~ ([it wasn't, he's wrong](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/133398)), it would explain other things, such as the reduction to inflammatory cytokines, increase in GDNF & improvement to dopamine receptor sensitivity and normalization of ON and OFF time in parkinson's. Since Bromantane reduces work errors/ frequency of attempts in contrast to syndocarb/ mesocarb (a DRI), it suggests resensitization of inhibitory medium spiny neurons and thus normalized activation D2 receptors in the presence of elevated dopamine. Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition explains the reduced inflammatory cytokines --> indirect inhibition to HDACs (thus increase in neurotrophic growth factors --> C-Fos --> dopamine receptor sensitivity), upregulated tyrosine hydroxylase --> lack of: overstimulation/ noise/ psychosis/ dyskinesia, persistent post-cessation increased dopaminergic behavior, etc. that is seen with both compounds. It's likely that sigma is involved in both at active concentrations, but it wouldn't explain the therapeutic benefits for either. The reason Bromantane is thought to be more stimulating is in part mediated by the possibility of less anticholinergic and dissociative effects, but also because it was said to be by the Russians who chose it from a laundry list of hundreds of adamantane compounds, of which Amantadine was included. Users who have tried both would anecdotally agree, but there's also the fact that Bromantane has a much higher LD50 than amantadine.

If you're really interested in Bromantane, it's up for sale on everychem as a nasal spray, because when the pharmacokinetics were observed for oral vs. IV, there was a 60x decrease in elimination constant (thus diminishing the half life) due to too much fat solubility and lower organ accumulation, as well as a 70% loss from first pass. The brain half life is 7 hours, but it could potentially be reabsorbed from plasma over the course of 10 days when used intranasally, as well as increasing the bioavailability.

I feel like if I use it continuously then stop abruptly, my mood takes a nosedive (withdrawal)? Am I actually building a tolerance here?

jjkompi,"Thanks for the insights!
Sorry mate, I did not understand the first part of your reply and the subsequent string of explanations.
What are you referring to when you say ""while the concentration for Amantadine used was 3x more than therapeutic""? 
What I was referring to, is that in experiments, it was shown that amantadine has an IC50 of 29uM on potassium channels, in vitro. At therapeutic dosages of 100-300 mg, amantadine never had a higher serum concentration in humans than 10uM. That would mean that it is unlikely that it would have any noticable effects on the potassium channels in a clinical setting. 
My question then being - you're saying bromantane exerts its effects through interactions with the potassium receptors - where can I find data that proves this? Or is this a conclusion from the fact that Amantadine is able to bind these receptors (though likely negligible at therapeutic dosages)?
And again, which studies show that bromantane is superior to amantadine?

jjkompi,"Also, you're saying that the sigma agonism does not contribute to the therapeutic benefits?
This excerpt of the review paper on amantadine I linked above argues against your point:

Sigma 1 receptors Amantadine is a very potent ligand of sigma-1 receptors (Fig. 3, Table ​Table4)4) which has been first described by Kornhuber and colleagues (Kornhuber et al. 1993). These receptors are also located intracellularly, e.g., on membranes of endoplasmatic reticulum and control Ca2+ signaling (Monnet 2005). Sigma-1 receptors enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity (Weiser et al. 1995), modulate NMDA stimulated DA release (Gonzalez-Alvear and Werling 1995), increase DA in vivo in the striatum (Gudelsky 1995), and decrease DA uptake (Thompson et al. 2001). All these effects may participate in the symptomatologic effects of amantadine in Parkinson’s disease. Sigma-1 receptors have been suggested as targets for neuroprotection in Parkinson’s disease (Francardo 2014; Mori et al. 2012; Rousseaux and Greene 2015). Sigma-1 agonists may be beneficial for: neuroprotection in general (Decoster et al. 1995; Maurice and Lockhart 1997), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Mancuso et al. 2012), Alzheimer’s disease (Meunier et al. 2006), ischemia (Oneill et al. 1995), anxiety (Ji et al. 2017), and depression (Raupp-Barcaro et al. 2018; Skuza et al. 2014). Moreover, activation of sigma-1 receptors may enhance recovery from TBI through increase in synaptogenesis and inhibition of inflammation (Dong et al. 2016; Ryskamp et al. 2019).

I think there's two likely explanations for what you're describing (which I've experienced to some extent, though definitely not tolerance--the acute ""rush"" isn't going to last forever btw, but the overall effects remain consistent).

First, it could well be potentiating whatever ADHD stimulant you're currently taking. As such, when you don't take bromantane your mood and ADHD may become impaired (esp. if you're already undermedicated).

The second possibility is that, because you're already undermedicated, your body just has a rough time adjusting back to the ADHD med you have without the extra boost from the bromantane.

These are educated guesses based on my own experience with ADHD and bromantane, but I feel people are awfully quick to blame bromantane. There's a lot that could be going on here, frankly.",1678035483,jb11wy0,t3_11hypme,t1_jawrfi4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

There are still studies that happen every year on aged drugs to find out more about what they actually do.  And moreover, neurochemistry is different among different people. 

A schizophrenic that takes amphetamine can be sent into psychosis that lasts long after the amph has been cleared from their system. It is so intensely dependent on how a person's brain is wired.
