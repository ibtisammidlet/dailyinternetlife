Before anyone comes at me, for some context I sustained a brain Injury and a neurologist started me on an TCA (anti-cholregnic agent) I was not in any state to make a decision and tbh didn't really know what it was, once I had any understanding I was like get me off this. Went to an SNRI for 7 days then started getting palpitations and the doctor said get off ASAP. Now my nervous system is f**ked. They keep trying to throw more poison pills at me...now my cognition has come back and no way I'm taking them.

Is there anything/supplements I can take to support my nervous system recovering?

For context 28F, no previous health issues, marathon runner who is now bed bound.

On stimulants such as ritalin and coffee, I feel quite tense and zombified, with a bit of memory loss (tip-of-the-tongue effect).

My history includes the chronic use of SSRIs and TCAs, I wonder if that has lowered the usual amount of dopamine produced in my brain, which is why L-Tyrosine and MAO-B inhibitors work well, but not DRIs?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why am I benefiting more from L-tyrosine and Rasagiline than stimulants which are supposedly more dopaminergic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11lwh8j/why_am_i_benefiting_more_from_ltyrosine_and/
