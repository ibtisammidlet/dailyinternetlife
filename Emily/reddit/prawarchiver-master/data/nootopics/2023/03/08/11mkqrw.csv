Genetic-Reimon,"I did 20 days of cerebrolysin at 10ML per day. I had to inject 3 places daily and I felt like a pin cushion by the end of it but I would say it helped me recover 50% of what was lost in the TBI. Maybe another course in 6 months and I will be close to normal.

I also found Magnesium, Vitamin D, Phospatidyl Serine and high doses of Omega 3 very helpful. I eat 8-10 ounces of salmon daily. I also recommend researching and getting the best quality B vitamins. 

I liked modafinil a lot but I get lots of side effects. Some people advised Adrafinil but I havenâ€™t tried that yet.",1678379569,jbk0qz1,t3_11mkqrw,t3_11mkqrw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
WouldYouCalmDown,"Pending the Brain injury, Cerebrolysin would be you best bet, and/or BPC-157. Given we don't know the details of what happened or what part of the brain was affected, you'd either have to research which is best for you or let us know so that we can help gauge which. BPC-157 has the potential to negate effects from amphetamine for a while after cessation, so if you do take amps, try Cerebrolysin first.",1678403209,jblqprg,t3_11mkqrw,t3_11mkqrw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"If the issue you were originally trying to address (or that your doctors were trying to) with TCAs and/or SNRIs was pain-related (I'm guessing on the indication here), you may want to look into Lyrica (pregabalin).

Just started it myself for severe, IBS-related abdominal pain that has not responded to traditional treatment. So far, it's a godsend if a bit on the sedating side (still functional tho).
