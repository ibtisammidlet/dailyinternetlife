SunDevil329,"Edit: realized I never addressed your actual question! I've not experienced any withdrawal or addiction from emoxypine, and until recently I was taking 250mg 3x daily (now down to 75mg 3x daily). I'm in the process of trying to eliminate substances that aren't really necessary/helping me anymore, hence the reduction.

Emoxypine is technically classified as an antioxidant actoprotector (defined as a synthetic adaptogen, which bromantane is also commonly described as). It has a wide range of activity beyond those that affect anxiety, but I'm not going to pretend to understand it's pharmacology.

Suffice to say it's somewhat unique and is not a typical anxiolytic. I'd check out Cosmic Nootropic's instructions for Mexidol. These are typically translated directly from the Russian insert.

While it's not terribly popular on this subreddit (probably because there is some minor potential for dependence, though I find the likelihood of that remote), you may also find some relief from Picamilon. You'd just want to stick to the indications, as with any medication.

I use it from time to time (both, but I'm referring to picamilon specifically) and it's helpful for occasional anxiety. I rarely see any benefit from taking more than 50mg at a time.

SunDevil329,"Glutamine and/or taurine supplementation may help in the long run. Dosages vary, but 500mg of both together is fairly calming.

Theanine will also be helpful, as would anything that helps modulate/calm glutamate excitability.

NAC or NACET would also likely be helpful during this time.

Magnesium L-threonate, vitamin C, omega-3's are also highly recommended for general health. If you're not taking a high quality multivitamin and/or B Complex, I'd also recommend looking into that.

Selank would likely provide symptomatic relief. Any form would work, NA-Selank Amidate is usually the go-to.",1678553672,jbtmwix,t3_11ogsct,t3_11ogsct,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Whatever_acc,Olds take it like candies here in Russia because it can be prescribed for cerebral bloodflow/cognitive impairment/strokes. I can get why it can serve as oxidative stress protector or reducer of ischaemic neuron death (on paper!!! soviet/russian drugs are usually not properly evaluated to work or not by evidence based science) But I don't get why it would help with benzos more than lifestyle changes and things like agmatine.,1678574938,jbuzyw6,t3_11ogsct,t3_11ogsct,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ketaminemidazolam,"Actually after benzodiazepine use the symptoms arrise from receptor-uncoupling rather than from receptor downregulation. Big difference!

Apprehensive-Pear955,"Thanks. The issue with Benzo Withdrawal is downregulated GABA receptors, rather than a lack of GABA.

clonazopidrone,Interesting. I had a couple questions if you had a minute. Is it common for people to take it for alcohol withdrawal?

SunDevil329,"Yes, that's mostly accurate. I don't think picamilon is as harsh as a GABA agonist, like you said it's more of a vehicle for getting GABA to cross the BBB.

Mexidol/emoxypine sounds like it acts primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors, from the literature I've found.

I'll try to throw the PDF up on Google Drive a little later, it's fairly interesting. Excerpt:

""[N]ot having the direct affinity to benzodiazepine and GABA receptors, mexidol exercises the modifying action by intensifying their binding ability. 

These data together with the results of the analyses of mexidol's anxiolytic action with the help of analyzers bring the idea that mexidol's anxiolytic mechanism is determined by its modulatory effect on the benzodiazepine chlorine-ionophore receptor complex.""",1678550842,jbtg62h,t3_11ogsct,t1_jbtfj0b,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
RamityCamity,"I would look into a low low dose naltrexone and eventually titration, low dosing the receptors with an antagonistic drug like naltrexone can cause a reverse effect through upregulation after a given time through the bodys need to reach homeostasis.

Things would not get instantly better, but in the long term, it could help. Maybe this paired with emoxypine and maybe mag l-threonate could have a great effect on you.",1678559582,jbu0zgx,t3_11ogsct,t1_jbtfj0b,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"NACET is a far more effective form of NAC that boasts oral bioavailability upwards of 70-80% (NAC has an oral bioavailability around 4% for comparison). You'd likely see far greater benefits and with less dosing required with NACET vs. NAC.

That said, it has the strongest smell of any noot I've used, and it doesn't taste much better. Given the small amount required, the taste really isn't an issue for me. It's easily masked if you prefer.

As far as sources, for NACET both Everychem and LiftMode stock it.

For Selank in the UK, you may want to give PureRawz a try. I've made a handful of purchases from them. They're relatively quick and most items are reasonably priced.

SunDevil329,"Actually I had thought of mentioning Agmatine sulfate as a possibility as well. I'm not sure of the precise mechanism involved (or agmatine's pharmacology in general), but anecdotally I've heard it can be incredibly helpful for kratom and/or phenibut discontinuation, tolerance, and withdrawal.

May be worth investigating. Appears it may be worth a shot:

""Agmatine’s effectiveness for drug addiction requires further research, but preliminary animal studies show promise in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. These studies showed a decrease in alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and anxiety after supplementation.""

clonazopidrone,Yep it helps a lot. I have combined emoxypine with agmatine and I'd say agmatine is superior for withdrawal but perhaps emoxypine is better once you are off benzos entirely,1678746277,jc46b6t,t3_11ogsct,t1_jbwvqqn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Apprehensive-Pear955,"Thanks. I am slightly concerned that Emoxypine/Mexidol will interfere with the healing of my GABA receptors or at least that, because ""mexidol

SunDevil329,"I had thought of that too. In my experience, emoxypine is far too subtle a substance and the pharmacology isn't the best understood (to my knowledge).

Overall, I view it more as a potent antioxidant. I actually take clonazepam as well (panic) and I was a little surprised when I read this, as I didn't notice any difference.

Your caution is overall a good thing (and well founded), but I doubt emoxypine will be an issue.",1678628095,jbxdm17,t3_11ogsct,t1_jbwy0ku,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
