caffeinehell,What symptoms do you have? Any blunting emotions and if so does this help that?,1679721663,jdl81il,t3_121a092,t3_121a092,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,Finally a anecdote for TAK-653 alongside some sort of ADHD medication. I know Bupropion is used for anxiety and depression but it’s also prescribed for ADHD. So it’s cool to see some sort of harder stimulant anecdote with TAK and also working well with it. You should continue to report back again in a month with any different results! I know TAK takes a couple weeks to build up I’ve read.,1679737498,jdlqo8s,t3_121a092,t3_121a092,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Fwiw, I've been taking TAK at 1-1.5mg for 2 weeks now (tomorrow will be the start of week 3). I also take Focalin XR 40mg (dexmethylphenidate) every morning.

I recently switched from a total daily dose of 40mg Adderall (TID: 20/10/10) to Concerta 54mg, then finally to Focalin about 3-4 weeks ago. Still feel like it's not effectively managing my ADHD, but neither was Adderall.

Wrt TAK-653, I seem to be more ""with it"" and often get a mood boost that lifts me out of depression or negative thought cycles. Unfortunately, this hasn't been consistent yet.

I started to get anxiety and restlessness at 1.5mg, but I've been going through a lot the past month (both med changes and personal/work issues) so I'm hesitant to blame TAK.

Happy to keep you apprised if you're interested. Fair warning, I'm on a number of meds that may well make my experience unique.",1679754226,jdmgz83,t3_121a092,t1_jdlqo8s,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,Very interesting. It’s actually really impressive to see two anecdotes from two individuals mirroring very similar experiences from TAK-653. Seems to also augment with the medication as well. Has your Focalin been more effective from TAK as well or any other sides noted? Also would like to hear a month update and see if TAK continues to build and synergize with your dopaminergic medication.,1679768254,jdndnqk,t3_121a092,t1_jdmgz83,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Pure_Nourishment,"Interesting. Well, good luck! Hope it all helps and you are able to find something sustainable.

For me, Bupropion side effects scared me in only 5 days of taking it. I'm still navigating the medication route. The trail and error sucks.",1679764349,jdn4dnz,t3_121a092,t1_jdn0q57,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
