Hi there,

I am longtime sufferer from depression and anxiety. I also suffer from regular sinusitis.

I have taken an OTC medication for nasal congestion for a few times which includes 60mg of Pseudoephedrine and to my surprise it reduces some of my anxiety/depression and gives me a clear headspace.. I feel much more calm and collected on it. The interesting thing is, I have tried so many medication for depression and anxiety (and also for suspected ADHD), but none of them makes me feel this way (not even Vyvanse or Methylphenidat). I know its not a good idea to take Pseudoephedrine everyday but I would like to implement it in my regimen. So how often do you think its safe to take it? Maybe twice a week on non-consecutive days?
