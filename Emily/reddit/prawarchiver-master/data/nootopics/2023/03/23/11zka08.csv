wetliikeimbook,"I love pseudoephedrine, unfortunately it will wreck your prostate over time. I used it just 2x a week or so for awhile and had to stop because the prostate issues built up over time.",1679581708,jdcwhn3,t3_11zka08,t3_11zka08,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
ArcticPlatypus,"I’m pretty sure the beta adrenergic receptors downregulate fairly quickly. Didn’t stop me from taking 30-60 mg of ephedrine every day for 4 months from like September-January. It was definitely more effective initially, but never completely lost it’s motivation enhancing effects. I cold turkeyed it without issue. I highly don’t recommend this approach, as you’re probably just wasting money if you take it daily, and possibly doing some harm. I think your approach of twice a week on non consecutive days makes sense. Also, I do understand that pseudoephedrine is a different compound than ephedrine. I actually think I noticed more of a mood enhancing and longer lasting effect when I took pseudoephedrine when I had covid. 

A lot of people take ephedrine for extended periods of time for it’s fat burning effects. Not suggesting that this bodybuilder style intake of stimulants is in any way healthy, but arguably the tons of people who have tolerated lots of ECA (ephedrine, caffeine, *aspirin*) cycles anecdotally exhibit that it’s not the worst thing in the world.

But yes, use it sparingly to maintain the benefit.",1679580744,jdcu5hw,t3_11zka08,t3_11zka08,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,This is how stims work. They trigger fight or flight response. You either experience less anxiety and self-confidence or restlessness and anxiety.It all depends on individual and the dose as well as the type of stim.,1679622334,jdfr7mc,t3_11zka08,t3_11zka08,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

ArtisticSuggestion6,"The ""A"" in ECA is for aspirin. It's a blood thinner and enhances the effects of the ephedrine and caffeine combo. Advil is a brand of ibuprofen. Not the same.",1679647031,jdgtwfv,t3_11zka08,t1_jdcu5hw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
wetliikeimbook,"You can do a quick Google, but essentially it being a potent vasoconstrictor, it constricts the prostatic capsule and causes resulting issues that make BPH flare up much worse or cause it to appear spontaneously.
