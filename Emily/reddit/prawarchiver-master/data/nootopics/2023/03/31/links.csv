The powder is not water-soluble so it's not easy to consume it. Is it better to take on an empty stomach or it doesn't matter ? Does someone who has tried carnosic acid and got good results can give me some feedback on the matter ?,False,t5_4aoxhu,How to take Carnosic Acid ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/128lch2/how_to_take_carnosic_acid/

She’s been on SSRI’s (Zoloft) for depression in the past and does not wish to return.

Her being new to nootropics I’ve persuaded her to use ALCAR in tandem with Agmatine as an alternative to target the systems above.

Anyone here had a similar experience and success with this combination?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Agmatine & ALCAR for depression - experiences,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/128kli6/agmatine_alcar_for_depression_experiences/
CryptoEscape,1680284146,self.NooTopics,127svkn,True,42,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/127svkn/why_is_it_methylphenidate_can_control_all_my_adhd/,1709901435,14,"Amphetamine Salts (Adderall) give me such incredible social grace, at just 10-15 mg.  I speak with great clarity.  I communicate effectively, both verbally and non verbally.  It also controls nearly every other ADHD Symptom.

Methylphenidate (10-20 mg) also controls nearly all my ADHD symptoms.  But it barely enhances my social grace…,sure it makes me extroverted and wanting to socialize….,but it only slightly (barely) improves my ability to communicate effectively.

What is it that’s unique about Amphetamine that enhances social grace?  

Perhaps some serotonin?  I’m unsure about that though, because it doesn’t seem to release much at lower doses.

Does it target some other receptors, neurotransmitters, processes, etc that are related to communication?

Perhaps Adderall has a stronger cholinergic effect and that’s why?

Would love to hear some thoughts….",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why is it Methylphenidate can control all my ADHD symptoms except speaking clearly?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/127svkn/why_is_it_methylphenidate_can_control_all_my_adhd/
