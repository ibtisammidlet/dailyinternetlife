>It has been postulated that ketamine, by antagonizing NMDA receptors in GABAergic interneurons, attenuates the inhibitory action of this system on glutamatergic tonus. This blockade causes the disinhibition of pyramidal cells, which causes a burst of glutamatergic transmission\[11\]. In particular, the glutamate released under these conditions preferentially stimulates alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-5-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, promoting a transient sodium influx that depolarizes the cell and activates the voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC). This event causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the synaptic cleft, as a result of calcium influx by VDCC  


Given that TAK-653 is an AMPA positive allosteric modulator, would this imply that the receptors would experience greater activation (and greater BDNF release) when ketamine & TAK are co-administered? Alternatively, given the risk of excitotoxicity, would less ketamine be needed to achieve the same result, reducing the health concerns from ketamine use?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Could TAK-653 enhance the effectiveness of ketamine treatment?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/121z4eh/could_tak653_enhance_the_effectiveness_of/
