P21throwaway,"Yeah, but seems unlikely given his answer down below. He wants to take a ”science based approach”, you know.",1680096269,je4xxee,t3_122s1ld,t1_jdsdk77,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,It’s true! Most people just fear the injection protocol. Where’s as the aforementioned peptides are more easily and safely taken intranasal.,1679859202,jds4o8m,t3_122s1ld,t1_jds30ma,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
P21throwaway,"Thanks for sharing your opinion, byt that doesn’t answer my question.

Personally having tried all of them for extensive periods, I disagree, atleast in nootropic/cognitive enhancing terms.

As for Adalank:

sirsadalot,"They're not interesting to me, formed only on hype and not actual science. If you want to keep up to date with my actual developments, I recently made a post. I'm most interested in taking a science based approach to things, with proper methodology. Obscure concoctions fueled by hype do not interest me.",1680030119,je1icbd,t3_122s1ld,t1_je0hz1x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
0phenyl,"Two days ago he confirmed in his discord that he would be listing Pinealon.

Not sure about P21 and Adamax, but I've done a course of Pinealon (a few of us group bought some from a lab) with great results.

It'll probably cost around $120-140/g from everychem, average dose being 1-3mg IntraNasal.",1680164114,je8zsl9,t3_122s1ld,t1_je4xxee,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,Here's my reservation. I've taken whiffs of cerebro from open ampules and nearly gagged. How nasty is it administered intranasal?,1679859623,jds5o9s,t3_122s1ld,t1_jds4o8m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

P21throwaway,"Then why did you add Semax and Selank, as Adamax and Adalank are just modified/improved versions of them? And why exactly did you add NSI-189 but not P21, is it that much ”better” and proven? I think it would be good for you to be a little more interested in the customers opinion/wants rather than being this arrogant.",1680068390,je3uyly,t3_122s1ld,t1_je1icbd,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,Well I wouldn’t administer intranasal as anecdotally seems to be unsafe. Whereas the other peptides mentioned here are famously known to be safe intranasal.,1679860344,jds7e1u,t3_122s1ld,t1_jds5o9s,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Just do cortexin intranasally then,1679875373,jdt5ghy,t3_122s1ld,t1_jds5o9s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,Maybe if it's going directly into the schnozz and doesn't have a chance to mix with air it's gross. Any preference on it vs cortexin?,1679875602,jdt5xy9,t3_122s1ld,t1_jdt2tk0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,The comment above yours mentioned cerebrolysin and I believe u/Friedrich_Ux has administered it that way before (unsure if he's switched over to cortexin),1679861687,jdsal3e,t3_122s1ld,t1_jds7e1u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
P21throwaway,"Yeah, much much more, especially NSI-189. And what about NA-Semax/Selank then? I guess there’s a lot of evidence for them being better than Semax right?",1680563970,jeumqhm,t3_122s1ld,t1_jeo0lmf,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,Oh? just from a lot users saying it would be unsafe to administer intranasal. Is that just a misconception?,1679875564,jdt5v4d,t3_122s1ld,t1_jdt2rjp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Complete_Still7584,"I like both; but clinically, cortexin has been proven to beat cerebrolysin in every single category. So, basically Cortexin is PROVEN to be more efficacious.
