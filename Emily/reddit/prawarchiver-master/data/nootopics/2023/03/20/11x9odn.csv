ldulm77,I am also interested to know. My Semax/Selank from them should be here tomorrow,1679438832,jd59tb9,t3_11x9odn,t3_11x9odn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

ldulm77,I only tried the Selank today. Hard to say if I felt anything really. Subtle if so. I know that for some people it takes a few days to really notice anything so I'm probably gonna do 2 more days just Selank and then add the Semax,1679541463,jdb6onl,t3_11x9odn,t1_jdb00xb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

ldulm77,I really don't think I got much out of either one. Selank definitely didn't do much for anxiety,1682718152,ji3wrz6,t3_11x9odn,t1_ji3sseh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
