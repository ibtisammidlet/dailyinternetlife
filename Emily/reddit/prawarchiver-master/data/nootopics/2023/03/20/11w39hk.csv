herbalist65pete,"Idebenone or skq1?  Will have to research.  Big fan of M.B. and believe I garner benefits when I take before my sauna or red light sessions.  N=1 so encouraging to see photo-modulation data. I would gander that heat sensor proteins, which signal epigenetic pathways, find synergy with M.B. as well.

Huge fan of L-Carnitine.  I take 3 grams before my cardio workouts, with some MCT oil and Cardarine, plus a pre-workout with AKG, mentioned below, betaine, citrulline, arginine and agmatine then CoQ10, TUDCA, K's for electron transport chain, PQQ. All MAJOR generals in mito support.  At my age, insane cardio energy.

For an interesting take on PQQ, check out a respected poster on Longecity, Turnbuckle. Mitochondrial fission and fusion.

For NAD+ support, I resort to peptides,  not NMN nor NR.

&#x200B;

Mito1 (fission)

● NAM+R, 1 g of each

● AKG, 1 g

● PQQ, 20 mg

Mito2 (fusion)

● GMS, 1 g

● AKG, 1 g

● PQQ, 20 mg
