Balahkaye,"That‚Äôs a pretty low dose of bromantane.. what‚Äôs your ROA? How long have you been taking both of your compounds? Even though the dose is low it‚Äôs a very potent compound and with your current medication it‚Äôs pretty much a wild card as for what‚Äôs it‚Äôs doing in that combination. I use 9-18 mg intranasal almost everyday and that‚Äôs very potent. Bromantane up regulates tyrosine tyrosine hydroxylase, also a significant increase in the 5-HT and 5-HIAA content in the frontal cortex and delayed an increase in their content in subcortical brain regions. It inhibited my sleep at first as well. I‚Äôd suggest 2-3 grams of Gylcine and or 1-2 caps of ZMA together or try them separately at different doses to see what reacts with you better. I personally take 1 gram glycine and 2 caps or ZMA. It the best sleep stack I‚Äôve ever taken. Glycine also has significant benefits with alleviating schizophrenia symptoms although the doses were extremely high.

One-Remote-9842,Do you find 200mg effective for your schizophrenia? That‚Äôs a very low dose from what I read. They say you need 400-800mg.,1689700048,jsh4wpd,t3_11x3di3,t3_11x3di3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
uglegutn,"I've been on amisulpride since september 2022 going from 400mg-200mg, now i take 200mg daily. Bromantane i started with last week on monday, began with 50mg orally and experienced moderate-strong effects from just that dose the following 4 days, so i didnt redose during that period until saturday I dosed 10mg orally. I sorta just redose when the effects wear off, which seems to last a while for me. Also it might be the amisulpride synergizing with the dopamine increase from bromantane in the frontal cortex, cause blocking of d2 presynaptic receptor increases release of dopamine there aswell which amisulpride does at low doses from 300mg-50mg. So this could be that the synergy overstimulates me and causes insomnia. Will try glycine again, i actually have a bag of it laying around. Thanks for the advice! :)",1679400473,jd2mkm0,t3_11x3di3,t1_jd2iny0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Qu3tza101c0at101,Bromantane lowers dopamine in frontal cortex. GDNF is not good for schitzophrenia. The synergy causing your insomnia is just more D1 activation in other parts of the brain.,1679408200,jd32jlb,t3_11x3di3,t1_jd2mkm0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bromantane mainly works through GDNF, and studies it show it raises dopamine everywhere except the frontal cortex, where it actually just raises serotonin.",1679426768,jd4ejbe,t3_11x3di3,t1_jd4e3eb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
