Turbulent_Zone_5324,"Minoxidil shortens the telogen (resting) phase, thus increasing the anagen phase (hairgrowth), whereas BDNF/TrkB shortens the anagen phase via raising transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2), resulting in a faster catagen phase (early hairloss). 

Finasteride indirectly has a similar mechanism compared to minoxidil, by ‘pushing’ hair follicles (impacted by DHT) from the telogen into the anagen phase and/or anagen phase prolongation via its 5AR-inhibition/DHT-reduction. (‘and/or’ because the exact mechanism of DHT on hair follicles isn’t fully known. Same counts for minoxidil)

In vitro, “[catagen induction by BDNF was partially reversible through co-administration of TGFβ-neutralizing antibody](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15322193)”, so it can be somewhat reversed. However, I don’t think the practical application of the neutralizing antibodies is realizable.

But I think the effect of BDNF/TrkB-induced hairloss in the presence of the hairgrowth and hairloss-prevention effects from the Minoxidil and Finasteride combined, will be negligible after all.",1678659201,jbzdtac,t3_11pp255,t3_11pp255,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
DidNotVote2020,"Compounds that counteract TGFbeta and increase growth factors like IGF-1 I suspect would help counteract this. Minoxidil would definitely help as it is a strong hair agonist. Bimatoprost is also a strong addition (PgF2alpha agonist). This shifting from anagen to catagen by BDNF occurs downstream of the androgen receptor. Finastride by itself I would not expect to do much, except to reduce a compounding induced by androgen receptor activation in the scalp.

sirsadalot,BDNF-induced hair loss is downstream of androgen receptors. The leading theory in hair loss states prolactin antibodies targeting autocrine prolactin are the best chance at a cure. Not to be confused with systemic prolactin.,1678728402,jc2wche,t3_11pp255,t3_11pp255,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,"If BDNF induced hair loss activates the same cascade of effects as male sex hormones perhaps nootropic form of magnesium namely magnesium l-threonate can be helpful https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO201030859416457.page

Anyway for me  7'8-dihydroxyflavone and its superior synthetic derivative both seem to have initially significant nootropic, mood enhancing and motivational effects but heavy tolerance develops within days and is seemingly persistent.

chaseme1988,"I can't reply or see your comment for some reason but got the notification.  I am looking to try 4-DMA but am already taking finasteride and minoxidil for hair loss. I am just weary of making the problem worse. But if TrkB agonists are causing hair loss through a hormonal mechanism/ 5a-reductase/DHT, I'd imagine the finasteride would counter it. But then that leads me to wonder if it would counter any of the benefits too.",1678653687,jbz0tyn,t3_11pp255,t3_11pp255,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"I've taken 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF on a 5 on, 2 off cycle for probably at least 3 months. Was alternating with polygala on the weekends to mitigate the possibility of TrkB downregulation.

Currently taking a break from both due to recent changes to my psych and gastro meds, as well as part of an effort to reexamine the usefulness and/or need for what I take.

Wasn't aware of an issue with hair loss, but I did not experience anything noticeable. It seems that the growth of my hair has slowed in general (nothing extreme and I could be wrong), but I just assumed that was age. I'm about to turn 39.",1678657091,jbz8sxk,t3_11pp255,t3_11pp255,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

l-threonate,"I have noticed a decrease in the intensity of its effects, after continuous usage, that does indeed seem persistent. However I've seen many people recommend cycling it with polyglala, or just taking polyglala with it to mitigate this. I haven't cycled 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF  this way, per se, but I did take polyglala for a couple weeks during a time when I didn't have 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF due to financial constraints. The next time I got some, after finishing the polyglala weeks earlier, I did notice much more intense effects from the 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF, akin to what I experienced when taking it the first couple of times I purchased it.

I would also recommend Magnesium L-threonate for any male pattern baldness issues, and that's in addition to its myriad cognitive benefits. It would be the only kind of magnesium I take, if it weren't so expensive.
