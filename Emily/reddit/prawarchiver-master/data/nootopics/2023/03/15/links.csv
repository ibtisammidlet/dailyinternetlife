The recovery is rough I'm not gonna lie. I developed anxiety and I have a near constant feeling of brain fog and just feeling mentally ""off"" in addition to some brutal physical fatigue. I've been running 1mg/day subq Thymosin Alpha 1 for a few days to speed up recovery and rebalance my immune system and I definitely think it has made a difference already.

However after reading extensively on Semax and Selank I have high hopes that they can help my brain heal from any damage done by the virus and reduce lingering neuroinlammation. I read that they can also stimulate the immune system as well. I just placed an order for a bottle of each from Everychem and I'm both excited and nervous to try them out. I'll probably try Selank on it's own first and then add the Semax. 

Thoughts? Anyone else have a similar experience? Also just curious how Everychem can have their prices so low? I know the owner is a mod here and I believe it to be legit I'm just honestly curious how they can sell stuff so cheap?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Selank/Semax to mentally recover from meningitis,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11s9h19/selanksemax_to_mentally_recover_from_meningitis/
