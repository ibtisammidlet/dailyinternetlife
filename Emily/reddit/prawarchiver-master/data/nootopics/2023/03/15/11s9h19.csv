ScienceWins_87,"Very sorry to read this. Keep Cerebrolysin in your thoughts as well. It's been an amazing experience for me.

I tried SEMAX back in 2015 and it's certainly worth a shot but Cerebrolysin feels more comprehensive.",1678922491,jcd1wyk,t3_11s9h19,t3_11s9h19,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

ldulm77,I had the lumbar puncture done in radiology guided with imagery after the ER doc failed to do it in 3 attempts bedside. My spinal fluid cultures came back positive for the presence of Epstein Barr which is what caused the meningitis I guess.

ScienceWins_87,"Neuro-COVID, if that's a thing. 

I don't want to up your expectations but it in my case it felt nothing short of healing - I'm better in some regards than I was pre-infection and know in my heart that there is no ""nootropic"" out there I want more than Cerebro for the rest of my life. 

I've tried NSI-18, Dihexa, TAK-653, SEMAX, 4 DMA 7 8 DHF, Aniracetam, Phenylpiracetam, ISRIB, Noopept, Sunifiram, LSD etc for years. All of them were useful as well.

Kratom_Dumper,"I have MCAS (just found out two months ago that I had it) for the last 7 years so I have been dealing with chronic neuroinflammation.

Started using cerebrolysin in order to quit a kratom addiction which it worked really good for but it also worked great for neuroinflammation.

I am curious which other things you recommend for neuroinflammation to take together with cerebrolysin or if you know anything good against mast cells or histamine?

I am back on Kratom but at a low dose and only been on it a short time so planning on tapering down and once I get cerebrolysin then do 10 days of 5-10ml together with Semax for 10 days and then quit the kratom on day 6 and start with phenylpiracetam at 100mg per day for 30 days.",1680587900,jevxuxw,t3_11s9h19,t1_jcepeuc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ldulm77,Too late lmao I've googled everything there is to know about it. Its actually the reason I finally went to the ER. 6 days straight of fever that breached 103-104°F and just wouldn't go away. I was googling what the fuck could possibly cause a fever without respiratory or sinus symptoms that would last so long. They admitted me immediately.,1678938752,jce21wu,t3_11s9h19,t1_jcdyz4d,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
ScienceWins_87,"(Very) positive. It's not like they are meant to not help but as with everything, YMMV. A lot of them I had extensive experience with previous to my infection, especially NSI-189.

TAK-653 and NSI-189 stand out to me - completely different experiences but those were the ones that surprised me the most whenever I fully engaged with them.

I find most anecdotes here on TAK-653 really capture its essence. Ability to introspect and dig deeper really seems like the most common theme.
NSI-189 on the other hand is more all over the place with only but a few consistent features matching my experience: anxiety, improved memory, and something I can't exactly put into words - an uncanny ability to provide you with a second childhood of sorts. It feels like your long term memory is somewhere out of sight, waiting for you to come out of your cycle, and you have little else but what's in front of you and a new found emotional resilience. I've seen someone else describing it as feeling like the exact opposite of being sculpted out of a block of marmore and i believe it to be accurate. Your far less constrained by the emotional strands that lead your life up until then, especially those that were based on submissive behaviour. You tend to think more on first principles. Processing speed also feels increased.

Noopept also beat my expectations for something apparently so mundane compared to everything else in my stack but it's definitely 2 to 3 tiers below those two. Anxiolysis, memory, and irritability.

I liked Suni as well but somehow I never took it for more than 3 days a time or so. 4 DMA 7 8 DHF was great at first and then irritability kind of set in.

Dihexa ... not sure what to think of it. I took some of it post-infection and I think it helped with anxiety but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

Low-dosing LSD helped a bit but didn't stick to it.

Also take Lion's Mane regularly. Appreciate the anxiolysis.

Haven't tried Cortexin but I would be willing for sure. Cerebrolysin beat my expectations by a very sizeable margin. 

For the OP and everyone else that ends up reading this:

I was in a very low place just 9 months ago - absolutely no hope I would ever be able to recover. Now, I couldn't be more content with the way I'm able to casually enjoy life and experience feeling alive. I'm 36 and I feel like I have the very best parts of my teen brain back - days take forever to pass and I enjoy every second of them. The simple joyous experience of sitting down and relax to watch a movie is enough for me to call it a very good day. I also enjoy people far more and I used to be a very reclusive individual. I'm grateful.

I wish the OP nothing but the best. 

Hope this helps",1678999659,jchbhnp,t3_11s9h19,t1_jcg4b0l,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"Hey, that's awesome to hear! I'm on NSI-189 right now. It's absolutely one of my favorite substances of all time. Cerebrolysin was great, too. I switched to Cortexin for the cost benefits, and it's been just as good, maybe a bit more potent, actually. I've been meaning to get my hands on more TAK-653. I bought into the first batch released on everychem.

I definitely noticed the benefits to introspection. Actually, I'd like to run it long-term just because I'm curious as to how that boost to introspection will compound in the long run. I also found myself laughing more while on it? I'll really have to try it again and see.

Anyways, NSI-189 really is fantastic. I feel child-like, as you've said. More playful, more imaginative. I guess you could say the world feels a bit more like a studio Ghibli film (to say nothing of actually watching a studio Ghibli film on it). The boost to emotionality helps me process emotions and feel more human, as well.

I'm probably gonna stay on this stuff for as long as I can, because it really just makes me a better person overall. Thanks for the reply, by the way. Sounds like we're in a similar place in life in regards to being happy every day. It's kind of felt like a 'happy ever after' every day for a while now. Only difference being I'm twelve years younger than you, so maybe not at the 'ever after' part yet, lol",1679000257,jchd109,t3_11s9h19,t1_jchbhnp,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

ScienceWins_87,"No, thank you. It was my absolute pleasure to read your reply. 

We definitely share a very deep appreciation and love for NSI-189. I just got off of a 9 hour work stretch and I could use something outside the heavy grind.

I used NSI on and off for 5 years in a row.  Upwards of 12 grams. I too used to think it was for life and still do in a very significant way. I have 5 grams near me just in case. It's just that with COVID I felt there were more things in need of repair than what NSI-189 can cover. Also, the child-like aspect of it is actually something I have to be mindful of because it does get in the way I relate to others at work and I end up paying for it - it took me years to understand that. What I gained with it - the charisma, the willingness to put myself in the open, and the creativity I paid for with the inability to fully emotionally process and accept things in my work life. I also paid for its almost paradoxical effects. I remember this guy's account here in reddit telling NSI-189 fixing depression feels like something akin to simply feeling your mind growing stronger rather liking itself. I can relate to that. Some of the most DGAF dispassionate Thanos moments I've had were on it. That's very likely what I will get if I take it now. Absolute economy of words and a need to succeed.

In any case, it's a very interesting substance and it does tend to register in your mind as weird and magical as opposed to many others.

24 is absolutely great dude, enjoy it.",1679012917,jci7o1m,t3_11s9h19,t1_jchd109,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ScienceWins_87,"I am not sure how much this will help. I want to be conservative and explain what I felt. I've tried a lot of things and people really tend to exaggerate over the internet. May you try a lot of things and know how to separate the wheat from the chaff.

My TAK experience really mirrors the anecdotes being relayed in this sub. I believe there is little to no bullshit being reported on TAK.

In my case, it basically increased my ability to be introspective.

First time I tried it I wasn't expecting anything at all but by day 3 or 4 of taking 2mg there was simply no way I could avoid the psychoactive effect. It was in my face, messing with the fabric of my mood and thoughts. I stopped taking it because I wanted to make room for Cerebrolysin but it's something i wouldn't mind trying for extended periods of time to see what else can come out of it. It can be a bit unhinged and uncomfortable - i definitely feel a bit wired on it - but I think there is room to think it might be doing some good with the BDNF increase.

I adored SEMAX. The last time I took it was in 2017. 

It's weird/hard for me to explain the differences between one another as similarities are definitely there but I find SEMAX to feel more like a healing experience and TAK as a straight stimulant of sorts. 

I would love to have both to be honest. I miss SEMAX. 

It honestly depends on what your looking for and what you think you need to fix/augment. My honest recommendation would be for you to get the money and try both. I can't separate them in a way that helps you. They were both very valuable to me. I tend to favor a kitchen sink approach to things - just (reasonably) throw everything that might help at your brain if your suffering from something.",1679703225,jdk8vyl,t3_11s9h19,t1_jcvxx7k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
