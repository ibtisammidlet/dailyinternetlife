1Reaper2,"You need to use an irreversible MAOI or Armodafanil. They’re the only things that are comparable to amphetamines. Both will last longer.

MAOI is likely better for GAD but is subject to blood pressure changes. Take a look at the MAOI subreddit and Dr. Gillmans website. He is a decent source of info on MAOIs and has resources to help actually get a prescription as it can be difficult.

Nsi-189 response seems somewhat typical apart from the pain. I agree with your decision to stop.

Would also consider looking at basic health and nutritional markers via blood testing. See if you can find anything off, try fixing it and see what happens.",1697200166,k4p4blb,t3_176w6zc,t3_176w6zc,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
Double_Round_8103,"I struggled with anhedonia for 8 years. What I discovered fixed it was testosterone. Like injecting testosterone. I went to the gym and took testosterone to put on muscle and I was damn surprised how all the emotional numbness disappeared, way more out going, enjoy people, enjoy life, actually attracted to women again. I now permanently inject testosterone in low doses.

It's interesting because there is decent research showing anhedonia is strongly associated with low testosterone. Nothing else has even come close to working like testosterone did.",1697218871,k4qgggx,t3_176w6zc,t3_176w6zc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Maerkab,"I have a similar mental health situation as you and nootropics haven't done anything significant for me no matter how many I tried, or how much money I spent, or how intentionally I tried to target dopaminergic function, etc. I can't speak for everyone but I just don't think they're strong enough for moderate to severe depression or anhedonia. Amphetamine (Vyvanse) lead to the most significant remission by far but I really didn't like the idea of having to make a stimulant have to do so much heavy lifting where depression and anhedonia are concerned. If it were purely ADHD/motivational issues then the relatively short duration/coverage wouldn't have been such an issue, but the daily cycle or rollercoaster of beginning the day in a really low mood, feeling better with the pill kicking in, and possibly a bit of a crash later on, began to get pretty exhausting and worrying despite the significant benefits.

It looks like I'll be trying Parnate in the future and I'm hoping that will address the weaknesses or downsides of stimulant medication for these conditions but I apparently have months wait in an unmedicated state to get into seeing my psychiatrist to begin the process, so it feels pretty hard to maintain optimism for a prospective medication, even though at this moment this medication seems to be my best bet of the things I haven't tried yet.",1697238530,k4rv2jk,t3_176w6zc,t3_176w6zc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
GlitteringAirport938,"If I was you, I would stop looking at things that manipulate your brain, and instead focus on your overall health. People forget the brain operates within the human body. This means that if you blood sugar is really low, you'll get anhedonia that won't be fixed by any drug, only proper nutrition will help. Similarly, if one of your hormones like testosterone or cortisol are out of whack, you might get anhedonia that will only be fixed by normalizing those levels. I guess what I'm trying to say is try to go down that avenue, try to not just diagnose your brain itself, but your body as a whole and how it can be affecting your brain ls function. 

You'd be amazed how many people's mental health issues are entirely fueled by overall health issues. People who separate mind and body tend to take much longer to figure out why their brains aren't working properly.",1697237838,k4rtia0,t3_176w6zc,t3_176w6zc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Take a look at this: https://youtu.be/vJ8b-DoKYAU?si=cqeqtjNO9iLjG7ux
I don’t endorse the exact protocol (though it worked well for me) but the approach is fundamentally centered around sensitization rather than modulation or cramming in as much catelochomines as possible (I love MAOIs and stims don’t get me wrong). 
To me that’s really how to fix the root cause of the issue rather than covering it up with more dopaminergics, but that’s easier said than done.

1Reaper2,"No worries.

Lamotrigine has shown efficacy in autism.

MAOIs are hard to get anywhere. Use the Dr. Gillman letter from his website. Send it to your doctor. 

Nardil is the better choice.

9-me-bc has not been studied sufficiently to know if its safe for long term use. It shows promise for changing dopamine receptor sensitivity but this may not be a desirable change for long term brain health as you would be cranking up oxidative stress if your using stimulants alongside it to treat ADHD. 

Its a weak MAOI compared to Parnate and Nardil, and comes with some other side effects like light sensitivity which we don’t know much about. How will this effect our eyes over the long run? Many unanswered questions.

In short, try lamotrigine if you struggle with main autism symptoms, then try get a prescription for Nardil. I don’t recommend self medicating with something like Autism.",1697403458,k510puj,t3_176w6zc,t1_k50kygp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
