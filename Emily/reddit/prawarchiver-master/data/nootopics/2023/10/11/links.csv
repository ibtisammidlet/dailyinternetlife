Risks is less important im basically ok with any risks almost anyways but im not su1cidal yet(sry for being a crybaby) i just NEED to stark functioning asap.

Did have ritalin and after that vyvanse, latter worked awesome obviously but it triggers my addiction when it wears of, and i start to feel like crap again 

Im 26yo sober amphetamine/opioid addict on buprenorfine. 

I have ADHD(extremely inattentive) and probably autism(looking into that rn with psychologist)

I just want to feel ok, i have had anxiety since age 10 at least and depression since 13. Especially anhedonia which is by far the worst of my symptoms, and the reason i fell hard for amphetamine.

Tried like close to 100 nootropics among them semax, selank, bromantane(not for long enough i relapsed and lost it somewhere sadly) 

Only one that i felt working was nsi-189 but it was in a very bad way. I had lots of neck and back pain and anxiety got worse. Could this have been a sign i should have kept going?

Also pdychadelics was amazing both low dose  and micro, last micro dose got me interested in meditation which has saved my life in a way, wouldnt be sober now without it.

Other diagnoses:
Body dysmorphia
GAD
social anxiety
Panic anxiety
Have had what might be hypomanic episodes, before addiction started, however nothing much",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Any anhedonic here who managed to do more than ""kind of ease"" their suffering?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/176w6zc/any_anhedonic_here_who_managed_to_do_more_than/
