Chelydraserpentina,"I've been taking about 30 mg noopept and 500 mg centrophenoxine for a couple of decades, along with a raetam and sulbutiamine. Always worked well for me and no bad side effects. If cetrophenoxine was more available, i'd go back to a gram a day in the morning but I can't source the powder anymore, just capsules.",1698775054,k79brvp,t3_179g3v5,t3_179g3v5,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

insidethegod,"I've stuck to daily dose of 10mg noopept for years with good results. For a time I stacked it with 250mg of centrophenoxine (about 3x a week) and felt great. On the occasions I took larger doses of noopept it made me feel terribly agitated as a baseline. When I took centro everyday, I also felt agitated and ran into feelings of depression.  
As entavias noted, they both affect cholinergic activity so it's probably best to experiment with the lowest dose possible that provides the desired effect.  
That said, I'm having a hard time finding a reputable source for centrophenoxine and capsules would be just fine by me.   
Chelydraserpintina, could you point me in the right direction?",1700031022,k9brbsr,t3_179g3v5,t1_k79brvp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
