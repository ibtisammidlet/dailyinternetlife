Fearless_Climate4612,"So, as an old dude that's been through a gambit of psych meds..I've found a majority are extremely hit or miss..sometimes providing some minimal relief or worse..negative side effects..biggest being the increase in symptoms of depression or said psychological issue. This will sound stupid easy and if works for you..You'll be passed your doc didn't tell you about it..but, have you given any consideration to Magnesium supplements..?? You can legit Google it..multiple double blind studies using different types of Magnesium have proven to improve overall well being at around 4 weeks..I know..4 weeks is a lifetime while your amidst a flair up..personally found Magnesium Taurate 400mgs 2 capsules twice daily..along with a few others..passion flower and valerian root can help ground the mind. Along w L-theanine and some good omega 3s. I've personally had more growth and overall peace of mind and soul since began this regime. I also started doing yoga bout 2 yrs ago..along w meditation and breath work..it's a game changer..I can say wholeheartedly I want to live today..not something I would've thought even possible just a couple yrs ago.",1697473211,k54snwr,t3_179463v,t3_179463v,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Seems it can cause a Parkinson's mimicking syndrome, the prognosis of which I'm completely unaware. We're you taking anything else at the time? Lamictal maybe?


What did your Dr say about these issues? Presuming your Dr has been either dismissive, generally unhelpful, or both, I'll remind you to push hard to advocate for yourself. They're not the only Dr out there either.

""Aripiprazole, like other atypical antipsychotics, displays antagonistic action at serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptors. However, it differs from other antipsychotics in that it is a partial agonist at dopamine-2 receptors and 5-HT1A receptors.2 Both cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of aripiprazole to its main metabolite dehydroaripiprazole.""",1697460776,k53xtl6,t3_179463v,t3_179463v,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

At least he now recognizes this problem. And I think it is precisely this the reason why doctors are pushing injections as that medicine is for such people who have tendence to drop taking it due of their mood swings.
