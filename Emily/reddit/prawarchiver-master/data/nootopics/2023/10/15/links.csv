So my question is what could be the reason for this? And why two is the same for 2 different compounds that has almost nothing in common?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Noopept and Centrophenoxine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/179g3v5/noopept_and_centrophenoxine/

I am new to nootropics and I was wondering if anyone has ADHD and have done a deep dive into what nootropics help the most. I am about to sit for a 5 hour long certification exam in 2 weeks. I know some nootropics need to be consumed for about a month to really show effects, but what has worked best for you? I will be taking it along side of my Adderall prescription.

polgesteirg,1697465870,self.NooTopics,179714k,True,7,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/179714k/critique_my_asd_stack/,1709901286,8,"I recently started researching what creates certain pathologies in autism and trying some things. I concluded most of my issues (anxiety, sensory issues, overstimulation, sleep problems caused by the previous, etc.) largely result from nmda hypofunction which leads to too much glutamate. I’ve also found that simply taking gabaergics only “masks” the problem and doesn’t truly do anything to address the core issues. True nmda receptor antagonists such as memantine do. Memantine has by far been the most effective thing to instantly and convincingly treat the underlying anxiety that I believe fuels every other autistic problem.

I won’t go too much into the details of how I came to this conclusion. It was a lot of trial and error, looking at research and anecdotal experiences to pattern match, seeing if effects from certain nootropics/supps I took lined up with the theory, and modifying it as needed. Of course Im open to any criticism and might be wrong about some things or missing info, but I believe my conclusions so far have been accurate, at least for my case.

I don’t want to rely on just memantine though. I actually don’t know if it’s sustainable long term or how it’s half life works very well, looking to understand that more. I also want to heal my brain in other ways such as making sure to have proper glutathione, improving methylation, and perhaps in the future experimenting with micro dosing “harder” substances like psychedelics for longer lasting neuroplasticity. That being said this is the stack I came up with: 
- 10-20mg memantine every 2-3 days for nmda antagonism/regulation 

- plenty of broccoli, chocolate, and curcumin for glutathione and anti oxidant
 
- glutathione (not sure the dosage yet, probably 500mg) 

- l-theanine for high-stress situations where I can also use being slightly stimulated 

Other things I’m considering:
- NAC: I’ve taken this in the past, but it made me anhedonic and emotionally blunted. Im not sure if fixing other things will make this a more viable option 

- bromantate: more brain  relaxing than phenibut, lavender oil, theanine… p much every other gabaergic I’ve taken. Relaxes my mind even more than kratom

- racetams (Piracetam, noopept, and aniracetam) and cholinergics like alpha GPC: I’m still not very sure how these interact with everything else. I feel like I learn better on these but I’m afraid they might contribute to glutamate toxicity as well

- 5-htp and it’s alternatives: I know 5-tho is not sustainable long term. I’m honestly quite ignorant on how serotonin affects autism. I’ve read that autisitcs have very high levels, but taking these makes me feel more at peace, motivated, and helps me enjoy things such as talking to people and feel more emotional. 

- And finally, Yerba matte: I was trying so hard to find a substitute for caffeine and this seems promising. Would this be advisable, or perhaps there is anything better?

Sorry if it got a bit too long. I feel like the pieces are coming together and wanted to hopefully discuss my knowledge and theories with other people. Any thoughts?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Critique my ASD stack,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/179714k/critique_my_asd_stack/
