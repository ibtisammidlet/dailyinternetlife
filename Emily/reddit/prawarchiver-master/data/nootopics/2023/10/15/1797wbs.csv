Bierak,"I have Sunifiram from Powdercity ðŸ˜† I have it in the refrigerator so I think it Is well preserved.
About potency: always good, 0.1 MG feels excellent.
Only problem with Sunifiram Is the lacks of studies about safety, but Is one of the best nootropics out there",1697534421,k58i36t,t3_1797wbs,t3_1797wbs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"I lost a lot of weight on it. Although it was very stim like it had some nootropic value but it seems to be to big of a risk vs reward I canâ€™t remember the other version which was apparently safer and sunifiram is a dirty analog of oh yeah itâ€™s UNIFIRAM granted I never took uni but I would seek that out over aunifiram I only included the weight loss to point out how close to a stim it is.

Edit I Have tired uni I just was having a brain shit",1697593346,k5cfkv5,t3_1797wbs,t3_1797wbs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Righteous_Fury,"Never ever EVER combine it with modafinil or related stimulants.  Can result in persistent headaches and odd cognitive effects that took months to go away.

That's the only nootropic that ""damaged me"". I was using modafinil and some Adderall at the time.  

My memory was improved.  Most notably, I could get super drunk and/or high, and have UNBELIEVABLY good verbal fluency.  But eventually everything started sounding too loud. It's like the combo slowly turned up the gain on my brain.",1697817633,k5pew3i,t3_1797wbs,t3_1797wbs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
bostocked,I would imagine so if it came in one of those moisture absorbent double storage containers... never got around to trying it but was quite Interested in it when I was 15. Apparently if dosed too high may cause headaches if I remember correctly so be careful but let me know how you get on if you do!,1697480091,k55br2h,t3_1797wbs,t3_1797wbs,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,What effects do you observe from sunifiram? Yea I will have to go digging in the research about Sunifiram about its safety if I get a chance.,1697578238,k5bem21,t3_1797wbs,t1_k58i36t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,"Haha, I wonder if you are actually taking sunifiram? Maybe its mislabeled by the vendor. Which vendor did you get it from?

Unifiram works a lot better for focus & flow-state for me. Sunifiram is less noticeable and kinda works in the background, such that I'd notice the same kind of effect but only after reflecting over my day.

So basically I'm saying that unifiram is more in my face with its nootropic effects.",1697593868,k5cgtgq,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5cfkv5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,"Yea I get more irritated easily on it. So I stopped it for now (the sunifiram).

So far I'd say that unifiram is a lot better & useful in my experience.",1697835560,k5qrc5t,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5pew3i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

TheReviewNinja,"Yea I used and still have some unifiram and sunifiram I bought like 1-3 years ago from Science bio before they closed & re opened.

I'm not sure about sunifiram, but I get a very strong hyper focus on unifiram. Makes a huge difference for studying. When I use it I get a tight feeling sometimes in my head and I just keep going when normally I would have given up.

I'll try some more of my sunifiram today & let you know.",1697480405,k55cm1q,t3_1797wbs,t1_k55br2h,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,"Hmmm I think I felt the same actually now that you mentioned it. And futher processing of the time I took it made me reflect I was stacking with adrafinil everyday. Never experienced excitotoxicity even with noopept I got mine I canâ€™t remember bionootropics or umbrella labs

EditBut either way it felt like a stim: I read somewhere it is converted into piperazine but UNI was I thought more in the back ground. My gf tired it also and was like if that is related to piracetam then that piracetam did crack hahah thatâ€™s what she said.

Also it may have been science.bio Iâ€™ve since. Thrown it out",1697643792,k5ez8tn,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5cgtgq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
bostocked,Wicked! How much of that focus gets pushed across to long term storage would you say?? Or is it more of a present day get through stuff sort of tool!,1697480518,k55cx4a,t3_1797wbs,t1_k55cm1q,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,"Actually you might be right about the stim part- I noticed that I was sweating more than usual despite the cold outside while walking. It may be dose dependent.

Oh, why'd you throw it out?",1697664366,k5gkpmk,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5ez8tn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,"It's like a more effective learning session with increased engagement. The retention of the information & It's comprehensive is improved.

In general for long term storage, you need to practice spaced repetition to really engrain the information.

TheReviewNinja,"Remember, its a research chemical so there's a risk. At least Noopept passes as a common pharmaceutical in Russia. Have you tried noopept before?",1697503617,k571el7,t3_1797wbs,t1_k55stak,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Noopept in my opinion is way cleaner nicer but I combined the two it helped sunifiram but also had a shitty comedow,1697593390,k5cfoin,t3_1797wbs,t1_k571el7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheReviewNinja,"That's interesting, I don't notice any comedown on sunifiram. But my memory/recall is surprisingly better. What dosage are you taking?",1697593723,k5cggoy,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5cfoin,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,I think it was extremely low ~5mg sublingual I only noticed the comedown with combining it with something besides adrafinil,1697644070,k5f00iv,t3_1797wbs,t1_k5cggoy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
