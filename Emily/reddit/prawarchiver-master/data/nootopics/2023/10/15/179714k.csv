antiepoch,"You need to go read some review papers on what pharmaceutical drugs are being used to treat ASD in the last 1-3 years. The key here is REVIEW where they analyze a bunch of studies together examining both the study quality and any effect size. Then, extrapolate from there.

Some of this isn’t totally out to lunch (l-theanine) and some of it is (5htp) for someone autistic.

polgesteirg,That’s quite a long list! Thanks.  I’ll check it out,1697546203,k590hic,t3_179714k,t1_k54w1c0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
polgesteirg,"From what I’ve read, they still use things like anti psychotics that cause terrible sides. And just to control outward behavior like stimming (so neurotypical can like them more lol) but I haven’t seen much quality of life treatments that actually attempt to fix underlying issues. The most novel I’ve seen is using things like thc and cbd oil to help with anxiety and sleep. I’m not sure if I’m up to date with the literature, but it doesn’t seem great. They do know that there are gaba-glutamate imbalances but I don’t know what they’re prescribing up to date. Do you have anywhere to start?",1697476909,k552x68,t3_179714k,t1_k54ctll,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
polgesteirg,A quick search said it increases glutamate and decreases gaba a. Wouldn’t that be the last thing you’d want?,1697477424,k554c18,t3_179714k,t1_k54mgun,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
santaclaws35,Hey so I’m confused why you would supplement with gluthathione ? Wouldn’t that raise glutamate ? I’m trying to learn all this bc I took have hyper sensitivity and autistic traits that are very uncomfortable and I theorize I have ab issue with gaba.
