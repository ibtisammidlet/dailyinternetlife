antiepoch,"I’m so sorry that all of the replies to you are unhelpful, OP. “Just get another doctor” and “there must be a reason that you aren’t telling us” are the kind of replies that show a blatant lack of understanding of the kinds of biases that are built into the healthcare system and the people in it for folks who have ADHD. Sadly, many doctors simply won’t prescribe stimulants because they still think of them as a one-way ticket to addiction - meanwhile the research overwhelmingly shows that when folks are treated for their ADHD they are the least likely to abuse ANY substance. Many doctors are also feeling the DEA prescribing limits crackdown, IMHO. My partner had a new psych take her off her meds and argue about her last diagnosis in the first visit, it was wild. We can’t explain it any other way, because it’s not like this doctor has said she doesn’t believe in using stimulant meds. It was “nah, I’ve undiagnosed you” - like what?

I’ve never misused my meds and I am petrified of asking for shorter acting dexamphetamine instead of a vyvanse next time I go in, since I find vyvanse is like one bump in the morning and then a long tail of mehhhh and bad sleep later on. I’d like to be able to only take it as I need it - I might end up taking less than the 30mg a day I currently take, IMHO. My provider never has given me reason to think she doesn’t trust me, but many others before her have, with zero reason for it. 

In the meantime, consider:

- Skullcap, eg bacalein
- Bromantane
- some folks get mild to medium results precursor loading with L-tyrosine and/or L-phenylalanine combined with caffeine
- Bupropion prescription 
- Strattera prescription
- Guanfacine prescription 
- Clonidine prescription 

I’ve had some success with Bupropion, but not so much anymore, still debugging that. It can really potentiate the Vyvanse once you get back on it, be careful.

I love clonidine because it calms the “restless mind” but it’s usually not enough on its own without stimulants for me.

MadScientistRat,"You've never explained the reason for why or the means of how your new doctor repudiated prescribing you any stimulants. Please describe or edit.

There's always a reason. And like the saying goes there's always two faces to any reason given: the good reason and the real reason.

Is your psych the anti-stimulant anti-controlled substances type that only prescribes medication to stay off the DEA radar who told you that you don't need stimulants the good reason, but the real reason is that she has been recently been flagged by for over prescribing or is the underprescribing type?

Since you repeatedly disclaim in your disclosures about not being the drug abuser type with so much emphasis, one flag. Is it red or pure? Did you give off any vibes (appearance, manner of expression, previous history) that would give rise to the belief that you made potentially, potentially fall under the potential mis-user category error bias? Do you or any of your relatives have have any prior history of substance abuse or did you make any disclosures in any application or revelations of the like to any previous providers which she could have accessed through health information exchange networks? 

Right now there's a undercurrent of Mass Health surveillance that most people are not aware that's brewing for a congressional hearing on how your health data is being collected, compiled and and freely disseminated without any restrictions in the same way that you're browsing history and the sites you visited were all tracked by cookies and secretly bought and sold and compiled in massive databases essentially revealing more than even your ISP could in a massive intrusion, raping, selling and collection and meat marketing of your privacy called HIEs or health information exchanges. If you have ever signed any forms authorizing your health information to be shared under the fine print guise of a HIPAA release form, or live in an ""opt-out"" state where you would never made aware that your health information would be freely disseminated and released, tagged categorized shared exchanged and sold by in between these networks and made accessible to anybody that subscribed to them, including your dentist, and that may be the reason.

All of your previous protected health information and history down to the very detail is bought and sold by health information clearinghouses/networks HINs and is accessible to any provider that you see that automatically subscribes to these data sharing companies which are automatically propagated into their electronic health record terminals EHRs, including your veterinarian. So if there's anything in your history that would make any provider reluctant to prescribe you stimulants for any real or good reason, and that may be why. And you need to fight back and call back all erroneously propagated PHI that was really shared in disseminated without any restrictions and without your knowledge or consent.",1698036150,k62e2tu,t3_17e8hsr,t3_17e8hsr,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sispants,"Yeah, realized after posting that comment that it sounded like the doc wouldn’t budge even with that info. Definitely going to be a case of needing to find a new doc :/ 

A few thoughts…
- Vyvanse generic is now available (the original patent expired in August), so you may be able to get it more affordably once you get an Rx for it.

- If you have medical records showing you were prescribed it in the past, I would think a PCP would be willing to prescribe it regardless of the gap in having an Rx for it (particularly since it’s considered to be less abused than Adderall). It’s going to be quicker getting in to see a PCP than another Psych. A PCP writing your Lexapro and other med Rx’s will also be cheaper in the long run than getting it from a Psych since the latter usually charge more for visits. 

- Ideally whatever records you can provide the a new PCP or Psych include the formal diagnosis, but I don’t know if that’s completely necessary. I don’t believe my current PCP has records of my formal diagnosis on file for ADHD (not even sure where that record resides), but I did need to provide the medical records from my former Psych showing that it was prescribed to me before my PCP would write me an Rx to resume my Adderall.

Edit: Another comment here mentioned Bupropion/Wellbutrin. That anti-depressant is often prescribed for people who have both Depression and ADHD as it has some focus-improving components to it. But it prob can’t fully replace a stimulant med if your ADHD is severe. I’d also hedge away from replacing your Lexapro if it’s still working for you, at least until you’re in a more stable place with the ADHD.

Regarding all the above, do want to make it clear I’m not a doctor, and these are mainly anecdotal thoughts from my own and friends’ experiences with getting treatment for depression and ADHD. Hope they help.",1698118530,k67cw5b,t3_17e8hsr,t1_k67a0p5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MadScientistRat,"What is preventing you from changing a psychiatrist? Or going to a neurologist instead?

If you're as morally corrupt and rationally bankrupt as I am, go study and feighn the symptoms of EDS/DSPD and Narcolepsy and you'll be prescribed double dose by a neurologist. Just keep going to one after the other tell them that you're having symptoms of narcolepsy and you're only responsive to stimulants and you have a feeling of fall asleep behind the wheel one day and mow down a school of kindergarteners asleep behind the wheel ine day if you don't have your medication.

Instead of typing up a storm and clogging up the comment docket just research the compound and the mechanism of action if you are a new traffic lab rat enthusiast 9MeBc is a REVERSIBLE MAOI B inhibitor so it should not be taken together with stimulants although it could not advised but you have to deeply research the risks and or verify the subject matter expertise and competency of those who have already done so, and take a consensus assessment, and buy it from a reliable source and done.

This one is a very tricky synthesis and shy of a neurotoxin if not procured from a Tier 1 vendor. So do not be cheap on this (you'll understand after reading its MOA). The consensus now: Tier 1 [Science.bio](https://Science.bio) , SwissChems, NewMind. I have a close post-grad Chemistry PhD friend that's a TA at major state public research university with access cutting-edge spectroscopy beyond HLPC who confirmed all three sources' spectral wavelength peaks we're on part in cross-sample confirmation and purity.

9-Me-Bc has a favorable solubility in in EtOH (buy lab grade on Amazon, but Everclear proof is fine) and ideally prepare stable solution with PEG400. For 300mg 9-Me-Bc stable dropper solution in a 30mL bottle for 10mg/mL dose under tongue, you could get away with just volumetrically measuring 300mg bioactive agent in PEG400 but save yourself the trouble and get a lab vortex mixer (less hassle and evil) mixed until in solution temperature NTE 40C. For enhanced bioavailability, simple beta-cyclodextrin conjugated solution would make the most economic sense. But due to Ethanol content you'd have to make a bigger dilute 100 mL stock solution. Heat 70 mL of PEG400 to 30C and stir while adding 1,200 mg HP-Beta-Cyclodextrin (Amazon) for a few minutes until clear in Stock A. Then 1,000mg of 9 Me Bc in 10mL of Ethanol with 20mL Deionized water in Stock B. Ethanol (or Everclear). Then slowly combine both and the 9-Me-Bc with conjugate with Cyclodextrin solution until clear. Cyclodextrins are cheap bioavailability enhancers as extracellular vesicles encapsulating the 9-Me-Be as a drug delivery inclusion matrix to enhance BOA and most importantly BBB permeation. Since less than 2% of psychoactive compounds in the bloodstream permeate the very selective tight junctions of the BBB, requiring less dosage of the API to reach the target site.

They make you feel exactly the same except that adderall gets your heart going worse if you take too much. Thats because its a mixed salt including l-isomer, which is harder on your body. Meth if taken in similar strength portions is a safer alternative imo. I used to wrap up measured doses of crystal in a piece of paper and take it like a pill, ""parachuting it"". I was the only person I knew who took it that way.*

Amphetamine and its derivatives are known to cause increased production of hydroxyl radical (•OH) in the brain (Huang et al., 1997; Wan et al., 2000a) resulting in acute striatal DA and serotonin depletion (Kita et al., 1999; Shankaran et al., 1999). It has also been shown to induce neurodegeneration in animals (Wan et al., 2000b; Jeng et al., 2006).

I just made you look dumb. And your last statement was particularly dumb and nerdy because if one takes a substance and it makes he/she feel bad, it's reasonable to assume that it's toxic.",1700139810,k9husb6,t3_17e8hsr,t1_k62pt6x,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
