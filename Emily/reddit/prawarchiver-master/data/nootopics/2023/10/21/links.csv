Saw a psychiatrist for years who prescribed me Vyvanse. Lost my insurance and couldn't afford it. Ended up switching to a PCP who wrote my other couple of medications with no issues. I never requested Vyvanse due to cost. Still no insurance. PCP moved without any prior notice to me. 

Figured I needed to get back to a psychiatrist and try alternatives. She was the first Dr I could get into see before running out of my Lexapro. My now untreated ADHD has gotten so bad it's affecting my entire life, especially my job. 

While taking Vyvanse as prescribed, never abused, I always got my job done easily and could help others as well. I need a stimulate (again, not a drug abuser, although I don't judge anyone) that will help with mood boost and energy. It's the only way I feel ""normal"". I've tried the non stimulate ones with no results. 

Willing to try anything to help. It's making my depression worse bc I constantly worry about messing up. 

On a budget so I'd like to be able to find one to two things to help. Sites and name brands would really help me. I've done so many searches for weeks and can't decide what to get. Can't afford to keep trying things that do not work at all. 

Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: Forced to change drs, new one will not prescribe Vyvanse, that was prescribed when I had insurance. Looking for one to two things to take to help with mood and energy.
