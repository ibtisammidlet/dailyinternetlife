Legitimate_Banana512,">Could bromantane potentially cause negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia, and might micro-dosing LSD also act as a trigger? 

Yes, potentially. There is a link between increased dopamine to schizophrenia symptoms.

Acid I'm not sure, there is a direct link between 5-htp2a but I don't know good or bad.

I just read this study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8123139/

Looks like you'd benefit from something like neboglamine (NMDA-PAM), Fasoracetam/other racetams (metatrobic glutamate agonist), and some Gaba-a agonist.. Like most flavanoids antioxidants are",1698156826,k692eq7,t3_17fb1gy,t3_17fb1gy,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Anything what increases dopamine may increase schizophrenia risk in those very few people who are prone to it. But of course common intoxicants such as booze and weed are more problematic, let alone stimulants. Generally antipsychotic medications block dopamine binding so symmetrically opposite. Dont do anything too dopaminergic if you are prone to schizophrenia or psychosis - instead there may be some noots which could balance that a bit.",1698838240,k7co4xl,t3_17fb1gy,t3_17fb1gy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
