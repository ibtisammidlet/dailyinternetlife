Complete_Still7584,"I'm going to tell you what I did to reverse tolerance using NMDA antagonists. I'm trying to get off 20mg of Suboxone of which I've been on for 2.5 years. That being said I've been ""sober"" from my drugs of choice benzodiazepines, meth, and fentanyl for 2.5 years. All of my symptoms following the brain and CNS damage from drugs started to improve and the dropped off at the 1.5 year mark. Opioids (Suboxone) are known to suppress neurotrophins and other neurotrophic and neurogenic endogenous compounds. I'm 22 years old. That being said those endogenous neurogenic compounds are needed for my brain to grow and mature. At the year and a half mark I got back on a stimulant for my ""ADHD""; but, I was really just so demotivated and depressed that I knew that would help me start to get my shit together again. As I've been on Adderall since I was 8. Again, symptoms started to improve but then dropped off. So, at that point I came to the conclusion that I needed to get off Suboxone. NMDA antagonists have shown to stop dependence development and reverse tolerance to MOST dependent causing substances ie. cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, and benzodiazepines. This is good for 2 reasons. One is I know for me to COMFORTABLY withdrawal; I need to take dependent causing medication. And two, if I can cause ENOUGH antagonism to the NMDA receptor, I can reverse tolerance which means I will get done with the withdrawal sooner, which means less trauma I have to work through later on. I've read every single study on NMDA antagonists used in opioid withdrawal. Dxm, memantine, and agmatine have all shown ""SLIGHT"" benefit but nothing clinically significant. All of those substances are easy to acquire and they're NON-COMPETITIVE NMDA antagonists. Once you've educated yourself with the NMDA receptor you'll find out that antagonism of the NMDA receptor results in agonism of the AMPA receptors which leads to significant increases in bdnf and other excitatory neurotransmitters. The ONLY ""safe"" AMPA agonist and only of it's kind is TAK-653. I've been having significant success with this stack. You have to make sure you follow these dosages exactly as they haven't published one study on the effects of stacking 2 NMDA antagonists let alone 3/4 and I've read EVERY anecdotal report and study on the dosages that have had success with opioid withdrawal. For DMX 30mg twice a day as the redditor posted is NOT enough. You have to dose it EXACTLY in the 70-75mg range. That being said I've been taking 1mg of TAK-653 in the am, 75mg of DXM in the am and then take it again 6 hours after taking the first dose, 5mg of Memantine in the am, and 2,000mg agmatine when i wake up usually 6:30am another 2,000 at 11:00am another 2,000 at 3:00pm and then another 2,000 at bedtime. I've also been using Delta Sleep Inducing Peptide when I go to bed which has been shown to act mainly through the NMDA receptors and surprisingly sometimes cause COMPLETE disappearance of ANY withdrawal symptoms after I take it and 30 min after I wake up. Everyday I'm lowering my dosages with opioids and am literally experiencing CONSTANT tolerance reduction not ONLY to opioids; but, also to my Vyvanse. If anyone has questions, reach out to me because I've been battling addiction my entire life and I feel as if I found the literal cure stack for addiction. Just an fyi, I'm also constantly using bromantane, cerebrolysin, and 9-me-bc on and off and have used all of the substances I've talked about in this text individually and feel as if I know what effect is from what substance.

CryptoEscape,"I tried to prevent it with DXM.

After a 3.5 year break from Amphetamine I was put back on meds.  But this time Methylphenidate as it caused less insomnia for me (it was ~80% as effective as Amphetamine, but short lived)

The magic was back.   For about a month I was super confident, witty, sharp, charismatic, etc.  I limited my use to 4-5 days a week and took 30 mg DXM 2x a day to try and maintain the magic.

Nope.  Now all it does is give me some energy and focus (which is really what’s it’s supposed to do.). 

The side effects are also getting worse, and I have comedowns.  Unfortunately my ADHD is so severe I need it to function.  

My days are just a mood roller coaster depending on how much medication is in or out of my system.  But I accept it as part of life.

That said maybe if you only took it twice a week, the DXM might help prevent tolerance.  Or like one week on, one - two weeks off.

But with near  daily use, DXM couldn’t even *prevent* tolerance (for me at least.) So I don’t think it could lower tolerance you already have.

9-me-bc is the only nootropic/supplement I’ve heard of that may actually lower tolerance.  It’s a weird, sketchy, potentially toxic, poorly studied, yet very interesting compound.  Oral bioavailability is said to be poor, sublingual and intranasal burn like crazy (to the point many people lose their sense of taste….as if food doesn’t already taste kinda bad when on a stimulant)

Otherwise you need an insanely long break (at least a year) and even then the magic only briefly comes back.

That said, DXM is cheap, potentially neuroprotective from stimulant toxicity, and probably safe…..it may be worth a try.  I still use it some days.",1698281021,k6h35kc,t3_17g25pn,t3_17g25pn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Thanks for sharing all this!

So by highlighting “NON COMPETITIVE”  are you emphasizing that they all work synergistically?  For example a weaker one like Agmatine, can’t compete and block the effects of a stronger one, like DXM?  It would essentially just add to it?

And wow 75 mg twice a day…..do you feel trippy or dissociated from that?  

I’ve tripped on DXM in the past, it was hella fun, but I was barely functional, forgetful, and walking + talking weird.  Even the lower doses (~100-150 mg) caused some of this.

I believe DXM and Memantine have some anti cholinergic properties as well, although more so at the nicotinic ones.  Did you notice any forgetfulness?

Interesting about how NMDA antagonism causes AMPA agonism….currently on an Oxiracetam cycle and was curious how NMDA antagonists interact with it.

Does the TAK actually contribute to the tolerance reduction too?  Or just saying it stacks well with NMDA antagonists?

How do you ingest  the 9-me-bc?  I have some, but hear the oral availability is questionable….sublingual works but causes severe burning and loss of taste.

Really appreciate this.  Congrats on your recovery.  

I’m a recovered addict too.  I got sober from alcohol and hard drugs, but still struggling with Kratom (which was basically a lesser evil that successfully helped me quit….but I take too much)",1698367061,k6m84tk,t3_17g25pn,t1_k6lf1wu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Complete_Still7584,30mg isn't enough for dxm in the first place let alone using it alone as an NMDA antagonist. If you're using DXM for it's NMDA antagonism; it has to be used in the 70-75mg twice a day. Once in the am and then 6 hours after your first dose. Please read the post I just made as I go into depth on using NMDA antagonists for tolerance reduction.,1698355219,k6lfjnh,t3_17g25pn,t1_k6h35kc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Complete_Still7584,"   Yes, this means they'll work synergistically. 75mg of DXM is the threshold dose. At this dose ONLY positive effects occur, such as a boost in appreciation of music, dopamine re-uptake, and a slight boost of energy. No trippy effects, I personally HATE dissociative and psychedelic drugs. 

   It's hard to say if the forgetfulness is caused by the drugs or the withdrawal as I always become disoriented, confused, and forgetful when withdrawing from any depressants.

   I believe TAK should contribute to tolerance reduction. I remember seeing a post by the expert on bromantane and substances such as this saying it helps with opioid detoxification. The positive effects from ketamine for depression is solely because of AMPA agonism. This is why TAK was made;). Which in my case the antidepressant effects of TAK is enough on its own. But, I do feel as if it helps with tolerance reduction.

   I started out 9-me-bc sublingually, switched to oral because of the causticness of it, but then switched back to sublingual as it's not even close to the benefits I get from it sublingually. After like 5-7 days of taking 30mg of 9-me-bc sublingually; I sometimes will literally feel as if I'm on Adderall 24/7 with no problems in the sleep department. This compound is by far one if not the most interesting compound I've ever tried in terms of positive effects with VERY few side effects in my experience.",1698438343,k6qauzx,t3_17g25pn,t1_k6m84tk,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Thanks for sharing bro.  Damn that 9-me-bc sounds worth the burn.  TAK def sounds worth it. 

2 more questions  though….I only take my stimulants 5 days a week…..should I still be taking the NMDA antagonists on the 2 days off? 

And will the Racetams counteract the NMDA antagonists?  I’ve read that Racetams can act as NMDA agonists….so not sure if they would counteract it?",1698525612,k6va1zv,t3_17g25pn,t1_k6qauzx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
