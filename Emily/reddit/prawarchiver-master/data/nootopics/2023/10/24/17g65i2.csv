ilovedoxo,What is the purpose you have for using this compound? Just curious,1698274464,k6gnb6d,t3_17g65i2,t3_17g65i2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
WiJoWi,"My seat of the pants says 6mg made me a little more resilient during my morning HIIT, but likely placebo.  Slept like shit before I took it, still slept like shit after I took it.  No changes to report.",1698312897,k6ilame,t3_17g65i2,t3_17g65i2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,Enhancing Complex I and IV. Because I think there likely could be made improvements on that with the help of indoles,1698287101,k6hhkm4,t3_17g65i2,t1_k6gnb6d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Appreciate your comment, but do you know about when you should time IPAM, like I asked in this post?

If you don't time it correctly than it might indeed leave you sleeping shitty. (Btw take 5-htp or tryptophan. Triptophan enhances IPAM, maybe 5-htp too. 5-htp helps a lot with sleep, IPAM isn't really meant for sleep primarily)",1698319062,k6iu9cq,t3_17g65i2,t1_k6ilame,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

WiJoWi,"I know, but speaking from personal experience, 6mg/day dosed about an hour prior to the gym did not seem to impact my sleep at all.  I don't have any hard science for you, just an anecdote.",1698334393,k6jti9f,t3_17g65i2,t1_k6iu9cq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,Because IPAM probably does a better job of it. Also IPAM  probably doesn't fuck with other systems as much as psychedelics like psylocybin does. I remember when I microdosed psylocybin I was overstimulated all the time,1698297333,k6i1391,t3_17g65i2,t1_k6i060p,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
