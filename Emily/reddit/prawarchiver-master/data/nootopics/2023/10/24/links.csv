I’m curious as to why this isn’t more prevalent, since all the reviews seem to compare it favorably to afanils (perhaps just astroturfing if thats what vendors were trying to push when it first came out?) It is related to bromantane in structure, however bio assay result’s available on pub chem were all inactive or inconclusive besides a water solubility test.

Out of the mentioned above I mainly focus on DHF, Semax, Sulbutiamine, Salidrosol (Rhodiola), SAMe and Cognance.

From what I have so far I’ve made some useful stacks the problem is a lot of what I have either needs to be used sparingly or doesn’t work well and I’m also just needing to try new stuff so I can say “i’ve tried everything for this purpose” even if I never get that 10/10 combo..
