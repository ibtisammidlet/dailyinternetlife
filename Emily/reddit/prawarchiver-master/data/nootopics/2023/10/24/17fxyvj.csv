Just tried Semax first time today, honestly less than I expected.

Sulbutiamine, long time ago, was alright.

Bobtropics,"Modafinil is pretty damn amazing for me when used sparingly.

I would also add 9-mbc to that list. I have had great results with it for energy, mood and motivation when used sublingually. It also potentiates other dopaminergics greatly, but tread carefully and do your homework. 

You won't find anything that will work consistently when taken every day, cycling stuff is the key. 

And even more important, optimize sleep, diet, supplements and workouts to support your baseline energy and proper metabolism. Otherwise all this stuff will just lead to a roller coaster of energy peaks and crashes.",1698231139,k6dl1u8,t3_17fxyvj,t3_17fxyvj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"From the list you've got, I would start with 7,8-DHF (I personally use and recommend 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF, it's more stimulating / motivating IMO), Semax, and polygala. I'm also liking ND's Saffron, but it's a newer add. 

4'-DMA-7,8-DHF and polygala are complementary, as poly mitigates TrkB downregulation from 4'-DMA (to what extent is anyone's guess, but they generally go well together).

Sulbutiamine is also decently stimulating and I enjoy it myself, but you'd likely need to cycle it to maintain effectiveness. Same goes for Salidrisol and/or Rhodiola. Great substances, but your body gets used to them.

I've tried Cistanche, Tribulus, and TK 2% from ND. None of them had much of an effect for me.",1698269661,k6gb983,t3_17fxyvj,t3_17fxyvj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Please avoid Adrafinil at all costs. There's really no reason to use it, as there are easily accessible moda and moda analogue vendors. It's a subpar Afinil and potentially hepatotoxic substance based on my own experience and research.

Personally, for regular usage I prefer armodafinil (generic Nuvigil). It produces a smoother and more predictable effect than moda IME, but ymmv.
