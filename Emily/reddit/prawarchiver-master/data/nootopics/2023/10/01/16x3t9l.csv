WhalesandCops,"I have some questions (just started my research journey)
Where you ever on pharmacy stimulantants? If yes how would you say it compares?
What side effects are you experiencing? (Negative or even just uncomfortable?)
How pricey was this?",1696192873,k31sq2g,t3_16x3t9l,t3_16x3t9l,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
wvkid101,What’s your stack like? Do you combine it with any stimulants?,1696256297,k355rj1,t3_16x3t9l,t3_16x3t9l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Drug-Nerd,Not as of now. Just bupropion and ALCAR. It is better than stimulants.,1696256575,k356gs5,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k355rj1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
wvkid101,"Interesting… I was thinking of trying amantadine before finally getting a MPH script. Was just too damn difficult to find a doc to Rx. 

Have you ever tried cabergoline?",1696256645,k356n99,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k356gs5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drug-Nerd,Yes. I have. But I was on antipsychotic back then which might have rendered it useless.,1696256792,k3570lk,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k356n99,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drug-Nerd,"To be honest, it seems to be a drug which might stop being easily available. I have been thinking about switching to memantine because of that reason.",1696256868,k3577no,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k356n99,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
wvkid101,"100%, especially if it was a typical one. Reason why I ask is that cabergoline made me manic beyond belief, but it did nuke the ADHD. 

If you want me tbh, I’m not even sure why amantadine is still on the market from a med standpoint. Doesn’t work for flu, and much better meds are available for Parkinsons.

Amantadine has those NMDA antagonist properties, but the effects it has at D2 are vital for cognitive effects. Memantine doesn’t have that to any meaningful capacity.",1696257179,k35807i,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k3577no,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"I just started memantine 5mg once a day and it has helped my adhd unbelievably

Edit I got it at sciencebio",1696260235,k35g1e0,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k3577no,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drug-Nerd,Exactly. Perhaps that's the reason it is indicated for ADHD and memantine isn't.,1696257399,k358kkz,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k35807i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drug-Nerd,That's great to hear.,1696260460,k35gniq,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k35g1e0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,I was interested in what your taking but I seem to be getting results from this I’m also stacking bromantane and I’ll be adding semax and possibly selank today.,1696260931,k35hwoc,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k35gniq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drug-Nerd,I take bupropion and ALCAR.,1696261048,k35i822,t3_16x3t9l,t1_k35hwoc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
