Read a few research articles saying ADHD-I types are more deficient in Norepinephrine and ADHD-H types Dopamine. My dopamine was fine till Adderall screwed it up. My Norepinephrine was the problem and even worse now. 

Any research in upregulating Norepinephrine pathways? I know Strattera is a NRI. But doesn't register much since Adderall damaged everything so much.  One concern is Strattera with Adderall will prevent NE pathways from repairing or upregulating.  Something that can help with repair long term while I attempt to heal and transition off adderall over the next year or 2 would be great. I know  NE is made from DA so upregulating Tyrosine Hydroxylase should help both.  And some pathways are shared and work on both NE and DA. So upregulating DA may help in shared pathways.

I am new to much of this info and not really familiar with how moderate to high prescription doses of amphetamine (30 to 60mg of Adderall) affect and may or may not damage AMPA related pathways.

Should also mention I am also taking modafinil/armodafinil, strattera, memantine, noopept,and a bunch of supplements. And some other drugs for course durations sometimes like mexidol, afobazole.

Currently have Bromantane. Sometimes take phenylpiracetam, sunifiram.

Ketamine improves depression through two mechanisms: first, it is a nmda antagonist which increases glutamate release in the hippocampus leading to more ampa activation, bdnf and finally mtor 1 which has positive effects on its own and retroactively activates nr2b in certain neurons over others which changes synaptic connections aka memories and can influence depression via that, the strengthing and weakening of various memories

Ketamine also contains a metabolite that is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor

Agmatine is a polyamine site of the nmda antagonist and this functionally negatively modulates synaptic nr2b which produces glutamate release again leading to a similar outcome

This is why I say it is very complicated and not easily explained by textbook chain of logic as you've presented - even by people like yourself who are very knowledgeable on the topic.  There is too much that we don't know to make broad assumptions.  And overconfidence is dangerous.

sirsadalot,"So there's multiple ways to explain the article you posted and none of them include the lack of involvement from mTOR, BDNF or AMPA. This is because genetic deletion of TrkB or TrkB antagonism abolishes the antidepressant effect of ketamine, and same with AMPA.

The first and most logical explanation is that the rapamycin dose was not enough to reverse the BDNF enhancement by ketamine. Rapamycin has a hard time getting into the brain. And while it may eventually accumulate and begin to inhibit mtor this would only counteract the bdnf plateau by ketamine, which may improve treatment. Note that the acute antidepressant effect of ketamine was not altered.

The second is that mtor induction plays an entourage effect with the other mechanisms I mentioned: serotonin promotion and nr2b induction.

no-google-no-cry,"I appreciate your detailed explanation and it indeed sheds light on the intricate biochemical interactions at play, particularly concerning ketamine's antidepressant effects. Your grasp on the mechanisms involving mTOR, BDNF, and NR2B is commendable. However, there are a few points where I think further clarification or evidence might be needed:

1. **Rapamycin Dose and BDNF Enhancement**:
    - The precise dosage of rapamycin and its efficacy in reversing BDNF enhancement by ketamine seems to be a complex issue. While the study we are discussing did administer rapamycin, the exact interplay between its dosage and BDNF enhancement wasn't fully elucidated. This leaves room for further investigation to understand the dose-dependent effects of rapamycin on BDNF enhancement by ketamine.

2. **mTOR Induction, Serotonin Promotion, and NR2B Induction (Entourage Effect)**:
    - The concept of an 'entourage effect' involving mTOR, serotonin, and NR2B is intriguing. While there is evidence showing individual interactions between these elements, the collective entourage effect as you suggested, isn't directly substantiated in the available literature. The interactions among serotonin, mTOR, and NR2B seem to be more nuanced and may require a more detailed exploration.

3. **Genetic Deletion of TrkB or TrkB Antagonism Abolishing Ketamine's Antidepressant Effect**:
    - This claim aligns well with established mechanisms and underscores the central role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in mediating ketamine's antidepressant effects.

Your hypothesis presents a well-argued understanding of the potential mechanisms, and I agree with much of what you've presented. However, the complexities of neurochemical interactions, as well as the sometimes unpredictable outcomes observed in pharmacological interventions, suggest a cautious approach in interpreting these mechanisms. The discussion indeed highlights the nuanced and sometimes elusive nature of neuropharmacology, and the need for continued research to unravel these intricacies. The field is ever-evolving, and discussions like these contribute to a broader understanding and hopefully, better therapeutic interventions in the future.",1698370883,k6mh6cy,t3_179gn1t,t1_k6m5vsh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
