Heavy-Individual7103,I've just started taking Bromantane and definitely noticed a decrease in anxiety.,1696356910,k3be4qy,t3_16ym564,t3_16ym564,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
CaveLegion,"Memantine sounds like the only one of the three you listed that could have a profound impact on your biggest issues. I've had similar problems in the past with the extreme self-awareness OCD stuff, and I also have ADHD - Agmatine eases the obsessive thoughts and lets me live outside of my head a little easier. It's an NMDA antagonist like memantine - I don't know a whole lot about memantine other than that it's an NMDA antagonist and I believe it has a good chance of producing tolerance/withdrawal. I've also heard of people taking megadoses for ketamine-like trips with lasting benefits. Agmatine isn't quite as strong of an NMDA antagonist as memantine (and there are some other differences in its mechanisms of action) but it is very effective and from what I've read it usually doesn't produce tolerance or withdrawal. Long story short, agmatine might end up being a better alternative to memantine, but it depends on the person ofc.
Bromantane's effect on GABA can slow down racing thoughts, and it can help ADHD particularly if yours is related to dopamine. Its effect on dopamine seems to build up over time and has lasting effects. ALCAR can help ADHD too but it's more likely to feel stimulating, in some people it helps anxiety and it worsens it in others. Neither bromantane or ALCAR have a tendency to cause tolerance or withdrawal.",1696395801,k3e25gm,t3_16ym564,t3_16ym564,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

My theory is NMDA make me depressed, pesimistic, neurotic AF. I experienced that on psylocybin trip 5-HT2A agonist (Release sooo much glutamate) I was near suicide.

If you respond well to agmatine give memantine a shot (I don't like Agmatine 5-HT1A agonistic properties) makes me numb after a while due to reduced sensitivity",1703758783,kf90jwj,t3_16ym564,t3_16ym564,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

polgesteirg,"I took alcar today. Didn’t really notice anything but I did hear that it takes time to build up, isn’t as effective oral in low doses and I mixed it with a few other substances. I will keep experimenting until I get either memantine or bromantane. Do you know which one of the former two is closer to nac? Maybe anxiolytic effect like ashwaganda? Ash had terrible side effects for me but it DID basically eliminate anxiety, and nac doesn’t really do anything for my adhd or focus and kinda slows me down but it does do miracles for anxiety and ocd.

CaveLegion,"I think 1500mg is a good ALCAR dose for a lot of people. Memantine is more likely than Bromantane to help with changing thought patterns like NAC. However, you may find more success with Bromantane than Memantine when it comes to slowing down the thoughts and feeling more calm. NAC, Bromantane, and Memantine all affect glutamate but each through different mechanisms. And it's difficult to replicate NAC's mechanisms because they are quite unique, though not necessarily impossible - it seems to work at least in part by modulating AMPA and NMDA receptors. Noopept also modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors, so it might have potential to give you a similar effect on your OCD as NAC does (it also stimulates acetylcholine and dopamine receptors, so could help ADHD). Memantine and Agmatine antagonize NMDA receptors so they can also theoretically be similar or even more effective depending on what exactly is the issue in your brain.

Ashwagandha is quite similar to Bacopa Monnieri in terms of their anxiolytic effects. They are both very effective at reducing cortisol, though Bacopa seems to be better-suited for long-term use and you may find it doesn't produce the same negative side effects as Ashwagandha. Bacopa takes a few days, sometimes a couple weeks to start working.

So there's potential for Bacopa+Noopept or maybe Bacopa+Agmatine to give similar positive effects to those you get from Ashwagandha+NAC, except more sustainable long-term and hopefully with less side-effects. I don't mention Memantine here because from what I've read it just isn't as sustainable long-term as Agmatine, but I could certainly be proven wrong. Still, Memantine can be helpful for short-term relief and could have lasting benefits for OCD by helping you change your thought patterns.",1696589872,k3p7sn6,t3_16ym564,t1_k3np43c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I sometimes redose 9mg of Bromantane if needed in the very beginning of the afternoon
