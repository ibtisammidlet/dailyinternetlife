Friedrich_Ux,Wouldnt use ashwagandha daily as it can cause anhedonia/pssd.,1696354329,k3b6v9p,t3_16ynmux,t3_16ynmux,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Illustrious_Tie_6976,"Some might find choline bitartrate, vitamin b6, ashwaganda, glycine to be both calming and stimulating, especially if taken every day, and this can prevent sleep. 

Choline is a methyl donor (some say bitartrate is useless bc it doesnâ€™t cross the BBB, but they usually donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about and parrot what they see others say).

While glycine is an inhibiting amino, it is also central to NMDA function.",1696364866,k3c13x9,t3_16ynmux,t3_16ynmux,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
roof_lurker,"Yes itâ€™s safe, but note taking Valerian extract daily may be addictive (not in any terrible way, just a bit of anxiety if you donâ€™t have it one night)",1696737778,k3y3332,t3_16ynmux,t3_16ynmux,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Yes itâ€™s safe and those are semi decent doses of gaba and lemon balm (doesnâ€™t say extract second time looking but still)and actually kinda within close range on the rest.
