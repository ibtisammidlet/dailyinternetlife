GlitteringAirport938,"I took it at 1500mg per day to quit Kratom and boost the endorphin release from working out to reignite that habit and it worked really well. I'd say mix it with a b complex, caffeine, and agmatine for a robust dopamine/endorphin release. Timing it before a workout is chef's kiss.",1696698102,k3vhuy9,t3_1727nro,t3_1727nro,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

TigerEye408,"This! Thank you. I never understood it. But I heard it helps with adderall and well I think tapered Suboxone withdrawals. I have taken it before, when I quit meds after a surgery, and it gave me a ton of anxiety. But I went in immediately and did home workouts and you’re absolutely right, timing it before is a chef’s kiss!",1696725258,k3xctzz,t3_1727nro,t1_k3vhuy9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
