StrikingCheesecake69,For me I take a dose 3 days in a row and the effects are really strong about 2-3 days later and last for up to a month.,1696712312,k3withi,t3_172fk2t,t3_172fk2t,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules," I used 3 sprays in the am and usually one or two in the early pm. I skip days but I havnt needed a dose increase ever. Just had to find what worked.

I also have bromantane powder which I’ll snort 25-50 mg splitting and then follow or start. So try a quick spray of vegan MCT oil to help it absorb.

Look into memantine with your bromantane it’s helped me.

EDIT I don’t take the powder and EC spray at the same time. I have done this and it’s a different feeling. Like a less euphoric and less uplifting then phenibut idk it’s different.",1697108051,k4jmz7i,t3_172fk2t,t3_172fk2t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
