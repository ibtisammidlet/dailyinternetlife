Mood is more level feel a calm but stim feel type. My question is there is a lot of discussion on it up regulating the tyrosine but will cause receptor down regulation, wouldn’t it hypothetically bring it back to base line if u suffered stress all your life/lack sleep or just poor nutrition, or other genetic means lacking an enzyme but this kind of steps in for you? Like your running at 78% dopamine normally but then this brings it back to 89-95% baseline. 

TL:DR

*feel better
*Stim feeling but calm 
* music appreciation 
Will this bring my Dopamine levels back to normal levels if I suffered chronic stress or sleep deprivation and that hypothetically wouldn’t down regulate receptors because I’m at my baseline again albeit through artificial means?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/172fk2t/bromantane/

My body cannot handle the noradrenaline. I know its hard to believe but caffeine completely fucked me up.

 I was doing better recently after a round of Rifaximin for SIBO but earlier this week I accidentally ordered a mocha that wasn’t decaf because I forgot to write that. And boom an hour later the little emotional tone I had  gets completely cut off. Days later im still suffering from this crash in my state. Its hell. 

**And what is weird and seems to be a hint is that on Rifaximin I could tolerate caffeine fine like normal.**

There are only 2 exceptions: Armodafinil and Bromantane, TAK-653 if the latter 2 even count.

TAK653 gave me temporary remission from anhedonia twice but not again. Doesn’t do that much now. 

Bromantane has a subtle effect that helps. Armodafinil I can actually tolerate fine, and I feel the dopamine effect which makes things more positive and some slight emotion. 

The commonality between all of these is that  they avoid the NE pathways completely. Stuff like Ritalin or Parnate also blunts me really badly, altho it seems like I recuperated back to baseline from those in a few days while accidental caffeine this time has really done me in 

Dopamine helps as would be expected, but NE fucks me up hard. And this is unfortunate because so many anhedonia meds touch that or serotonin, which btw also blunting for me, even worse bc it fucks up libido too.

GABAergics help my anhedonia, and LDN 0.5 mg has a minor positive effect. 

I am starting to wonder what the issue is. I thought glutamate, but I tolerate Armodafinil 25 mg just fine and it actually helps my symptoms. 

It seems to be noradrenergic stuff specifically. 

In terms of genes, I am SS SLC6A4, COMT val/val, and a cyp2d6 2/4 so poor ish metabolizer. Also homozygous for MTHFR A1298C. Idk if any of these explain it but probably not, as I became sensitive to caffeine suddenly last year. A month after covid and a nasty alcohol hangover. 

It is debilitating to live with this caffeine sensitivity this extreme. What kinds of tests should I do to investigate this? 

I have had high eosinophils 0.7 (0-0.4) and low Abs CD8-CD57 lymphs of 15  (60-360). I wonder if something in my immune system is very off and what I need to investigate or try.
I plan to do the 13 cytokine panel soon. 

Hormonally:

Total Chol 107 (100-199)
Pregnenolone 80 (<150)
Cortisol AM 12.5 (6.2-19.4)
DHEA-S 405 (138-475)
Testosterone 614 (264-916)
E2 27 (7.6-42.6)

Ferritin 60 (30-400)
Vitamin D 61 (30-100)

Also all my symptoms are better at night. 

Im wondering if perhaps my body is not able to mount a cortisol response to caffeine/NE stimulants for some reason.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why do noradrenergic stims immediately worsen my anhedonia?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1727pza/why_do_noradrenergic_stims_immediately_worsen_my/

Hi there,

I suffer from pretty severe anxiety / depression and major cognitive issues (impaired working memory, distractability, brain fog, etc....). I wonder if anyone of you could provide first hand experience reports about DLPA for the aforementioned symptoms.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Experiences with DLPA (DL-Phenylalanine) ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1727nro/experiences_with_dlpa_dlphenylalanine/

It's a very complex topic, but for me specifically:
-Benzodiazepines seem to not induce depression/reduce cognition as opposed to most other gabaergics I tried, but they say Benzoshave bad withdrawal.  
-Im noticed that gabaergics stabalises my moods a lot. They don't make me have a better mood, but I tend to be hyperdopaminergic, I think there should be some kind of biphasic circadian pattern between dopamine and GABA, which I lack.  
-Im notice this disbalance most cause it can result in self destructive hedonistic pleasure pursuits after prolonged stress. Also I feel like normally I can't stop thinking until 'I solved everything'. I think that is related to dopamine. I think GABA would normally induce an alternate state that makes people able to let go, which I can't.

 Eg I think high dopamine low GABA is what sometimes makes me stay up for nights if I can't figure stuff out. In a monophasic pattern",False,t5_4aoxhu,Gabaergics for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/171mwcc/gabaergics_for_me/
