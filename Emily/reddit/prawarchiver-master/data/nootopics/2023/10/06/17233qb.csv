qdouble,The “cure all” ADHD nootropic doesn’t exist that’s why everyone builds nootropic and supplement stacks.,1696680081,k3uc0cs,t3_17233qb,t3_17233qb,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
TreeSlayer-Tak," guanfacine is a off label ADHD treatment and personally has greatly helped my executive function. Also 0.25 (or 1mg) is low for tak, try 2mg (0.5)",1696681224,k3ue0e0,t3_17233qb,t3_17233qb,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
fre-lancer,"For increasing energy to work: I would go with Bromantane, Increasing Testosterone (if your low),  Making sure you have sufficient Iron (important if your deficient), perhaps a DAT inhibitor.  Basically, any substance which increases Striatal Dopamine, which regulates effort to work.

For Behavioral inhibition: Increase Noradrenaline signaling in the PFC. This will allow persistent excitability in the DLPFC, which regulates top-down control of behaviors (Cognitive control), executive function, working memory. You could try: alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (Guanfacine, CBG, clonidine, other), Ritalin, Perhaps Bupropion or any SNRI,  Acetylcholine /m1-AChR agonists/PAMS could assist, lower neuroinflammation--via increasing mGlu3 signaling in the PFC.

Personal Anecdote: Increasing Mitochondrial function helps with my drive, willpower, behavioral control, etc. You could try:  coQ10, PQQ, Methylene Blue (low dose), NAD/Niacin/B2, etc.",1696719192,k3wz5tq,t3_17233qb,t3_17233qb,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Entire_Insurance_532,"Thanks. For the behaviour inhibition, For Behavioral inhibition:   alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (Guanfacine, CBG, clonidine, others) they’re not legal in the UK without prescription required any alternative? Maybe like a supplement that does it?",1696765894,k3z6nii,t3_17233qb,t1_k3wz5tq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,Definitely not. Seems like petty basic ingredients…many of which are underdosed even if they would be useful.,1697583579,k5bs2ba,t3_17233qb,t1_k59ys1r,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

qdouble,"Bromantane, ALCAR, Pramiracetam, CDP-Choline or Alpha GPC (with garlic or PQQ to manage TMAO), B Complex is a good place to start. Adrenal support with organic selenium and iodine can be useful as well. A testosterone stack may also be useful as testosterone can be dopaminergic, improve motivation and energy, etc.",1697587763,k5c2323,t3_17233qb,t1_k5c174w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
