infrareddit-1,Kava produces a calm focus for me. And it upregulates GABA receptors: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00048674.a2010.522554,1696625665,k3rozhu,t3_171mwcc,t3_171mwcc,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,Try Taurine. It increases GABA production and is non-addictive. It is calming. It‚Äôs a antioxidant. Second one I highly recommend for these uses are  Magnesium L-Threonate. Taurine mixed with Magtien has helped me level out and improve my sleep. Another one that has helped the same ways is Agmatine. I have tried a lot of supplements over about 10 years and these work best for me. I am diagnosed ADHD with Panic Disorder with insomnia. I still use a benzo for insomnia but these supplements are helping me heal myself so I can eventually be off pharma meds.,1696700320,k3vnokd,t3_171mwcc,t3_171mwcc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,"You can‚Äôt just assume it‚Äôs related to GABA and dopamine. Sometimes hypomanic episodes happen due to being in a state of hedonism. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs  maybe happening to you. You may also have ADHD which is related to LOW dopamine. It happens to me all the time and stimulants CALM me down making me focus on one thing at a time. Benzos do the same but do it in a different way like the way you‚Äôre describing.

You need a MOOD STABILISER such as lithium Orotate, NAC or Tropisetron to help. Neboglamine may also produce great results for you.

I would avoid Bromantane for now as they make symptoms like youre describing in me experience worse.

If you actually want something non addictive for GABA, use allopregnanolone, Fasoracetam or Baclofen.",1696666970,k3tud0u,t3_171mwcc,t3_171mwcc,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu
