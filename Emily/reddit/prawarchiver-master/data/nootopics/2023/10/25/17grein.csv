NotCommonCommonSense,Only lasts three days if you used kratom more then one day itâ€™s likely rebound effects from that Lol,1698328919,k6jf3h8,t3_17grein,t3_17grein,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
no-google-no-cry,You sure it's not just kratom withdrawal or sickness or psychosomatic symptoms?,1698345736,k6kozff,t3_17grein,t3_17grein,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Melodic-Ad5922,Memantine is such a weak NMDA antagonist that it's unlikely that it'd cause withdrawal. You shouldn't  worry likely kratom more than anything. Sarcosine isnt necessary anyway.,1698437835,k6q9i14,t3_17grein,t3_17grein,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
polgesteirg,"I'd seen ppl say they got permanent changes from memantine, so I wasn't sure. I didn't even abuse kratom that much, 2-3x a week for a month at most. I guess my brain is just THAT sensitive to the combination?",1698371121,k6mhqoy,t3_17grein,t1_k6jf3h8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
polgesteirg,I've experienced those before. This is defo different. I journaled and introspected a lot and can definitely tell a change from my mental state before.,1698371181,k6mhvv7,t3_17grein,t1_k6kozff,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
no-google-no-cry,"Well, you can rest assured that any pharmacological effects are gone.  Many things, including experiences with substances, can change how we think.",1698371609,k6miwum,t3_17grein,t1_k6mhvv7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
