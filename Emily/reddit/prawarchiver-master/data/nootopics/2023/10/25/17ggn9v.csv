antiepoch,Why and how would tyrosine do that?,1698274885,k6gobsn,t3_17ggn9v,t3_17ggn9v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Melodic-Ad5922,"I doubt they share the same transporter. If you did that you'd likely produce a significant amount of oxidative stress. Even if the tyrosine levels are increased in the brain they are still reliant on enzymatic conversion into L-DOPA. More than likely tyrosine does nothing as the only evidence of effect is very weak RCTs and rat studies. You eat tyrosine everyday likely over 4 grams taking 500mg is likely to do very little if anything. Also, instead of doing mental gymnastics to increase dopamine, if you truly wanted to do it, exercise would do it. Exercise increases pBDNF which crosses the BBB there by increasing dopamine through increased glutamate release. Or just take a stimulant... Also, that's a very dangerous game you're playing if it were to actually work. Seratonin is a major neuromodulator, it's not all about dopamine and dopamine. Hell some Seratonin receptors increase dopamine release lol. Seratonin is involved in the regulation of the total concentrations of specific neurotransmitters in specific brain regions i.e. 5-HT2c in the PFC. Also, through depletion of 5-HT in the brain you'd have less activation of the 5-HT2a (which doesn't upregulate upon antagonism) which would reduce glutamate signaling and BDNF signaling. However, I'm not very knowledgeable in this topic and it doesn't sound like your are either so I'd suggest not experimenting in your body, you only have one.",1698438303,k6qar0k,t3_17ggn9v,t3_17ggn9v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Melodic-Ad5922,"Oh, I get what you're saying, to my understanding there are concentration gradient transporters that grab AA in higher concentrations. However, there's ATP dependent transporters which grab specific amino acids so as to prevent an imbalance. However, I wouldn't recommend either of those supplements. Excess dietary tyrosine produces hypercholesterolemia and oxidative stress. BCAAs can cause other issues as well like elevated IGF-1. As long as you eat enough protein in a day none of this should matter.",1698501479,k6tjj6s,t3_17ggn9v,t1_k6sp0zw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
