The SARMS community couldn’t help with this question so much lol.

I took it for a few days but scared but I was also stacking LGD4003 with it. It was odd as I have never been into PEDS at all. But I felt pretty good on the MK.

Anyway anything would be cool and helpful. I don’t think stacking all of those would be wise either just saying what I am currently taking.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"I have 15mg MK-677 pills, wondering if anyone has experience with the compound.

Tropisetrons bioavailability is mainly determined by the activity of these enzymes. Therefore, taking Tropisetron with certain cannabinoids like CBD enhanced bioavailability and duration(halflife).

_*Disclaimer: Overlap in metabolism is a very significant medical indication, you need to be careful with this and titrate up very slowly in dosage as long as there is not much known about this specific interaction yet_

Besides synergy in metabolism, tropisetron and CBD have some overlap in what people use them for, while having notably different mechanisms.

Some examples both substances get used for:  
-Against anxiety
-Against inflanmation
-To induce relaxation

 Thus, for these purposes combining Tropisetron and CBD might provide a more broader range of effects, which is often desirable for several reasons.

One reason might be because an individual knows the problem but not the specific causes. Because CBD is relatively cheap and potentiates Tropisetron, it doesn’t come with much financial burden, might even be cheaper.

There are other cannabinoids besides CBD that might also be promosing or even more desirable. I take CBDa which is way more potent with similar effects as CBD, costing significantly less per dose. Also I don't take pure CBDa but CBDa full spectrum paste. This means it has some other cannabinoid contents in small traces, which contribute to an entourage effect(synergy/potentiation between cannabinoids)",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tropisetron+ CBD Synergism,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/174gih5/tropisetron_cbd_synergism/
