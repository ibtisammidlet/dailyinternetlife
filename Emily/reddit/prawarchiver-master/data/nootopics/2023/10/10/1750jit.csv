Fancy-Category,"MK plus LGD means a ton of water weight, bloat, and potentially high blood pressure. MK is a dirty GH secretagogue compared to the others. You get prolonged prolactin and cortisol release; so it is best to take upon waking. You should take something like berberine with MK because MK reduces insulin sensitivity.",1696984806,k4cqnou,t3_1750jit,t3_1750jit,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
ButtifulPower,"Mk677 can increase anxiety in some people. Ghrelin mimetic act on the same pathway as fear in your brain. With that said it’s cheap to use for a gh boost but be careful of high blood sugar. I used it several time and I end up putting too much fat. Nowadays I use it sparingly,like twice a week, on my hardest workout to recover a bit faster.",1696996938,k4dhjd1,t3_1750jit,t3_1750jit,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Juggy38,"Mk677 is sloppy. Massive hunger increases, lethargy, lots of water retention, and wrecks insulin sensitivity compared to the equivalent amount of GH response from rHGH or the cleaner peptides. I’d only use it if 1 you are an extremely lean hardgainer that cannot eat enough calories. Ipamorelin +CJC 2-3x a day or just use real rHGH.",1697038416,k4fgwov,t3_1750jit,t3_1750jit,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

MezDez,Prolactin and cortisol increases on mk677? Every study says otherwise. Is there something I don't know?,1697013200,k4e4ojd,t3_1750jit,t1_k4cqnou,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Yeah no I’m not taking the LGD was just reexamining the mk677. How long would a nootropic cycle look like compared to a ped cycle,1696987861,k4cy0ey,t3_1750jit,t1_k4cqnou,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,Well this explains quite a bit. I took it for three days with the sarm and was having ungodly panic attacks but also really calm at night. I figured I had tanked my test as I had just got off suboxone on to sublacade which already does that. But none the less I think I’ll skip it and just toss the pills. For ever one positive report I read I find about 100 negative ones.,1697019294,k4ecdgj,t3_1750jit,t1_k4dhjd1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,I have strong tongkat extract. I’m worried about the side effects of the mk. I tried it for a few days last year and I remember I had some bad anxiety but I was also taking lgd so. Idk maybe I’ll try it PED are very interesting to me I also haves cardarine. That one scares me though hahaha.,1697842039,k5r79re,t3_1750jit,t1_k5obxpp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fancy-Category,MK not good for nootropics purposes. Ipamorelin would be more up your alley if you want to use GH to improve your mind.,1697045839,k4g1l0l,t3_1750jit,t1_k4cy0ey,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fancy-Category,"None. It can make you feel tired, reduce libido, and reduce testosterone. It’s a not good side effect of MK.",1697045801,k4g1h6c,t3_1750jit,t1_k4g1csl,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
