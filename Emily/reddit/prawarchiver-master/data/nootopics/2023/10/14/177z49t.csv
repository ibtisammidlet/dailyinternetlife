ketofolic,"By the time you consume the cod liver oil it is highly oxidized, basically PUFAs turn into a mix of 4HNE, Acrolein and other highly reactive aldehydes that even serve as biomarkers for disease. They suppress immune function and therefor people wtith primary autoimmunity issues might feel initial relief, but youre going down a very dirty road to mitochondrial dysfunction, wrong hormone signaling, insulin resistance, oxLDL etc... Same accounts for other products with high PUFA, especially Omega-6, content, like seed oils. Avoid at all costs.",1697395270,k50e31x,t3_177z49t,t3_177z49t,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

apextruthspeaker,"Source for your absurd claims regarding ""mitochondrial dysfunction, wrong hormone signaling, insulin resistance, oxLDL, etc"" or are you just talking out of your ass? Many supplement companies have stringent regulations for oxidation, and the effects of the low amounts presented are negligible or outweighed by the benefits of omega-3s. There is an indisputable mountain of evidence supporting the supplementation of omega 3s for health and cognition so I don't understand your stance on the matter.

,"6. Failed approaches to improving dopamine  
Dopamine precursors: L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine are used as supplements, and L-Dopa is found in both supplements and prescription medicine.  
  
Both L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine can be found in diet, and endogenously they experience a rate-limited conversion to L-Dopa by tyrosine hydroxylase. L-Dopa freely converts to dopamine but L-Tyrosine does not freely convert to L-Dopa.  
  
As elaborated further in prior posts, supplementation with L-Tyrosine or L-Phenylalanine is only effective in a deficiency, and the likelihood of having one is slim. Excess of these amino acids can not only decrease dopamine, but produce oxidative stress.\[14\] This makes their classification as nootropics unlikely. Their benefits to stimulant comedown may be explained by stimulants suppressing appetite.  
  
L-Dopa (Mucuna Pruriens in supplement form), come with many side effects,\[15\] so much so that it was unusable in older adults for the purpose of promoting cognition. In fact, it impaired learning and memory and mainly caused side effects.\[16\] XD",1697414869,k51ssae,t3_177z49t,t1_k51r2ej,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
