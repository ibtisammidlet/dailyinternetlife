PowerHungryGandhi,"Most do not have this experience and the two are used together clinically for adhd. 

They do however kinda reduce the side effects for me 

Of course your experience is valid",1697658293,k5g3ugw,t3_17ay5qd,t3_17ay5qd,11,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"My gf has had amazing success with 5mg early am then concerta around 9 and a booster round 2 seems to keep her low tolerance going. Sorry it didn’t work

I personally have used  dxm in low doses like one or two robotussin soft gels and I found it taken a little before my adderall it would work way hetter",1697666298,k5gpsn3,t3_17ay5qd,t3_17ay5qd,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

ConsequenceLatter978,"It’s better for resetting tolerance.. also look into TAK-653 … memantine even at low dose interferes with my ADHD medication… creatine, magnesium threonate, Uridine, and Omega 3s will all enhance amphetimine and caffeine usage",1697729185,k5k1z8a,t3_17ay5qd,t3_17ay5qd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Righteous_Fury,"During my memantine trials, I found that I had to be doing regular cardio workouts to have the most benefit.  The exercise boosts the effectiveness of Adderall, and with the memantine slowing tolerance buildup, I felt amazing.

I would always take at least one, usually 2 days per week off the Adderall. 

With memantine, I could get 5 days of great Adderall per week consistently.  The one day of the meds per week+ cardio workouts was the key to success",1697817352,k5pe49d,t3_17ay5qd,t3_17ay5qd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

**Timing of Administration to Address Tolerance:**
- **During a Tolerance Break:** Potentially aids in resetting or reducing tolerance by modulating the glutamatergic system.
- **Prior to Taking the Drug or Stimulant:** Might mitigate the development of tolerance by inhibiting NMDA receptor-mediated pathways.
- **During Use:** Co-administration could minimize tolerance development but might have unpredictable effects on the drug or stimulant's effects.
- **After Use:** Might help modulate neuroplastic changes associated with tolerance development, though possibly less effective compared to pre- or co-administration",1698403326,k6nx24u,t3_17ay5qd,t3_17ay5qd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bierak,"I never developed a tolerance to methylphenidate while using 2 - 3 mg of memantine. However, I did notice a reduction in the effects of any nootropic that worked under the glutamatergic channel: idra-21, piracetam, sunifiram.

Bierak,So perhaps we could use NMDA antagonists before stims for preveting tolerance: Huperzine and Mag Threonate comes to my mind.,1698043315,k62oe05,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k5gpsn3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Potential_Low4134,Ahh ok I think my high dosing has been blunting my meds. I’m going to take a few days off to let the memantine level in my body drop down. Thanks for your experience,1697666389,k5gq143,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k5gpsn3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Potential_Low4134,I am thinking due to its long half life and me dosing daily from 10-30mg memantine for a few weeks that maybe I have built up quite a high level of it in my body. Probably at this dose it’s enough to negate any stimulant action,1697658582,k5g4nqr,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k5g48rb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

dearmisterrobot,"30mg is definitely a high dose, 10mg should be pretty enough for tolerance reset benefits.

So I would give couple of days off memantine and then get back to 10mg a day while checking how stimulants are felt.

Potential_Low4134,Yeh gonna leave the memantine for a few days then try a much lower dose or possibly dosing every other day. Hopefully this will have better effects for me. Thanks for the advice,1697666504,k5gqbod,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k5g5717,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Potential_Low4134,Yeh I think the long half life means I should have been dosing less. Just need to wait for the whole lot to clear my system now and then hopefully my adhd meds will work again,1697658771,k5g5727,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k5g50id,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Wise-_-Spirit,"tldr: Usually 2 days on 2 days off. I didn't really have a schedule though. Just kinda pop a 30mg robotab or  2x15mg softgel at morning and again begore dinner

Sometimes I also take much larger dose on the weekend and then take many days off until it's properly metabolized and excreted, tolerance back to baseline

For that use a ""plateau calculator"" aim for mid second to lower third plateau for your bodyweight 

If you use freebase robotabs make sure to remember 30mg freebase = 40mg HBr, as most calculators are calibrate to HBr 

Those doses can be recreational, effects are pretty unique but most similar to ketamine with a mushroomy/cannabislike headspace. Haha that's a laughable comparison but still the closest.

There is still medicinal benefit at these doses just stay hydrated and don't mix with any SSRI or MAOI drugs. It's beneficial for the same reasons ketamine infusions produce lasting change, plus it agonizes sigma-1 receptors which is implicated in the benefit of DMT 

You know you reached overuse when you start getting high glutamate rebound effects between doses or after stopping:
anxiety, racing thoughts, ruminating, insomnia, trouble focusing, and agitation/overstimulation",1698063196,k63ff6v,t3_17ay5qd,t1_k62obav,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
