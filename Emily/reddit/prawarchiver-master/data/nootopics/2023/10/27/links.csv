I play a lot of games often with repetitive motions and while I was  using piracetam almost daily I developed what I think was very mild  carpal tunnel. It was hard to sleep or do many things and I had to learn  to do stretches, wear a wrist brace, and generally be careful. After I  stopped using piracetam this got a lot better. I suspect it was a  combination of piracetam enabling me to strain myself much more and also  an increased awareness of my bodily sensations, including how my nerves  felt.

Through was mechanism could  this have happened? how can I continue using piracetam while managing  the increased awareness of the symptoms? I've already put plenty of work  into improving posture, ergonomics, doing stretches, etc. so I don't  need that. More like perhaps something to take with piracetam to combat  this.
