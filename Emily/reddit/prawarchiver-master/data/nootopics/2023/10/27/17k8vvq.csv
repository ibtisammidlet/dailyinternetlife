BDNFan,"A similar strange thing happened to me. After I began to take piracetam daily I noticed I was having exceedingly homoerotic thoughts. Almost everything I did reminded me of penis.

This piracetam-induced gayness went away right after I stopped taking it and it hasn't come back since. Do you think that the carpal-tunnel could be related to this?

It makes me wonder what mechanism is causing is responsible. Do HACU enhancers induce conditioned penis preference? or was this effect meditated via AMPA? Anyways it makes me fearful to try TAK if it truly is so much stronger, selective, and manlier than piracetam",1698715494,k766zvi,t3_17k8vvq,t3_17k8vvq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CaveLegion,"Something to relax your muscles could help with straining, I'd suggest trying a chelated magnesium if you haven't already. Piracetam increases activity in the central nervous system: stimulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors releases more dopamine, which makes your muscles tighter. Gabaergics can help your muscles relax without negating the stimulatory benefits, magnesium is effective at this especially if you're at all deficient",1699262418,k81rggy,t3_17k8vvq,t3_17k8vvq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

polgesteirg,I was aware magnesium relaxed you CNS but wasn’t aware that it mediated gaba in any way. How exactly? My experiences with msg glycinate and threonate haven’t been the best. Made me restless and kind of anxious. The opposite of a gabaergic.,1699296771,k83si96,t3_17k8vvq,t1_k81rggy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
