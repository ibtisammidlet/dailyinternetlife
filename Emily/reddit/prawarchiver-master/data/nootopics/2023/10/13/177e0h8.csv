Narrow_Fig_778,I would phrase the question in a manner that highlights the effects your looking for. Rhodiola Rosea with high salidroside and no rosavins is a mood booster (maoi) and stimulant.,1697292202,k4ueqfm,t3_177e0h8,t3_177e0h8,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"I've been using many nootropics for years and it's surprisingly difficult to find a light stimulant which is not based on caffeine...and I've searched a lot. (maca, yeba mate, green tea all contain caffeine)

There are some compounds which help a bit against fatigue, but they are not stimulants. They will help fight fatigue but won't chase sleepiness away (for me at least)

Ginseng, Rhodiola (an extract with 3% of Salidroside) and Eleuthero are  good to help you during long days of work.  I feel absolutely no ""wake-up effect"" from them.
But with it, I can remain productive longer when I'm tired.

I tried Theacrine...it's ""meh""...very slight stimulation, long lasting, but very very mild. When you're really tired, it won't do anything.

To be honest, apart from caffeine, I only know Modafinil (needs a prescription!) and Phenylpiracetam (no more than once or twice a week because of tolerance) that are real alternatives to caffeine...",1697278807,k4tquce,t3_177e0h8,t3_177e0h8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

lord_weasel,"I’ve been using nootropics for many years, dabbled in many areas, lots of rc’s, and have only kept the useful ones around. After everything I’ve tried, interestingly enough, more recently NAC is what has really stood out to me. For being an amino acid, it’s quite powerful. It’s not a stimulant by any means, but it improves motivation without screwing with your neurochemistry and is also a great antioxidant. It reduces the psychological need for stimulating things like caffeine and other stims. I have had manic times before and definitely seek a balance, and I’ve found that NAC really levels it all out, it gives motivation to get shit done without hyper focusing. It’s cheap too and can be bought on Amazon. It’s a great tool to have with you.",1697268705,k4tdq49,t3_177e0h8,t3_177e0h8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

polgesteirg,"well basically similar effects to coffee: removal of sleepiness, focus, and motivation increase. The most important one for me is not feeling tired. I also recently learned caffeine isn't the strongest when it comes to raising motivation (dopamine reuptake) so that's another reason I want to switch. 

I've heard of rhodiola and was considering. I've had bad experiences with Ashwaganda, so hopefully it's not too similar of an adaptogen. Does it meet the criteria in your experience? ,",1697293188,k4ugy8t,t3_177e0h8,t1_k4ueqfm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
