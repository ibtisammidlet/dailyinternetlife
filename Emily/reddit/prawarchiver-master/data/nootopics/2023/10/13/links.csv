I've been chronically stressed for years. I've been living in a situation where I've felt so helpless and alone. I've had very elevated cortisol levels (proven by Dutch test). Basically been living in extreme anxiety and fear for awhile. I've realized though that no one is coming to save me and I'm taking the the steps necessary to improve, change, and take control. Currently looking for literally anything that helps nootropics wise. I don't feel nearly as smart or strong cognition wise as I used to. 

* Anything to help regrow the braincells that have been lost living in this state? Or that would help to put my mind or nervous system back to how it should be? 
* Also anything that helps with sleep and circadian rhythm? I live in a cloudy Northern climate so only so much I can do (i use a happy light in the morning and avoid blue light at night). 

Currently trying Bromantane and it does help with focus and some anxiety. '

Again, I'm doing all the lifestyle things I believe should be done but I'm still open to suggestions. 

Thanks

Centera Bioscience (ND company) got 1 count and the general manager 2 counts due to something.

I tried to access the court documents via PACER (a federal system that should allow to access court documents of US cases) but I can't get through their paywall for some reason, which could be due to the fact my billing card isn't attached to the US address. The cost should be only $0.1/page or $3 per document, so a total of \~3-9$ to get this information. Can anybody register an account on PACER, enter New Hampshire's court-specific PACER page, and search by the case number *1:23-cr-00069*?

Obviously, posting this to /r/nootropics subreddit, got my post immediately removed... I suppose other people also tried to find out earlier but could not due to the censorship. The subreddit is heavily moderated by ND itself with full-time paid moderators to make sure the public perception about nootropics is as malformed towards the benefit of ND as possible, so as far as I know, even talking about the research of novel nootropics is prohibited as well. I've seen people getting banned if they post about anything that could divert attention from ND's ""safe and ineffective"" herbal powders for 3-6x the cost of what you can get from EU companies with equivalent or better testing. Shame how disspirited and complacent people can become, making millions of dollars and not even once producing anything new that isn't already mass-produced by big Chinese manufacturers (that every single supplement company in the world resells from) years ago, only investing in ways to bait people with ""trendy"" marketing images and 0 creative potential of pioneer spirit that was essential to bring awareness of such a concept as ""nootropic"" into the minds of people.",False,t5_4aoxhu,For what reason is Nootropics Depot charged by the US Department of Justice with 2 criminal counts for MisterYouAreSoDumb (Nootropics Depot owner)? | /r/nootropics trying to censor this post,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1778ek8/for_what_reason_is_nootropics_depot_charged_by/
