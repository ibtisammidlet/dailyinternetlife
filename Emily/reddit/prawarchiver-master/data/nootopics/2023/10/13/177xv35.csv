sirsadalot,"Hopefully one day we can push for a legal avenue for people who want to sell nootropics over the counter. There's really no valid reason to ban Piracetam, just an authoritative push for maintaining the current pharmaceutical system. Pharmaceutical companies could make money selling these things over the counter. As long as it fits Corneliu's guidelines for safety I don't see a moral problem with it. Obviously the FDA would like their power moves to be seen as them being ethical but that's not really the case.

As for Phenibut and Tianeptine, I'm not as quick to defend them. But it's unfair to put everything on a level playing field.",1697323045,k4wjbtl,t3_177xv35,t3_177xv35,14,False,t5_4aoxhu

HankHill2160,"It's just amusing to me how people are getting in trouble for selling piracetam. It just makes me think of the places where it's legal to buy cocaine and meth, like what?? (Not that I personally agree with it or not)

I wish there was a way to kick the FDA's ass and have them fuck off. I always fear that they're going to start messing with sirsadalot.

Is there ever anything we can do to mitigate further growth of the FDA's control and power?",1697393887,k50aaqx,t3_177xv35,t3_177xv35,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

This men has an obsessive and personal affair against nootropics. He was responsible for placing piracetam in the category of toxic and dangerous drug by the FDA.

0vermind74,"I'm getting really heated and upset about this. It has nothing to do with /u/misteryouaresodumb specifically, but the fact that according to the first document, it states that,

‚Äúthese drugs are **prescription drugs** due to their toxicity and potential for harmful effect‚Äù and ‚ÄúCentral Bioscience and Eftang sold these **prescription drugs** without a prescription from a practitioner license to administer such drugs.‚Äù 

Wtf? Specifically, they are staying that anything can be classified as a prescription drug if it has the potential for toxicity or harmful affect. Is this really a law? That could be just about any nootropic. Yes, more government control and charging vendors with misdemeanors is definitely the answer.",1699754273,k8vh8np,t3_177xv35,t3_177xv35,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

BroScienceAlchemist,"The FDA explicitly began going after racetams a few years ago. The most I can speculate is that piracetam is being studied as a possible medical treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and could be profitable if it becomes an FDA approved treatment. There are not many approved treatments for Alzheimers. I didn't look too closely into it, but the quality of studies has been poor. The clampdown has been indirect by pressuring payment processors, who push vendors into smaller markets. Ceretropic had to shut down because they could not get payment processors to work with them, and the market of consumers that will use crypto is too small to sustain the scale they had grown into.

Phenibut was always just a matter of time as GABAnergic drugs get heavy scrutiny, and its addictive properties make it very undesirable as a nootropic. The long half-life also makes it much more addiction-prone than GHB, which requires active redosing 24/7. However, the compulsion to keep redosing GHB is much stronger due to its much stronger effects.

Nootropics Depot's plea agreement is one year of probation with no fines, as they are more interested in signaling to other vendors that they will take legal action.",1697318332,k4w81ng,t3_177xv35,t1_k4w27gk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Ok that's fine, I can understand scheduling and the regulation of analogs, but none of the stuff they are attacking are scheduled. It's like one branch of the FDA knows that they can't get things scheduled that they would like to, so they set their sights on other ways to pass penalties or punishments. Specifically the document said that these are ‚Äúprescription drugs due to their toxicity and potential for harmful effect‚Äù and that he sold them without a prescription or prescribers license.",1699754553,k8vhuqw,t3_177xv35,t1_k4w27gk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
