suckonmymemestits,"Preface - I'm always the one in that company's subreddit trying to put into perspective how cringy/culty everyone appears. I feel half that subreddit would do misteryouaresodumb's laundry, just to show their ""gratitude"" for the quality control that nd promotes. It's sickening, they're a business, show your gratitude by opening your wallet. Quit trying to suck the dude's ****

Concession/rebuttal - that being said, nootropics depot does appear to have better than average quality control, and the staff does appear to genuinely have passion about their products (as vanilla as most of those products are). Additionally, some of their products are entirely unique. Some of their products are one of a kind extracts that you can't get anywhere else (credit where credit is due)

Reality - I literally take nothing from that company, not because I don't feel their quality control is up to par, but because I have no need for any of the (generally vanilla) products they offer, and they're not the only shop in town offering good-enough-quality-control on the stuff generic enough for them to sell. 

Meta - I've been banned from this subreddit for talking down about the owner of bromantane.co , who started this sub and had also stacked the mod team heavily in his favor. So, it appears there is nowhere completely unbiased to discuss nootropics directly on reddit. I would take that into consideration as well.

All that to say, nothing is coming up when I search that case number on Pacer. I need more information",1697233102,k4rhzvv,t3_1778ek8,t3_1778ek8,35,False,t5_4aoxhu
0phenyl,">The subreddit is heavily moderated by ND itself with full-time paid moderators to make sure the public perception about nootropics is as **malformed towards the benefit of ND** as possible, so as far as I know, even talking about the research of novel nootropics is prohibited as well.

Too true. It's a shame. r/Nootropics should be about nootropics, 'nuff said.",1697234356,k4rl3mw,t3_1778ek8,t3_1778ek8,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"Basically all of this has to with one men behind the attack against supplements and nootropics: Pieter D Cohen:

This men has an obsessive and personal affair against nootropics. He was responsible for placing piracetam in the category of toxic and dangerous drug by the FDA.

I tried posting about this on r/Phenibut and was told by the mod who mods both r/Phenibut and r/nootropics that they were not removing posts about this, and they actually then removed my post from r/Phenibut for not being specific enough. Which makes sense if what they said was true. Maybe Majalisk has no idea that they are removing posts. I don’t know how modding works or if you can remove posts without other mods knowing

Regardless this is awful, I’m not an ND fan boy but I feel bad for them for getting the DOJ on their ass. They weren’t marketing the stuff on their site as a supplement.",1697307289,k4vgbvk,t3_1778ek8,t3_1778ek8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

0vermind74,"Any update as to if anyone has posted a question about all of this to the Nootropics community? I'm a person that is against more regulation and a supporter of free enterprise - businesses not controlled by the government when they are doing things right. 

I understand this appears to be a subreddit for people who don't like Nootropics. I'm pretty neutral I guess, except for the fast that I despise and do not support the “more regulation” movement. I think if someone wants to build a business working with Nootropics and chemicals that are not regulated or scheduled, and they are as careful as misteryouaresodumb is, which he is. The FDA should be attacking shady companies and vendors that do not third party test the stuff they sell, etc. Theyre attacking someone that has, as far as I have knowledge of, been very careful about ensuring the purity and safety of the things he sells. He seems to be pretty level headed about the decisions he makes? Unless I am missing something. This comment might end up getting downvoted. Specifically my anger is on the additional control that is being enforced. The charging documents specifically state that these things he was selling are considered prescription drugs, and that he is selling them without a prescription or valid prescribers license.",1699755736,k8vkgo0,t3_1778ek8,t1_k4vgbvk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
