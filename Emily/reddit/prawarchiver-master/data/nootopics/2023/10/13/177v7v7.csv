,"Oh man I have so much to say about this just making the post is slightly overwhelming.

Basically from trauma and chronic stress your hormone/neurotransmitter feedback loops / axis's are all fucked up and dysregulated. The suggestion for ashawaganda before bed is a really good one as that helps to put things back on track. In a really similar situation to you ashawaganda + **pregnenolone** did wonders for me, but why matters, and here's why. 

Don't worry about 'regrowing braincells' lost from living like this, the braincells are there and they're fine. They're more or less 'sleeping.' Chronic stress, trauma, and sluggish/weak cognition == dissociation which is just another presentation of brain fog or brain inflammation, but unlike say brain fog caused by long covid you can't permanently solve the issue with just nootropics and such. The dissociation/weak cognition is 50% your wires being crossed from the stress and 50% **your own brain numbing you in an attempt to make you feel safer or prevent further pain / trauma**. Understanding that part is key if you want to alleviate things chemically (and behaviorally really).

I strongly recommend reading about 'neurodivergent burnout' as I think it will help you understand part of what you're experiencing cognitively; now onto advice. If you haven't before the concept of 'nervous system regulation' is good to brush up on, you said you had it covered behaviorally but the stuff I recommend chemically is aligned along that framework. 

**The things you need to optimize for are sensitization, safety/anxiety, and inflammation**.

Only add in strong neurogenesis/plasticity promoters when you're on that track and in an environment that supports it.

The other thing is **treat the trauma and chronic stress and I damn near swear your cognition will come back 100% with a little time and patience.** (And kindness to yourself).

**Recommended drug starter pack:**

\- Ashawaganda (sensoril preferably)

\- Pregnenolone (low dose to start, pref with the asha)

\- Agmatine 

\- Theanine

\- High quality magnesium glycinate or preferably threonate

\- Lithium oroate (low dose, 5mg or less)

\- **LOW DOSE NALTREXONE** **<-** wonder drug for chronic stress/trauma + brain fog. 

\- 5-HTP (not at the same time as the lithium) would probably be a good call as well. 

Of course don't start all these things at once, but they play super well together (same with the bromantane!) so you can add on pretty quickly.",1697332681,k4x5cs0,t3_177v7v7,t3_177v7v7,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

Electrical_March845,"Look into allopregnanolone! It's an endogenous neurosteroid that is FDA approved to treat post partum depression. Social isolation lowers allopregnanolone production, and in fact it's currently being used off label to cure the cognitive side effects that come with loneliness. It's pretty hard to source though, also expensive and has to be injected (although you may be able to make a nasal spray).

An alternative would be pregnenolone, which you can buy as a supplement. It's oral and undergoes metabolism in several ways, one of them leading to progesterone, which further metabolizes into allopregnanolone. You can firmly increase allopregnanolone taking pregnenolone, but you'd also be increasing the levels of other hormones.

Take a look at the explanation of pregnenolone metabolism here: [https://nootropicsdepot.com/pregnenolone-quick-dissolve-tablets/](https://nootropicsdepot.com/pregnenolone-quick-dissolve-tablets/) keep in mind that 5mg is a very small dose designed to be taken without needing to do a blood test first.

The higher the dose, the more allopregnanolone (and other hormones) you will get from the pregnenolone metabolism. A clinical dose is like 200 mg, and I've seen supplements with up to 100mg per capsule. But you'd need to do blood tests to be safe with that kind of dosage.

To improve the circadian rhythm look into melatonin and nobiletin. For neurogenesis and neuroplasticity look into mushroom and plant extracts, like tiger lion extract, erinamax (lion's mane extract), bacopa...

Also high quality fish oil, magnesium, and vitamin D3 + K2. Among many other things, magnesium helps with sleep, vitamin D helps to establish a circadian rhythm (take it at morning), and fish oil helps with chronic inflammation and lowers cortisol.",1697334717,k4x9pig,t3_177v7v7,t3_177v7v7,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
