Mediocre_Art3895,"Mk trashed my insulin sensitivity and made me very lethargic but I did get the benefits like better sleep, recovery, skin improvements. (No test base, Sarm goblin)

Planning on going back on it alongside with GDA supplements to combat the blood glucose changes. (W/test base)",1697752436,k5ltvv3,t3_17brht1,t3_17brht1,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
LetsGetGon,That's how often I use I get crazy water retention even at 4 days. Need lots of taurine and low salt to get rid of it. I think even twice a week can be enough.,1697744701,k5l8yjg,t3_17brht1,t3_17brht1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Curious_Estate_5550,No needs for a T base IMO. Also gotta say tha Dihydroberberine or berberine HCL was great helping my insuline sensitivity,1697758137,k5m7s67,t3_17brht1,t1_k5ltvv3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Flyboys_89,My water retention wasnt that bad but the scale shot up 4 pounds in like 2 weeks so definately was a factor. Taurine is in my daily stack so that would be covered. Might take it on like mondays and wednesdays or something?,1697744819,k5l9ag9,t3_17brht1,t1_k5l8yjg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Flyboys_89,I have berberine on hand. When would u take the MK and when would u take the Berberine? Read many different answers as to when people take the two.,1697760472,k5mdd0p,t3_17brht1,t1_k5m7s67,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

LetsGetGon,Sure I prefer slightly higher less often. I had to take 5g+ of taurine. Had to fast to get rid of the bloating.,1697746074,k5lcqmx,t3_17brht1,t1_k5l9ag9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Curious_Estate_5550,"Mk at night so you get good sleep and no ""hungryness"" (sleeps throw It) and Berberine 500mg 30 mins before every meal. That's what I did.",1697761996,k5mh03z,t3_17brht1,t1_k5mdd0p,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
impeterlewis,"“(No Test base, Sarma Goblin)” made it sound as if MK needed anything that a sarms would",1699172216,k7wht2g,t3_17brht1,t1_k7vwwzj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mediocre_Art3895,"My comment still does not state anywhere that mk677 is androgenic.

Also, majority knows mk677 would be much better paired with any anabolic steroid agent due to the synergistic effect of elevated IGF-1 levels + exogenous androgens (better building muscle potential) rather than just taking mk677 alone.",1699265069,k81uljk,t3_17brht1,t1_k7wht2g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
