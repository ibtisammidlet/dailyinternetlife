Legitimate_Banana512,"Maybe try out Kava kava/ kavalactones!

They antagonises glycine receptors and are great for OCD and GAD. I'm having about the same issues as you and it seems to work, although I prefer to take half a capsule otherwise it's too sedative for me (but some extracts are more/less sedative than others)

Oh and also adhd yes",1697965499,k5y144n,t3_17d0css,t3_17d0css,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

mikorbu,"The ammonia portion definitely plays a part, but with the ADHD/GAD/OCD you mention Iâ€™d wager itâ€™s a part of a larger issue with disordered NMDA/glutamate signaling.

Have you tried NAC/NACET by chance? It restores normal function of glutamate antiporters and is commonly used for GAD/OCD and ADHD-PI.

You should also try some L-Ornithine and Zinc Chelate at night to aid in removing ammonia from the brain, and something like Jigsaw B-Free Magnesium since that also plays a part and is intimately tied with all of the mentioned conditions (plus itâ€™s chelated to malate, which helps with the astrocyte over-activation from glutamate issues).",1697910459,k5uxmrm,t3_17d0css,t3_17d0css,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Switch_23,"Glycine serves as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, primarily within the spinal cord and brainstem. It binds to glycine receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride ion channels. Experiencing sedation from glycine is not uncommon, I experience the same effects as you did, however they last up to 8h and definitely not two days. Take it before bed, you'll probably sleep better and try a lower dose.",1697926703,k5w351q,t3_17d0css,t3_17d0css,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MaybeJohnD,"Could be ammonia conversion in the gut by bacteria, to me that seems more likely than it having anything to do with the intended NMDA coagonism. 1g is a pretty low dose anyways, as far as neurotransmission is concerned. Not relevant for D serine if the ammonia thing is the case.

Personally I also get a (suspected) ammonia reaction from glycine but still intend to try other NMDA things like d serine and sarcosine.

This is not medical advice etc.",1697898828,k5u3i3d,t3_17d0css,t3_17d0css,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Switch_23,"Ammonia? Id prescribe this to glycine's inhibitory action in the CNS in the spinal cord, where it acts as a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It's a co-agonist in the cortex, but an inhibitory transmitter in the spinal cord. OP's response, the sedation, is  not uncommon, in fact, I experience the same effect. However definitely not as overblown as he described it. The sedation lasts around 6 to 8 hours with the first 4 hours being the strongest.",1697926383,k5w2eda,t3_17d0css,t1_k5u3i3d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

MaybeJohnD,"Yes, its the gut bacteria that could be responsible here so anything off with them might be related, and having a bad reaction to glutamine points in the same direction imo. 

Not to freak you out but significant ammonia elevations can be dangerous so I'd be careful and I'd try to get it in front of a doctor if it were me. If they see high ammonia they would probably take it seriously and could have genuine interventions that may help you, so it's worth a shot.",1698001666,k604hka,t3_17d0css,t1_k5u3x4o,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MaybeJohnD,"I'm aware of the action there, it's just the degree to which OP has it at the dose does seem kind of unusual, so it could be more than one thing going on.

Also there are connections between glutamine (which OP mentioned flares up their issues) and ammonia, which I'm not going to try to explain perfectly but can be read about. 

The basic inhibitory action generally does make more sense to jump to first, but I think everyone should be aware of ammonia increases and the associated risks. Not that glycine will or is even likely to precipitate those, but severe intolerance to generally fairly benign amino acids like glutamine and glycine is worrying.

Again, not medical advice but personally I would tell my doctor about it.",1698001272,k603eg3,t3_17d0css,t1_k5w2eda,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
