My bad glycine experience happened last year, I took it monday morning to help with anxiety, by lunchtime I was so wiped out I had go to bed and stayed there until Wednesday afternoon. As well sleepy also made me feel depressed 

I have ADHD, OCD GAD, and Glutamine makes these symptoms much worse

Any thoughts on the mechanisms behind this and do you think d-serine would have same reaction?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Would a bad reaction to Glycine mean that D-serine is of the menu for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17d0css/would_a_bad_reaction_to_glycine_mean_that_dserine/

My question is, would it be beneficial to take this at night on days I workout on? Just to aid in better recovery? Wondering if cycling on and off would be better for controlling the side effects or if spiking IGF-1 for a few days straight then not taking it on weekends would do more harm than good?
