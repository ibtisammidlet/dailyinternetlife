taktician-653,"I also used to lucid dream pretty regularly (3-4) times per week during college years (it took a while of training).

When I first started taking TAK-653 regularly, I would have extremely vivid dreams if i took it in late afternoon (and still do if I take it that late). About 40% of the time it resulted in lucid dreams with a high degree of contextual awareness.

Combine it with citicoline and tropisetron and I imagine lucid dreaming would come pretty easily. In fact, I’ll try that tonight lol",1696468399,k3iixfk,t3_1701kxu,t3_1701kxu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lord_weasel,"There’s a book called Projection of the Astral Body by Sylvan Muldoon that has invaluable information about how projection, dreams, and how we fall asleep and what physical factors play into one’s ability to remain conscious while moving into other mental states. Something that stood out to me is his focus on the heart rate, and how drugs that prevent your heart rate from dropping enough during sleep will prevent projection and lucid dreaming. It started making sense why my past experiences with things that relax you, like phenibut hcl, can influence lucid dreaming and projection in a positive way, but I found while they made my dreams vivid, I didn’t learn how to do it better and ultimately didn’t have control. I’ve personally found that, while supplements or drugs can help improve memory, recall, or vividness, nothing actually helps you become conscious in those mental states. Proper suggestion and training your conscious mind to click into awareness at the right time is the only straightforward way to accomplish it. Supplements really muddy everything up, imo. I’d wager that you’d be better off learning to properly lucid dream or project first, and then consider a supp or drug to increase recall clarity if you find it’s necessary by that point.",1696670564,k3tyuev,t3_1701kxu,t3_1701kxu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Wise-_-Spirit,"Lemon Balm Extract with Fish Oil never fails for me!

Legitimate_Banana512,"You mention 2 different sleeping issues. Logically there would thus also be substances that could help one but damage the other. Which is exactly what you are doing.

From the 2 sleeping problems:  
-getting rejuvinative sleep.  
-getting lucid dreams.  
... it would be logical to first tackle tackling the former, the more urgent one.

Substances you use that do that, but in turn decrease your lucid dreams are: Weed, Benzo

Replace those with substances that help both. Substances that help both are rare, but you can find them for them being in regards to the term: 'sleep hyerarchiture'. Weed doesn't help, because it's mainly THC. But some other cannabinoid: CBN, or it's more potent bother: CBNo, are really promosing for that.

Also 5-htp helps me A LOT with getting rejuvinative sleep

Tianeptine seems to induce the most lucid rem sleeps without noticably reducing rejuvinating sws",1696666490,k3ttr4p,t3_1701kxu,t3_1701kxu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
