When I was in high school and early uni years, I was really into lucid dreaming. I loved it. Letâ€™s say I could control like 80% of a dream and sometimes wake myself up when I realizing Iâ€™m dreaming haha.

Back then, I was taking 0 substance during the day or before bed, not even sure about coffee.

Thereâ€™s a whole mÃ©thode and things to do several times a day (look at your hand, a clock, journal your dreams). My favorite one Â«Â transferred me from wakefulness to a lucid dreamÂ Â». It was closing your eyes and only focus on the images/visuals you see with maintained shut eyes. It took some time but it literally took me in a like a water slide to the dream land portal. It was a visual / psyche experience almost. 

:(  Then sleep issues developed and I started taking like 0,25mg Alpra to sleep and it was fine. Weed was also amazing for this purpose. Alcohol had terrible effects on my sleep.

 > Never abused benzos, really almost only used them for sleep, i do not feel anything recreational about it. Not necessarily a good strategy but I switch between alprazolam, Bromazolam, pyrazolamâ€¦ ðŸ˜¢ still no dreaming or at least dream recalls. 

I also sometimes take, theralene, Tercian, 

And Zopiclone is cool for sleep. 80% of the time, I swallowed it and fell asleep in the next few minutes, even without feeling sleepy a bit, i find it so efficient in this way but i the love drifting into sleep while being tired. I took it for 2 or 3 years straight maybe. Didnâ€™t not take the time to study long terme adverse effects.

 > Absolutely no dreaming, lucid dreaming or having nightmares on it this molecule.

> The only dreams I can recall are those following naps (very rare). Thereâ€™s an explanation for that but i forgot, cause fkng bad decisions about depending on benzos to sleep

> Melatonin isnâ€™t sufficient to sleep for me 

// I would really go back into the LUCID DREAMING world and would appreciate any advice, sleep hygiene ritual or hygiene (not browsing Reddit!before sleep, lmprovement to be made on dreaming with molecules or trying to remember and journal them and finally your very honest opinion about the nootropics and supplements, lots of money soent

// substances recommendations?
