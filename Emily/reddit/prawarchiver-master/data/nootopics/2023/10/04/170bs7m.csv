nutritionacc,I'm not sure what information you're basing these conclusions on. Tianeptine was primitively classified as an SSRE before it was discovered that this action was erroneously determined and then was reclassified as an atypical mu opioid agonist.,1696526450,k3lng3w,t3_170bs7m,t3_170bs7m,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Intellimeds description of substance says: ""Tianeptine is mainly used in the treatment anxiety in depression disorders. In contrast to other antidepressants, Tianeptine increases serotonin uptake and is therefore known to reduce stress. A review of its use has shown its efficacy and favorable tolerability in patients suffering depression. Additionally, data shows that it has more potential for people suffering alcoholism. \[1\]"" 

So, increased serotonin uptake (by contrast to how typical SSRI meds work) could explain greater demand for 5htp or tryptophan.

""Tianeptine is an antidepressant agent with a novel neurochemical profile. It increases serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) uptake in the brain (in contrast with most antidepressant agents) and reduces stress-induced atrophy of neuronal dendrites.

Efik_Pail,"...and what's a bit comical (or sad) is that it's still defined as an SSRE in many recent medical books in countries where Tianeptine is a prescription drug.

That's not a criticism towards Tianeptine itself. It's the only thing which really cured my depression (prescribed and supervised by a competent doctor and at low doses: 12mg twice a day)...it's just that I'm a bit perplex to see outdated conceptions still teached in medecine universities.",1696532444,k3m4hso,t3_170bs7m,t1_k3lng3w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"That's right, side effects may happen and their frequency is very well documented. And that's right, some of them are harsh. 
I just said that ""I did not experienced any side effect"", not the slightest one, to be honest and when I stoppedit after two years without any tapering, I did not experience any problem. 

But that's just an anecdotal report : obviously, I would not say that are no side effects. I'm surely not advocating taking Tianeptine for every person who suffers from depression, let's be clear.

And yes, we all know that Tianeptine may be very addictive to some people (there are quite a lot of horror stories about it on Reddit), especially to people who have a past with addictions. 
It's the kind of substance which can do wonders on resistant depressions when other more common ones failed but it should only be taken with great care and under supervision. In my country, it needs a secured prescription (28 days max by prescription).",1696591992,k3pb5me,t3_170bs7m,t1_k3oguwn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

nutritionacc,"Wow!

I dont understand why information presented in academic textbooks is still passes as one of the most reputable forms of medical literature. It goes against the very nature of science; ever-changing and never certain. Even Wikipedia respects this dogma.",1696534420,k3ma3jw,t3_170bs7m,t1_k3m4hso,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"That's right! But if you have some time to loose, please check a translation in your native language of the Tianeptine page of the ""Vidal"", the reference book for medecine doctors in France....you may be surprised...or appalled! (Unless it has been corrected in the latest editions, but let me doubt of it)

That's greatly ironic as Tianeptine is a French creation ,(made by Servier Labs In the 60's)

I have to be clear: Tianeptine has been a godsend to me (SSRI were quite ineffective for me and only Tianeptine and Bromantane really helped): it made me feel  way better, without any kind of side effects at low doage, but I'm quite bit skeptical when medical doctors (some of them being university teachers) still present it as an SSRE...
Even I (French teacher, specialist in medieval Literature..
Not a chemist at all) sees it as a non-nense, and I remain quite polite....",1696545956,k3n54k0,t3_170bs7m,t1_k3ma3jw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
AromaticPlant8504,Ok thanks for clarifying. I literally didn’t know how to word it so as to not come across as if I was assuming the worst so I gave an example dose. Obviously didn’t work lmao,1696736765,k3y19ag,t3_170bs7m,t1_k3xbt7d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
