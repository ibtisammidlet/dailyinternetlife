I'm taking 2000mg Sarcosine and 2000mg NAC every morning, and then polygala tenuifolia 200mg in AM and 100mg in late afternoon. I'm also on Zoloft 150mg daily and 200mg Modafanil daily, but hoping to reduce those (or stop them) with continued good results from the others. Thoughts on if I should and how best to cycle them?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Cycling?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17kosdr/cycling/
