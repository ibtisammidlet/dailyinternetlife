SunDevil329,"I doubt it's necessary to cycle NAC, but I know some do. Polygala I'd say no need. Not familiar enough with sarcosine.

Unclear if you were asking about the Zoloft and modafinil as well. I wouldn't adjust your Zoloft dosage without approval from your doc (unless you're just quitting). For modafinil, yes, ideally you'd want to cycle to some extent to maintain effectiveness.",1698777480,k79ic39,t3_17kosdr,t3_17kosdr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
heyjude900,"Thank you! Was just wondering about the NAC, sarcosine, and polygala. I'm not letting the other two prescribed meds go until I feel well and talk to my doctor.",1698778154,k79k6il,t3_17kosdr,t1_k79ic39,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Safest_Traveller,"Iirc it's best to cycle NAC just a bit (take for like 3-4 weeks and take a week off) because it inhibits the absorption of copper and people have had issues with copper deficiency as a result of chronic NAC use without breaks. I also take it at 1300mg a day and I start feeling physically off if I take it everyday for too long without pause, I would assume from that issue, or something else related as it seems to disappear when I stop NAC for just a little bit before resuming",1698814455,k7bubvw,t3_17kosdr,t1_k79k6il,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,Would a supplemental copper (e.g. 2 mg copper chelate) taken at a separate time be able to prevent that?,1698891016,k7gcw29,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7bubvw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Safest_Traveller,"Also as far as the SSRIs go, I was on them for a bit, and this is the stack that kept me level while tapering off and after

Daily: 

-300-500mg L-Theanine
-300-600mg Magnesium (Elemental: from Mg Glycinate)
-1.3g NAC
-1.5g ALCAR
-1.2g Alpha-GPC

Occasionally:

-200-300mg Caffeine
-100-200mg Ketamine

If taking all this I would also add Allicin (garlic extract) if I had the foresight, both ALCAR and Alpha-GPC increase TMAO but Allicin kills the bacteria responsible for TMAO production.",1698851106,k7dg1yp,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7ddh7x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Safest_Traveller,"I'm not certain, but IIRC it messes with the transporter, so any copper wouldn't get taken in. I would cycle it personally",1698934401,k7ic7tl,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7gcw29,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"That makes sense, thanks.  I’ve also heard it can deplete selenium and molybdenum.  Possibly iodine too.

On a positive note though, it can also remove heavy metals.

Personally I cycle NAC though…mainly use it when expecting some neurotoxicity (e.g. taking a prescription stimulant)",1698936064,k7igko8,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7ic7tl,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Safest_Traveller,"Real, I didn't know about the other depletions, thanks for the info

Also didn't know about heavy metals, that could come in handy

And im on both NAC and Adderall right now LMAO",1698943941,k7j22f8,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7igko8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"It does stack well with Adderall.  

Slightly Takes the edge off, slightly reduces the comedown….nothing significant though.  

And of course neuroprotection.

What else is in your stack?",1698946059,k7j7x6i,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7j22f8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Safest_Traveller,"Well it depends on the day

Daily, I take
400mg L-Theanine

300mg Magnesium (Elemental, from Glycinate)

1.3g NAC

1.5g ALCAR

1.2g Alpha-GPC


Sometimes I'll add 200-300mg Caffeine (or any other stims), in which case I'll take 500-600mg of L-Theanine instead of 400

I dose with 15mg Adderall here and there, maybe twice a month on average

I also use ketamine 2-4 times a month at about 125-200mg insufflated",1698946264,k7j8hq2,t3_17kosdr,t1_k7j7x6i,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
