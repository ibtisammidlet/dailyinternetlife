Hxmusa,"PPAP consistently causes hypomania for me if I’ve had a break from it in a very enjoyable way, Phenylpiracetam does sometimes. NSI causes hypomania in a horrible way at some times leading to emotional breakdowns. Bromantane causes hypomania in a way where I feel restless until some task has been completed leading into another task then another one and this could be exhausting if you’re just trying to relax. At other times it’s really useful.

NAC, Lithium Orotate, and Agmatine in that order reverses manic thinking and symptoms for me leading into a calm flow state instead.",1698866305,k7elc0d,t3_17lg8cj,t3_17lg8cj,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
