Efik_Pail,"Just an anecdotal report, not a medical advice:

I did not experience any negative interaction (no I traction at all) between TAK and the SSRI I used to take (Escitalopram). But the Escitalopram dose was very low (5 to 10mg)/ a day).

As far as I know, they work on completely different paths


I don't know Gabapentin, sorry.",1696760028,k3yy3mt,t3_172ggcu,t3_172ggcu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
bostocked,There is limited evidence that gabapentin may inhibit synaptogenesis In certain brain regions if based on a different pathway perhaps TAK may nullify or reverse this but I would have no way of testing.,1696787276,k40mrgq,t3_172ggcu,t3_172ggcu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
e59e59,"From a simplified view, TAK and gabapentin are opposites (pro vs anti calcium influx, excitatory vs inhibitory, pro vs anti neurogenic). Not necessarily a dangerous combination, but likely an ineffective and irrelevant one. Since you also deal with anxiety TAK probably isn't the best option at the moment,  neboglamine and/or tropisetron could be an option.",1696713752,k3wmdyu,t3_172ggcu,t3_172ggcu,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
MarionberryAnnual949,If I have OCd can I take Tak? I saw an old post saying. That was not a good idea,1696722157,k3x5u3l,t3_172ggcu,t3_172ggcu,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

heyjude900,"I was VERY interested in Neboglamine, myself. It also sounded very promising. Unfortunately, I don't know where to find it except through Everychem, and they have no stock. What are your thoughts with either Tak-653 or Neboglamine being taken with an SSRI? I worry about toxicity or Serotonin Syndrome, or some other problem, even though I know these two meds have completely different modes of action. Anxiety much?

heyjude900,"I did see that as well, but I don't think it was science-backed, if that makes sense, since it is not out of clinical trials yet. However, due to its mechanism of action, possibly?",1696722541,k3x6ox8,t3_172ggcu,t1_k3x5u3l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ModerateSizeTiger,LOL damn. I take Gabapentin towards end of the day cause it takes edge off for me and makes my executive function better actually lol.,1697072437,k4hzyay,t3_172ggcu,t1_k499cfd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
e59e59,"There shouldn't be any problem, if anything there's antidepressive synergy. For me both TAK-653 and neboglamine have been beneficial only for cognition so far though.


Sarcosine I think is in stock and shares similarities with neboglamine, if you're looking to try something immediately that's an option.",1696716876,k3wtu61,t3_172ggcu,t1_k3ws70z,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
no-google-no-cry,Gabapentin was my least favorite drug.   It was iq- in a pill   only worse is Pregabalin.,1697074416,k4i4n3y,t3_172ggcu,t1_k4hzyay,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
heyjude900,"I haven't even really looked at Sarcosine before.  I just now looked at a couple of PubMed studies and sounds a little promising. Sounds like the seizure threshold is a little lower in this one, but maybe a good one to try. Looks like they also haven't done much study on it for depression, but for some reason they sure have been finding that antipsychotics help as an adjunct in depression. Have you tried it? I might. It's not that I necessarily want something now, but the Neboglamine doesn't give any idea how long it will be or if it will return, and I have no idea if there are any other suppliers. That's why initially I thought Tak might be a good alternative.",1696722257,k3x623i,t3_172ggcu,t1_k3wtu61,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
