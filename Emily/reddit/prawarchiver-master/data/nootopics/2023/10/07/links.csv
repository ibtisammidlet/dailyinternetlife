I know that no one can give medical advice here, and I am not expecting that, but hoping someone can give me their anecdotal experience, or offer a scientific perspective? I'm really wanting to try TAK-653. To me, it sounds like a complete game changer for my life, but I am currently taking 150mg Zoloft daily and 1800mg Gabapentin daily and want to make sure it is safe to take with TAK-653? I struggle severely with MDD and anxiety, with a previous history of substance abuse, and have never felt whole since becoming clean 3 years ago.
