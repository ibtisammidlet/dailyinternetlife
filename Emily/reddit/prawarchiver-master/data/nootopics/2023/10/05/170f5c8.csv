GlitteringAirport938,"Tbh, the best thing to do for that is a combination of daily stretching/strengthening exercises for your wrists and fingers coupled with supplements to reduce inflammation and oxidation (the 2 main culprits for tendon/nerve degeneration and stiffness). You can find exercises on YouTube pretty easy, you don't need anything fancy. Patience and consistency are the most important things here. As for supplements, you can use fish oil, shilajit, spirulina, vitamin C, bacopa monnieri, ginkgo biloba (also good for improving microcirculation), and turmeric/curcumin (either with black pepper extract or liposomal).",1696540897,k3msd6e,t3_170f5c8,t3_170f5c8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

TQ_Piotr,"GW-501516 is the best for endurance hands down. Not really a nootropic, but gives a strong increase in endurance for sure. Not sure about using it for your specific purpose tho",1696563293,k3o88oh,t3_170f5c8,t3_170f5c8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
polgesteirg,I’m also going to start taking Alcar. Is creatine good if I’m not specifically looking for muscle building?,1696553808,k3nnh1y,t3_170f5c8,t1_k3lt7vj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

polgesteirg,"I gotta look more into the specifics but logically speaking I don't see why training one type would generally prevent someone from using the other. I don't think when doing a specific activity you'd be able to use both, but generally there should be no way for you to be unable to train both? 

Wondering this just makes me realize how little I know about anatomy in general. I guess it varies from case to case but what would be the size where there starts to not be enough space for both types to continue growing, if any? I would assume Olympic level so nowhere near mine lol",1696633392,k3s7ozh,t3_170f5c8,t1_k3rqtrp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
