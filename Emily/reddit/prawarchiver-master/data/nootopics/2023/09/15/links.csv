According to the description of this compound:  

“3,3,-Diphenylcyclobutanamine is a psychostimulant drug which was originally prepared as an antidepressant in the late 1970s. It appears to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and may also induce their release as well.”  

Oddly enough this is pretty much the only information I acquired about the drug. I’m very intrigued about it and I’m hoping anybody who came across this can share any further details about it.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Any insight/experiences with 3,3-Diphenylcyclobutanamine?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16jxzza/any_insightexperiences_with/
