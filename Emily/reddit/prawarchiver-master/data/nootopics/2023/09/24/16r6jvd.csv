roco-j,"I know it's unrelated to your question, unfortunately I have no experience with Black Seed Oil.

I just wanted to ask, did you also try Bromantane? 

I think everyone on this subreddit discovered for either ALCAR and/or Bromantane that's why I ask. But personally I didn't like the effect that ALCAR (albeit smaller dose than 2g) had on me. So I was curious to hear your experience, since you seem to fare well on ALCAR.",1695726230,k29m3eh,t3_16r6jvd,t3_16r6jvd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I don't think BSO will have the contradictions you have mentioned",1695800098,k2ego7g,t3_16r6jvd,t3_16r6jvd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MrNeverEverKnew,Sadly Bromantane is forbidden and unavailable in my country or near by countries. I really wanted to try it for years. Never have been able to do so. Same for Sulbutiamine or other great promising supplements :(,1696096400,k2w3s9z,t3_16r6jvd,t1_k29m3eh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
