sirsadalot,"Nobody is saying TAK-653 is safe only because it's a selective AMPA PAM, because I know that's what you're referencing. It's safe because the preclinical rodent and non human data proved its safety and it did really well on phase 1 clinical trials. If you're going to try and raise a legitimate criticism towards it, you should be more specific as to what you're actually concerned over instead of making blanket statements and giving opinions.

Using phase 1 as a standard for nootropics is good because this is a massive leap from preclinical. Not only is this make or break for a lot of drugs but it also shows confidence in the development team. 

Is there a percent chance that something can go wrong with larger scale human studies with hundreds of people? Sure. But far less likely than with something that hasn't even been given nor passed phase 1 clinical trials.

Furthermore the selectivity to the AMPA allosteric site was meant to rule out seizure induction and cognitive impairment specifically. It is proof of concept by Takeda, and there's not much more you can do to prove it at this point.

Until we can get it to the point that pharmaceutical companies can profit from selling nootropics, we have less to go off of. I can't tell you how many potentially great drugs I've had to leave behind due to no phase 1 trials.",1695695161,k289rh7,t3_16rxjqv,t3_16rxjqv,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,I’m not really sure what’s the point of this in a nootropics sub. We’ll all be dead and gone before there’s “hard evidence” for the majority of nootropics or supplements out there.,1695680477,k279n5w,t3_16rxjqv,t3_16rxjqv,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
caffeinehell,"And yet some substances like the peptide MIF-1 will never be studied bevause they cannot be patented. 

You cannot rely on trials for everything. Things like SSRI, Finasteride, Ozempic, and more were “safe” in trials and are all associated with anhedonia/blunting/severe sexual issues. Yea even Ozempic if you look up “ozempic suicidal thoughts” you will see the EMA is investigating it now. 

Things are hidden in trials and good drugs often never make it. Eg Zuranolone did not get approved for MDD",1695661761,k25t41o,t3_16rxjqv,t3_16rxjqv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
financeben,When there’s not going to be trials you have to revert to mechanistic data. Good physicians do this when faced with trouble.

Melodic-Ad5922,"I wasn't attempting to cover up a criticism of a specific molecule with a blanket statement but I can 100% see how you'd see that from my above statement. I was more using it as an example because it's well known within this community and it's quite novel. I agree we've gotten a lot better in creating testable premises through past mechanistic data which was in turn found in the same way. This sort of process is how science progresses. However, I disagree with the idea that TAK-653 should be used for recreational purposes. There's simply too many unknowns compared to unknown benefits. For example, methlyphenidate has been widely prescribed and there's been a wealth of data. However, until recently there's been this wide acceptance that Methylphenidate is simple and mechanistically easy to explain in relation to its benefit to adhd. It's quite convenient when a substance is simply a silent antagonist of just DAT and NET. The mechanistic consequences are easier to find since there's less confounding variables. However, even after years of past epidemiology there's been many conflicting examples of a not so simple methlyphenidate. Also, beyond nootropic effects some of these substances could have negative effects which we can explain mechanistically and have been observed. I've noticed especially in these past few months that people are heavily biased and lead lives filled with logical contradiction. We avoid the unknown dangers of some activities but will engage in others. Although this is simply a belief, I believe drugs to be quite similar, the data isn't there yet for us to be using substances for improvement. Also, mice and rat data often poorly translates into humans. Also, there's many statistical problems in small clinical trials of less than 200 people. You need to look at quality of outcomes not of quality of mechanics. If there's no quality of outcomes why take the risk?",1695696238,k28ca6m,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k289rh7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Melodic-Ad5922,"You're not quite grasping what I'm trying to say. I'm gonna simplify what I'm trying to say which makes it lose a lot of its context. Unless you're fixing a problem ie ADHD with stimulants or depression with SSRIs then the risk to reward ratio with most if these substances is quite poor. There's evidence of effectiveness in the human construct of intelligence, in relation to medications like methlyphenidate, with a vast saftey profile, with vast quantities of empirical evidence. Yet people invest money and time to improve an already functioning system with a great unknown with a vast danger profile.",1695689202,k27v32r,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k279n5w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Melodic-Ad5922,"I appreciate the comment, the point I'm making goes beyond merely proving saftey within clinical trials. Also, those medications are used to treat specific conditions, they each arguably have a greater benefit/disbenefit ratio. However, the point of my post above was to establish that when making a change within a system, to attempt to improve it, without any evidence of an improvement, without evidence of potential harms, or without an understanding of the system in its totality, has a greater danger/benefit ratio and should not be proceeded. It's like attempting to improve a car with a superficial understanding of the vehicle itself, it's a lot easier to find a problem and reverse it rather than solving future problems or improving the system as a whole. That's the reason pharmaceuticals are used to treat conditions rather than prevent them. Through empirical evidence, it's incredibly difficult to find a chain of causality and establish a mechanistic explanation for a treatment in such a complex system with a vast array of variables. There's greater room for error in changing a system with uncertainty. This means that side effects will go overlooked, benefit is difficult to determine, etc. It's far easier to fix a problem within a broken system because as soon as you do you see it running correctly again, but when adding something to an already functioning system you need to find a chain of causality to find a benefit.",1695662584,k25vgp8,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k25t41o,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"If we're to assume you're still talking about TAK-653 there is a study where it improved cognition in healthy people. And there are studies with other ampa pams where they improved cognition in healthy people, repeatedly, with other drugs.

Methylphenidate isn't a silent antagonist at DAT, it is an inverse agonist like cocaine which is why it releases dopamine in scale with dose and can cause conditioned place preference to the extent it does.

You're making a comparison between Methylphenidate and tak-653 but the difference in scientific advances between when it was created and tak are insane. There's a massive time gap. Everything has improved since then and predictions have improved with them, but we have more than predictions to go off of as well. So logically it doesn't make sense to make that your example.

You're saying we can explain consequences mechanistically but haven't given any examples and that also contradicts your overarching statement that drawing a relationship of data from a mechanism is bad.

You also generalize nootropics saying there isn't a wealth of data when for some of them that are decades old there is. For example Piracetam, CDP-Choline and D-Serine.

The definition of nootropic as per Corneliu implies that it must be safe and low in side effects, so if something contradicts that, then it is no longer a nootropic.",1695700010,k28kc5n,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k28ca6m,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,"I mean, it’s just rubbish. Simply because a particular compound is under-researched doesn’t really mean that we should assume that it has a high probability of being toxic especially if we can’t fathom what mechanism would make that substance dangerous.",1695689449,k27votc,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k27v32r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Melodic-Ad5922,"I apologize I was sort of working off the presumption that when referring to nootropics we meant substances people on reddit call nootropics not it's actual definition. For an example of a mechanistic explanation for side effects: atomoxetine was observed to be correlated with sudden cardiac events and was hypothesized to be acting in potassium channels and when tested it turned out to be correct and it extended to analogs of atomoxetine as well. The point I was making with methylphenidate is that for years it was assumed to be a silent antagonist but turned out to be an inverse agonist. Also, it has been found to have some relation to NMDA causing a NMDA dependent agonism of the Sigma 1 receptor likely contributing to its addictive potential and increased calcium channel opening. What if TAK-653 is similar where we only look for evidence to align with the much better fantasy of allosteric modulation. However, while I have you here I've found continually conflicting answers on this question. I have a side question as well which is different from the current topic: wouldn't chronic adensoine antagonism lead to a chronic D2 agonism subsequently causing a downregulation of the D2 receptor thereby reducing basal dopamine levels and, arent the D1 receptor family supperior anyway making the A1 receptor a better target? I do believe that TAK-653 to be the most promising of all substances but there's little to no data on it from independent companies. Also, I'd worry about the AMPA's relation to mTOR since mTOR is associated with reduced life span. However, this is all correlation.",1695735610,k2a5cja,t3_16rxjqv,t1_k28kc5n,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
