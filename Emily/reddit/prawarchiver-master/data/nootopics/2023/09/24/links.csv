(You may skip the first paragraph if you'd like)

Paragraph 1
As the title states, mechanistic data is used to generate hypotheses not be acted upon.
These hypotheses are used to conduct clinical trials to establish a greater understanding of the system (the human body). Especially with pharmaceuticals in relation to neurology, there's very little understanding of the brain in its totality. General life advice, there's 2 types of evidence empirical and mechanistic. Empirical is evidence from observation. Mechanistic is evidence derived through following a chain of causality using past empirical observations (following a chain of cause and effect till you reach a desired point) to then repeat the process. In order to prove something you must first generate a statement and attempt to prove it. Humans, unlike computers, don't have the cognitive capabilities to continually cross out failed explanations. Rather, humans look for evidence which confirms their hypothesis. However, humans are heavily biased and we often look in the rear view mirror rather than behind us.

Paragraph 2
The problem occurs when people are generating significant life choices, ie taking substances. These substances they take often have very little evidence in regards to saftey. Especially with novel drugs like AMPA positive allosteric modulators, there's empirical evidence to prove saftey (phase 1 clinical trials) but we shouldn't use these to confirm our hypothesis that the drug is safe. When there's a lack of evidence in relation to understanding a system in its totality, you should never draw definite conclusions. In the field of medicine it's generally accepted that with our current understanding of the system (the body) it's not definite that drugs are safe. This is when you weigh the balance of harms and goods. When a drug has more harms than goods it is not prescribed. For example, cancer, chemotherapy has a vast side effect profile: shortened life span, decreased IQ, etc but, these harms don't out wiegh the good of being alive. Now in relation to nootropics, there's no definite conclusion to whether the substances are safe (generally), and the benefits often aren't very great, and when they are great, they should be doubted as to their actual benefit as the human brain is heavily biased. People who take amphetamine believe that their IQ is increased but, often it actually impairs it. To conclude, I believe that people should be more risk adverse prior to taking these substances.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Mechanistic Data Isn't Hard Evidence,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16rxjqv/mechanistic_data_isnt_hard_evidence/

2000mg of ALCAR + 1500mg of Gotu Kola + 320mg of Bacopa (Doctor‘s Best Synapsa)

Diagnosed and reason of supplementing:

Treatment-resistant depression and Social Anxiety

My success with this stack:

I‘m dosing this for about 40 days now, sometimes like once weekly a day off and once in my whole experimenting I went 5 days off in a row to see if it comes with any withdrawal or rebound.

There was no issue being off of it after the intake as described above. I also didn‘t experience any side effects except for some insomnia that happens sometimes but is not that bad that I would see it as an issue for what this stack gives me.

My depression and social anxiety decreased drastically, this stuff is really powerful. I have a better mood, laugh more, am more sociable, talkative, jokey, less socially awkward, less depressed or anxious about the future and past, I feel cognitively sharper, much better memory, more focus, better attention and bigger drive - and I feel way more fit and energetic, physically as well as mentally.

It‘s been one of the greatest stacks I’ve tried so far. That‘s it and it‘s been better than any antidepressant (and I‘ve tried over 14 psychiatric prescription meds, many different docs, 2 depth-analytical therapies, 1 cognitive-behavioral therapy, alternative therapies as hypnosis etc. and nothing helped this well and continuously).

My issue / question:

Now I‘m thinking of adding another compound: Black Seed Oil. I remember that once I really took it rigorously and constantly disciplined like a teaspoon of unfiltered 2-3x day, I also felt a big improvement in my depression and social anxiety. So I wanna try adding this to improve my mental health and yearlong misery of hating my life, being unable ble to do normal stuff and thinking about death even more.

Anyone knows if it‘s OK to add Black Seed Oil to ALCAR, Gotu Kola and Bacopa - or how it might affect these - any risks/dangers/interactions?  Pharmacologically as well as from own experiences? I know BSO might be dangerous if used daily by possibly affecting GABA too much, but how big is this risk or may I reduce it by taking breaks like 2 weeks on 2 weeks off?

Thanks for any help and best wishes y‘all!",False,t5_4aoxhu,I need help with my own Mr. Happy Stack,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16r6jvd/i_need_help_with_my_own_mr_happy_stack/
