Upset_Scientist3994,"Iboga derivatives upregulate GDNF neurotropic factor in VTA, what reboots dopamine system and increases it. GDNF is sometimes also been tried as a injection for Parkinson disease and shows very long term benefits afterwards. I am intrested of DNSP-11 peptide what is kind of mimetic of GDNF for that purpose, as Iboga derivatives are not so availible except for microdosing. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21040239/",1695218382,k1f11jg,t3_16l6qfb,t3_16l6qfb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
