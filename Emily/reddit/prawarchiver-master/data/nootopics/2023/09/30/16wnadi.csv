Fine-Tale2468,"/u/carebear6590 I'm sorry anxiety is a challenge for you. Been there. 

NA Selank or NA Selank Amidate is perfect for anxiety. Intranasal. 

I saw Bromantane mentioned and it may be helpful but works better for fatigue. It might actually amp you up so please be careful with that.

I'd highly recommend Carnosic Acid. CA is very safe and well tolerated. It has so many amazing properties including anxiolytic, anti inflammatory and even has anti bacterial properties. It's often used to help people get off benzos. Every Chem sells it in a powder. No pills. 

If you are into bio hacking a calming device like Sensate or Pulsetto is awesome. I have both. Pulsetto works the best for me. 

I work in a brain specialty clinic and am a 2x long Covid survivor and no more anxiety. Reach out if you need help.

GlitteringAirport938,"I think what he means is that if your life has plenty of real anxiety inducing components going on, looking for an exogenous substance to make it go away isn't a proper long term solution. Although I agree with that point, I do think anxiety can make it so that we can't tackle these anxiety inducing conponents well. Therefore, the proper solution is to find something to make the situation manageable, with the intention to work through the anxiety inducing components, once your mind is calm enough to process them and find real solutions.

This is why brain boosters tend to work well for anxiety. It's not that a boosted brain feels no anxiety, but rather that the boosted brain organically finds better ways to approach the anxiety inducing problems, reaching solutions that reduce the anxiety.

t0sspin,"Unfortunately lack of official literature is not sufficient to base risk appetite off of, for a number of reasons in this case.

Sure Ashwagandha has been around for years, but only recently has it exploded in popularity, along with far more potent products/standardized extracts. With the increase in popularity of the herb and the higher potency, it is only logical that if there were potential for an issue that more individual cases will arise which we are seeing anecdotally. It will take time (years and years) for these to be documented in literature, and frankly most of these will never be documented.

I suffer from PSSD, a condition very similar to what Ashwagandha can cause except worse (it is possible there could be similar mechanisms at play). 

Having inadequate literature in the past did not stop me from getting PSSD. Now more and more literature is coming out about it and validating its existence.

This is not to say that everybody that takes SSRIs or Ashwagandha will develop persistent/permanent side effects. It will be a minority. However the existence of the possibility is more than enough to warrant offering every single person wanting to take either the decency of having informed consent in making their decision as to whether to take them or not.

If I had known there was even a 1/10,000 chance of what happened to me happening to me (in reality the odds are dramatically higher than that)  I would have chosen not to take what I took.
