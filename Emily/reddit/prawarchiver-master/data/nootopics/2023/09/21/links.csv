Morning:

Bromantane 14mg sublingual

Selegiline 2.5mg sublingual

ALCAR 400mg

Agmatine 800mg

50mg NALC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine-ethyl-ester)

1-3 bags of tea (usually mint or saffron green tea, or black/earl grey. Matcha or yerba mate if I have the time and energy.) 

Vitamin D 2000ug (prescribed, deficient) 

CBD vape (broad spec, under 0.2% THC but very celebral and mood-lifting) 

400mg alpha-GPC



----------------------------------------



Night (this combo makes me pretty groggy in the morning but it works):

Melatonin 2-3mg (sublingual oil and oral) 

CBN 15mg + CBD 15mg (sublingual oil) 

Atarax 25mg (Antihistamine/allergy medicine, prescribed off-label for insomnia/anxiety) 

Oleamide 220mg

Tetrohydropalmatine 29mg

Vit C 40mg (part of liftmode sleep caps) 

This is pretty much everything for my daily or near-daily stack. 

Might just replace my NALC with NAC after a while but so far I'm really liking it for addiction and mood stability so I might just keep using NALC knowing this one works for me. 

I also have a daily cannabis habit mostly in the evenings, I am cutting down with dry-herb vapes and CBD, knowing that a daily high-THC habit is disruptive for the long term even though it helps my stress, anxiety and depression issues. 

Daily nicotine vaping habit, from snus to vaping and been addicted to nicotine for too long but it feels like a smaller vice than daily cannabis use so I'm just observing the habit right now, may reduce nicotine in my homemade juices over time. 

I also have lots of piracetam, noopept and a sample of sunifiram that I intend to use more sporadically when I feel like having small cognitive boost. (these powders last me forever though, usually tea is enough.) 

I also use l-theanine weekly for anxiety, caffeine jitters or relaxing teas. Also phenibut for days I know will be really difficult, but I try to use it as sparingly as possible and I'm against using it as a necessary crutch for difficult things in life unless it's a daily habit. I use it 0 to 3 times per week, one 290 mg scoop or one more depending on the day.

I want to get into more herbs and supplements but right now I don't think I want to complicate my stack any more than this, unless there's something plain neuroprotective with a very low chance of negative interactions. 

And sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile and it's gets harder if you don't know the BB code.
