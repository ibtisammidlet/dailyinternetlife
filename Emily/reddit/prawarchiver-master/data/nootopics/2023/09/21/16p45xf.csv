Efik_Pail,"Hello, 
I don't know if it would not be excessive to talk about eidetic memory for this compound, but PRL-8-53 seems to have very powerful enhancing memory properties.

Never tried but I plan to.

Seems to have quite few side effects and to be well tolerated, but they are extremely few studies about it and some people mention social avoidance while you are on it. (Not necessarily a big deal, if it's for studying)",1695377683,k1oy0yk,t3_16p45xf,t3_16p45xf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"There is no withdrawal reported.
But be aware that PRL-8-53, even it's absolutely not a new compound, is an experimental compound.
There are quite a lot of anecdotal reports about it, but very few studies.",1695670700,k26iq5t,t3_16p45xf,t1_k24y5hp,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
