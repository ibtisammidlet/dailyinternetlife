SavedByGhosts,"Any thought on ISRIB for this stack? Not sure if I'm adding another synthetic compound, much less an experimental one. But it sounds like it might be good candidate for stress, memory and neuroprotective effects. 

Definitely need to research everything I can about it and gain an understanding of why one might prefer it in a stack like mine before I even begin considering being an early candidate ü§î. But it sounds very good on paper, unless I need to go for the injection route (sublingual or liquid IN only).

I think it's as far as I'll go with nootropics and ISRIB is a little bit outside of my comfort zone, but it's definitely in the realm of what I'm seeking. It's surprisingly common in Europe like other unusual experimental nootropics from our post-soviet neighbors, as well as Russia and China.

SavedByGhosts,"I've had a few brushes with more potent stimulants and this isn't it in that regard, I'm on day 2 of selegiline. It's gonna get more potent, so I am definitely lowering the dose if it becomes a proper euphoriant or if I notice disassociation and delusion in any way. This form of stimulation is almost outside of my comfort zone, think I might lower the dose or just wait and see. 

I'm gonna squash that euphoria when I see it and do something about it, I've been spared of stimulant abuse so far and I want to keep it that way. Only tried amphetamines in some rare moments of impulsivity with dissapointing effects, I don't really like that vibe but I can see why people like it. Those are probably powerful for me in therapeutic doses but I'm not taking my chances. 

Selegiline feels cleaner than bupropion and I'm kind of worried about the long-term effects of the metabolites. To be really honest, what I'm doing isn't normal at all in psychiatry in my country but low dose selegiline and weaker stimulants for depression also isn't (except for bupropion and maybe effexor counts).

I'm gonna be really careful because I am incredibly calm and concentrated, zero intrusive thoughts, no zoning out like I often do and no impulsivity towards non-productive activities so it's easier to control my habits, it's definitely working much better than I intended and I don't want to become someone else. 

Might be placebo right now but might not be in a week. I notice how I write these long replies without any thought, usually I tend to overthink and throw a tl:dr at the bottom to feel less insecure about my engagement. 

Not all too concerned though in the end, at this point I think schizophrenia and mania can't be unlocked so easily anymore, not with how I used psychedelics and ketamine in my early twenties, and my chronic cannabis use. But I know how drugs of abuse trigger psychotic symptoms and mania and I'm trying to get my head around how to navigate this, with the knowledge that bupropion and low dose stimulants are the things that have worked at the core of my problems.

Edit: All my cannabis cravings are gone after selegiline on day 2 but I am going to bed so I went for some and I am back to normal again, I think I was somewhat overreacting because I simply wasn't being under much influence from cannabis and it does affect my mental capacity.

SavedByGhosts,"It sometimes works very well, I make an effort to meditate and practice breathwork but it's been hard to make them feel natural and if I have panic attacks it's best to vape or have a downer, thankfully it rarely ever happens so no RC anxiolytics or antipsychotics any longer. 

But I'm trying, mindfulness has been the best for me so far and talk therapy and as I get healthier I have a goal of a meditation routine I can hold, breathwork etc.

Didn't have any noticeable side effects from them, but the combo hasn't been good for my memory in retrospect, especially with cannabis and antihistamines. 

NDRIs the only class of ADs that have worked for me and it only amounts to bupropion for me, so I am exploring other options by using low dose selegiline and bromantane for this, definitely subtle but so was bupropion and I'm excited to see what it will do for the long term while I'm working on myself and my professional life.",1695310610,k1kscyj,t3_16oh9km,t1_k1kl69q,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SavedByGhosts,"Definitely considering an adeptogen smoothie, I have a recipe I'm working on (primarily rhodiola rosea, Korean ginseng and saffron which are the adaptogens I react best to), including oils and fibers, black pepper, frozen spinage, hemp oil, CBG, CBD, quercetin and more. 

Really wanna fully embrace the adaptogen hype train, so far it hasn't been as impressive as nootropics but I'm going slowly in like with all my supps. 

I know antihistamines are pretty bad, definitely nitoced it when I was on seroquel off-label for sleep and anxiety. Mirtazapine was also too much for me, too tired and fatigued all the time when I was on either one. 

But benzos, gabapentinoids and z-drugs are the only other ones that have worked reliably and long-term, I have an addictive personality and doctors are too afraid to prescribe, so this is the least antihistaminic combo that I have come up so far that is reliable, the combo is not hard on energy and cognitive performance when I need to be fully functional.
