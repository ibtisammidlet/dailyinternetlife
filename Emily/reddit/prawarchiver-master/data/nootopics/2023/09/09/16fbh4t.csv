o0d,"Your problems are far too severe for anyone to give you advice here, it sounds like you need to see a psychiatrist and perhaps be admitted again. Nootropics can't help you, and anyone suggesting you start taking these sketchy drugs with limited research is acting irresponsibly.

Quite simply it is unlikely that a covid vaccine and a migraine drug would cause such damage. Perhaps every med you took after may have made things worse, but these meds aren't likely to cause permanent damage.

I would maybe see about getting some brain imaging like an MRI scan if you've not already had one. If you have been prescribed anti-seizure meds it's important that you continue to take them as prescribed. It will take time, but if you seek proper help you will likely improve.

I know you don't want to hear this, but it sounds like you have serious mental health issues, and you need to seek professional help.",1694453173,k04xiwa,t3_16fbh4t,t3_16fbh4t,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

Comfortable-Roll4347,"Can you keep a journal, to make notes of the ways you feel?

Daily entries will be helpful, but it's great to write as much as you feel comfortable and able. It can even be basic quick notes if you do not have the time or feel good to write lots of details.

 Mark each entry with the time and date. Record any medication and supplements (the name, and the strength of the dose) you have taken. Also record your food/dietary intake for the day. And maybe too the activities of your day, and if notice any activity that makes your body/mind feel better, feel worse, or become uncomfortable.

Making a journal of how you feel, along with the active medications, and an outline of your diet and activities, will create a very useful and reliable reference point for any future discussions with people who may support you. Whether it is on the professional side or privately with family and friends.

 You will also have a safe space to express in the moments, and create a foundation of information from ""in the moment"", each day, to stay informed and make possible understanding of what is happening in your life.

Journal keeping is very useful for looking back, and then planning ahead. Just a few words to make the record of how you feel, on a date and time, along with related people/places/things involved, may make a difference.

It is supportive and valuable as a tool to validate and verify your experience - you will build your case day by day for your own knowing and for showing others when needed.

This may be especially helpful and empowering as a tool over time if your memory seems to be, not where you want it to be, with recall (which is understandable when living with stress and other conditions.)",1694439018,k03w00z,t3_16fbh4t,t3_16fbh4t,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

NormannNormann,"I took antidepressants for four years, which also did a lot  more harm than good. It took a long time to recover. It's not as bad as your story. But I can still understand how you feel. I also lost many years of my life to it.
I can tell you that if you don't take any medications at all and have a healthy lifestyle, your brain will slowly recover. Proper diet, exercise, a few certain supplements and daily meditation are helpful. Meditation is very good. It has a very healing effect on the brain and absolutely no side effects.
Of course, you must also completely abstain from alcohol, caffeine and other drugs.
I recommend you the book ""Head strong"" by Dave Asprey. The book is about how to heal your brain and improve your cognitive abilities.",1694446953,k04gapo,t3_16fbh4t,t3_16fbh4t,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
