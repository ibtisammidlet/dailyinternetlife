I had a COVID vaccination in December. and had a headache afterwards. I went to the neurologist and he said I have migraines and I've got a triptan. when taking it I became restless and everything in my body tingled. I called my neurologist and then drove there. I told him after the triptan I feel very strong restlessness and tightness in my chest. IT IS ALSO EVERYTHING IN THE PACKAGE LEAFLET AS A SIDE EFFECT. he told me i was depressed, i reciprocated and told him i am not depressed. Then he told me to take trimipramine, it helps with headaches. I told him I'm not depressed. than i took the medikant and drove home. when i took the first pill in the evening as prescribed, my life ended. everything became unreal, I no longer recognized myself, I immediately had an urge to move and could no longer sleep at all. and even became psychotic. I immediately ran to the neurologist who told me he didn't know about such side effects. I didn't know what was happening to me anymore. everything was unreal and fake. as if I'm dissolving, derealization depersonalization. when i was there he gave me escitalopram/ celexa in addition to trimipramine and opipramol. and I was getting worse and worse I immediately went to a psychiatrist and told him it was these pills. what happened to me he just upped the doses and told me i have an anxiety disorder. I took the cans and no longer recognized my family, I smashed everything and threw things around. the doctors wrecked my life it went on like this for 2 months until my family took me to the psychiatric ward, i told them the pills wrecked me without a second of sleep or sitting still. with full anxiety anxiety fear and panic 24/7. they told me there that we could get it. they stopped taking all the medication and gave me serequel and aktivan. but nothing got better nothing at all. everything had gotten worse. I deeply despise the doctors who did this to me. I was in psychiatry for 2 months and then I ran away with the drugs atosil, effexor/venlafaxin 225mg Tavor 2.5 mg, zopiclone, Remeron pregabalin/lyrica 600mg I just wanted to die. I am infinitely destroyed. my head is burning and tingling spasms have a severe memory disorder derealization nightmares hallucination fear fear fear fear insomnia i am so dizzy and have akathasia to the point of no more. Now I can say I'm depressed but it's not me that it is. It's funny what's going on in my head. I've had 7-10 seizures a day on the meds. and no one dropped them, i kept getting more. when I then I came to a neurological hospital as an emergency. put me immediately pregabalin/lyrica remeron 30mg atosil 60mg. and in the end they only released me with aktivan and effexor/venlafaxin. The fact is that I am now 1 year without venlafaxine and zopiclone 5 months. I'm at zero but nothing improves at all. I cry every day every damn day I hate every minute. And forget everything I did or said 1 minute ago. I come from Germany. and unfortunately I have no more money because I paid all the doctors here with money who have ridden me into the abyss. i really need help i beg you endlessly. I have three children and am married. please please please answer me at least i beg you. help help help.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Brain damage,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16fbh4t/brain_damage/

Just took it once yesterday 2 sprays. 200 mcg each. The first spray actually seemed to help a bit. Then like 3 hrs later I took another spray but this seems to have made me feel worse. I felt more anhedonic, blunted and even nauseous. 

Its been 3 days now and its only gotten better slightly. Still feeling horrible and worried about going back to baseline.

Is this a side effect and does it resolve soon?",False,t5_4aoxhu,NA selank worsening emotional blunting/anhedonia?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16ebgrc/na_selank_worsening_emotional_bluntinganhedonia/
