-> since both acting on NMDA and glutamate, is Agmantine capable of decreasing lamictal's effects of avoiding depressive episodes?

Also, I thought about taking it during the evening so it doesn't affect Modafinil + Concerta during the day.

-> is this a good strategy?

My treatment also includes 400 of lithium carbonate that's being replaced by lamotrigine. Occasionnant taking or cycling with RC stimulants, but less and less everyday.
