yungtemple,"Imo limited creativity in the “nootropics” space from only what ive tried but Kanna, Cannabis, maybe noopept. LSD/shrooms MD since ig that’s considered a noot is the best. Maybe some racetams ive yet to try. Bromantane can also increase creativity but i think creativity is mostly derived from the “soul” or individual.

Upset_Scientist3994,"Intresting, as I am looking for creativity enhancing substances for project demanding long-term abstract thinking coupled with absorption of great data masses and making analytical conclusions out of it via abstract form of thinking (foreing policy). Conventional noots keeps brain humming, but dont really elevate into that level well enough. So with limited monetary resources I am eyeing into peptides, but due of high prices of those kind of things one has to choose carefully if dealing with limited cash. Semax Selank gets its ordinary praise around reddit, but Pinealon what is mayby even more interesting in medicinal sense is almost never spoken about. How would you describe its effect on this field compared into those more conventional choice of peptides and regular nootropics? How was your personal experience about it. I may have access soon via this project partner friends who visit Russia frequently and back so they can bring some over-the-counter gems of their pharmaceutical research. But system in their pharmas how they makke sure best peptide quality is bit challenging for the customer so I must choose some spesific thing and not make unlimited wish list when relying for goodwill of third parties.",1695202357,k1e6x7e,t3_16md1nu,t1_k1akmmr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Ethanol withdrawals can cause tremendous stages of creativity as neural system gets pushed into edge thru multiple pathways simultaneusly with all sorts of endo-hallusinogens and quinolines heavier than any microdosing flooding your system whilst NMDA gets seriously active. Also religious experiences may occur - and that seems to be only working route for those stuck into this this sort of neurohackerism to fully exit  from it when they grow age. Regardless highly favoured by artists in creative professions traditionally and mayby most popular choice in world, not recommended as getting yourself into that stage is too time-consuming and afterwards recovery demanding, from doing the thing you are actually supposed to create. By the way if anyone has more data about what pathway certain isoquinoline endohallusinogen actually does what chronic ethanol consumption upregulates and how wide-reaching cascade (and potential epigenetic mechanisms with long lasting effects) actually does and how it works I could be intrested as I am wondering my own experiences out of that.",1695200511,k1e4k7w,t3_16md1nu,t1_k1dswcd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
