 Currently using Agmatine to help taper klonopin ,
1mg now at 0.250mcg. 
Agmatine has helped greatly as have had minimal anxiety during taper .
I plan on running Agmatine after taper for one month for PAWS and to keep glutamate in check .
After one month I plan on using cerebrolysin for one month course .
Also using two sprays bromantane each morning during taper for
Dopamine support and na semaxz 

Question is , when I run cerebrolysin, will I need to stop other nootropics such as bromantane and agmatine ?

\[By 'not interested in focus, concentration...', I mean that I am not focusing on these things, so if the nootropics you suggest don't improve these, it's fine, and if they improve these, then great. (I wanted to see more suggestions, ig by being not clear I decreased the possible suggestions)\]

I know one ingredient won't be enough, so suggest a stack, or if you only know for one of the things, suggest for that. Just the important thing is that I plan to take them on regularly.

I think I will be taking it in the mornings, or twice a day, to have it's effects throughout the day.

&#x200B;

So I have spent a while searching Reddit and other forums for the answer to this. Many individuals say that they enjoy the combination. The thing is, I saw /u/sirsadalot say that *Bromantane blocks the effects of Phenibut* on a thread. I attempted to message him but he's a busy man and I imagine he didn't see it.

&#x200B;

My personal experience is that I have noticed that it does seem to reduce the euphoric effects of Phenibut. I still feel the anxiolytic effects of it, but not the euphoria.

I tried snorting 25mg each nostril and the a pump of nasal spray nasax. And I smelt the bromantane smell and I felt it very similar to the EC spray. I have an empty sprayer from ec and I put vegan Mct in it and it mists pretty damn good. My question is can I spray vegan Mct oil after the powered or is this something that after time will be a problem.

I assume it’s ok as I’ve seen people make home made sprays with it just being overly cautious. I’ve been told ten grams of bromantane worth X amount of Mct oil will be similar to the EC spray. I don’t wanna use it all in one go and mess something by up which I’m sure I will lol.

I am able to do so only after taking methylphenidate or atomoxetine. The problem with those substance is that their benefit last only for about five hours.
