Hxmusa,"Yes exactly. Dulls the euphoria and “disinhibition” but does keep the anxiolysis. 

Fuck phenibut though in general. It does help anxiety a tonne but it’s not a long term solution. It keep you reliant on it and deludes you in a way where you think you’ll always need it for certain situations eventually.

Take a couple days off from the phenibut or taper off (however dependant you are) and I recommend Bromantane spray in HIGH doses (8-10 sprays).

It’ll remind you of your old friend phenibut ;)",1695148139,k1b3vlh,t3_16mx8kv,t3_16mx8kv,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
c_ckmuncher,"For me it reduces the euphoria from phenibut whilst the drowsiness from higher dosages remains the same. 

It is a shame if youre using phenibut recreationally, but hey your everyday life gets better instead. Pregabalin seems to be pretty unaffected tho *wink wink*",1695146556,k1azcub,t3_16mx8kv,t3_16mx8kv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"Man, you’re so right. I’ve done this before too where I use phenibut for way too long. The point where it doesn’t help at all or do anything but negative side effects. 

I’m going to taper off now. I typically do a rapid take because I lack the discipine for a slow taper. I typically just want be be done with it, plus honestly people exaggerate or are way too sensitive to the withdrawal symptoms in my opinion. It may be though because I’ve gone through opioid withdrawal many times. 

I was using 10-15 grams a day of phenibut, 2-3 grams a day of F-Phenibut (sometimes both at the same time). Baclofen doesn’t work well for me. I feel weird on Baclofen. I tapered very rapidly from those doses (using phenibut for 4.5 months), and it was not bad at all. Used Baclofen for 1 day then stopped.",1695150541,k1barp3,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1b3vlh,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,So the “down” effect people claim happen after bigger doses of bromantane you compare to a certain extent phenibut? Interesting I have been experimenting with larger doses how tired does it make you personally?,1695155035,k1bnq9z,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1b3vlh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
spushkin1,"Glad it wasn’t just me that experienced that! 

I absolutely love pregabalin. I’ve been using phenibut and gabapentin because I had access to a ton, but now I think pregabalin is calling me :)",1695146693,k1azqrx,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1azcub,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"I feel you man.

I’ve been through your situation and have been dependant on phenibut and I completely agree with what you say about the withdrawals. They’re blown way out of proportion on the quitting phenibut subreddit.

If you have Agmatine and NAC, it’ll be an absolute breeze. Agmatine twice a day at 1g and NAC twice a day at 600mg

I recommend doing a taper, then using both of those as glutamate modulating tools as your glutamate will be FUCKED after that. This should help with PAWS. This should then put you into homeostasis.

Then phenibut replacements in order similarity can be:

Flmodafinil+Guanfacine, 
Flmodafinil or any non damaging stim on its own if you’re not prone to GAD, 
Bromantane high dose, 
Kava, 
Kanna.

Hxmusa,"For me personally, it gives me a huge boost in motivation, reduction in anxiety, increase in talkativeness and a general sense of well being. There’s also this euphoric feeling in my chest, especially when I’ve spiked my noradrenaline by getting in a cold shower or gone for a run etc.

Bromantane does that for me anyway but it’s just way more pronounced.

I know what you mean by the “down” effect though. I’m guessing you mean sedation?

This only happens when I’ve not had enough protein in my diet, not had caffeine or just sat in one place for a while.

To counteract this, a cup or two of coffee will do.",1695155526,k1bp5he,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1bnq9z,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"Thank you brother, I forgot about NAC and agmatine. I used both in my taper. Thanks for the refresh!

adamcegan,"Gotcha, thanks. How does that intranasal dose equate to sublingual w/ the powder? For me a high dose is closer to 150-200mg…

I’m interested in learning why everybody here seems to prefer the intranasal spray… Is it superior bioavailability that makes it a better value? Convenience? Both? 

I’ve tried both & the powder sublingually seems to work better for me & I also find it more convenient. It seems like I might be the only one that feels this way.",1695156302,k1brd0w,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1bhkwn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"I’m going to try this maybe today I snorted 50mg powder 25mg each side the 2 mists in the left and one in the right. I will add a few more and see how I feel . I definitely get enough protein and stuff into my diet so I think I’ll go for this!! 

Edit did 4 more sprays so I’ll check in later

Ok so I’m relaxed to the max. Like I don’t think I would care of my gas station I work at got robbed lol. I am kinda tired so I just took 209mg caffeine so and I should eat something also.

It’s similar to phenibut you are correct though

Edit ok so. This is nice but I think I like my four sprays in the am and then sometimes two sprays at lunch

It also seems to have zapped all motivation to any physical activities but I’m mentally aware and I want to sit and read lol",1695215213,k1etee6,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1bp5he,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,"Yeah for me sublingually I do notice effects but they’re quite weak whereas intranasally it gives me strong pronounced effects and within a shorter onset time as well.

Hxmusa,"I personally like TAK at 2mg. It helps me put puzzle pieces together if there is something I was thinking about for a while and trying to figure out. It gives me a very pronounced effect. 

However, if I use it 2 or 3 days in a row, I overthink on it a lot and get completely stuck on a thought without ever moving off of it. 

So I use it only when I completely need to if I have to learn something or just generally whenever I want to.

Tbh when I was dependant on phenibut, I did not notice any effects on it because my glutamate was out of whack. Maybe that is the case for you?",1695154080,k1bkyoo,t3_16mx8kv,t1_k1bjyjm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

It’s nice to discuss this with someone who seems experienced with nootropics/peptide. I feel like half this subreddit is full of people who know absolutely nothing or just read a couple studies and act like subject matter experts.
