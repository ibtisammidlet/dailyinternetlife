Efik_Pail,"Hello,
I won't be very original, I think:

-about herbs: Rhodiola and/or good quality Ginseng are good for motivation and fatigue. Not overly powerful, but definitely not a placebo

-you may try this combo: 4-DMA 7'8-DhF (semi synthetic compound, sold by Nootropics Depot) stacked with Polygala...but 7'8-DHF has quite few studies...it works well for mood and motivation, but safety is not proven.

-Alcar is a good supp for energy (indirectly dopaminergic if I'm not mistaken)

-Agmatine is good for mood and even against light depression

-Bromantane, again. That thing works, I was even surprised that it just works so well : it increases motivation and decreases anxiety. It's a safe compound. Not available in my country but I order it from Everychem. Even with the shipping fees, prices remain very reasonable.

I think the most powerful and safe stack would be Alcar + Bromantane. (+ Agmatine? it won't hurt)",1695206518,k1ecm5d,t3_16n0lmp,t3_16n0lmp,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Kratom checks a lot of those boxes.
Maeng Da strains specifically I would say.

I’d say to do plenty of research if you did as there is side effects. And if you want to take it daily you will become dependent on it. 

For me I outweighed the pros and cons and it was worth it for me to take Kratom daily and be dependent.

You can also cycle through adaptogens . Some will work better than others. Rhodiola , ginseng, etc.

Bromantanes a good one that is a true nootropic.

roco-j,"Alcar is worth trying being so cheap, but personally it actually puts me in a bad mood.

Bromantane I think I need a break because I've used so much in the last month that I don't know anymore what it felt like before. It works someway, but it's subtle. I accidentally increased a lot my coffee habit since I started taking it, so I don't know how much should actually be addressed to that. I definitely have more energy and motivation, sometimes coming randomly. Still, I don't ""crave"" Bromantane like I would do with coffee, for example, so I guess it's really not addictive. Gonna take a couple weeks break and see what happens.

Agmatine I still cannot tell if it has to be taken regularly before feeling its effects. Maybe it's even more subtle than Bromantane but I'm positive there may be something going on. Started taking about two weeks ago, I have more random cheerful moments, but again, nothing so far has a constant effect that really impacts my daily life.

I would say that the assumption of these supplements increases the *probability* of me being in a good and motivated mood, lasting anywhere from a couple minutes to several hours.

My nr.1 supplement anyway:

Sleep.

Efik_Pail,"I think it depends of what we call Nootropic.

If you consider that any substance which maintains the brain in optimal shape as a nootropic, I would say ""yes"", taking some useful vitamins, some amino-acids i tend to lack and maybe an adaptogen I react well with.
For example, I take Spirulina, Magnesium, a bit of Fish Oil and Ginseng or Rhodiola every day. 

It's very hard to draw a line between ""brain enhancing"" and ""maintaining the brain in a healthy state""

But I'll take more specific Nootropics (focus oriented, or stimulating ones) only when I need them, for  example for periods when I have to work for more than 8 hours a day on complex tasks or when I need a little boost on very specific tasks.",1695214181,k1er317,t3_16n0lmp,t1_k1ef73d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

LaoBen,"Pretty much same, I use kratom low doses in a fonctional way, for work, for focus, motivation, energy. And I know it's an opioid dependency.

I also take vitamins, minerals, antioxydants and adaptogens.

I recently adopted agmatine sulfate (from EC), as I feel it's lowering my kratom tolerance and it's enhancing the effects (more sustainable boost for longer period of time if I take a morning dose of agmatine with my morning kratom). And I feel a nice antidepressant effects that counteract the stimulants crashes.

I take bromantane one or twice a week, to help stabilize my dopaminergic system.

I also take maca daily and tongkat ali regularly to counteract the anti-testosteron effect of kratom.

I recently needed an extra boost for lots of continuous days of hard work. So I tried fladrafinil (easiest afinil available in my country) 200mg in the morning, as lower doses wasn't enough. And I would say the boost of alertness is significant and long lasting. I'm gonna see if the effects decrease with several days of use.",1695198266,k1e1rek,t3_16n0lmp,t1_k1cy9en,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
