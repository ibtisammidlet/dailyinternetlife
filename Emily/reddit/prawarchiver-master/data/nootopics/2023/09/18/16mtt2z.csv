Sispants,"I guess my question would be whether the oil actually adds any benefit from an absorption standpoint. I’ll let others chime in but I think the oil is simply a carrier used for ease of administering it.

Personally I’d just snort it and not worry about adding oil after, unless you find your nose gets irritated without it.",1695744127,k2ascus,t3_16mtt2z,t3_16mtt2z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"I just thought since it’s not water soluble and this why oil is used EC spray I’ve actually noticed it’s helped with how irrated my nasal passages were at home I’m allergic to something not sure what but. I also spray the oil first now and then 75~mg divided for each nostril it has been quite effective.

Edit thank you for responding.",1695751577,k2bdnxo,t3_16mtt2z,t1_k2ascus,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sispants,"No problem! Yes, I think you’re correct - the oil carrier is because it doesn’t dissolve (or just dissolves poorly) in water. Glad to hear it’s helping with irritation and spray + snort has been working for you.

How many times a day do you take it? That 75mg is once per day?",1695764175,k2ce45x,t3_16mtt2z,t1_k2bdnxo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Usually with a booster dose ~25-75mg depending on the day a lot of days I forget but lol it seems to help. I used vegan Mct oil can’t think of the brand. But it’s super thin.,1695764466,k2cex1v,t3_16mtt2z,t1_k2ce45x,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
