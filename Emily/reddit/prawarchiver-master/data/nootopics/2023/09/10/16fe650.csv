mikorbu,"Could be the dilemma of B1 (and it’s derivatives) inducing magnesium deficiencies and vice-versa by slapping eachother out of cells if either is/was deficient (or if you’ve taken magnesium for a long time without b1). I personally was only able to tolerate B1 without dips in mood and energy when I started to pair it with magnesium, and suddenly both worked as advertised.

I would opt for taking either ND’s Sucrosomial Magnesium (or Jigsaw’s B-Free SR Magnesium) over citrate since they are absorbed better (especially if you have low stomach acid), won’t be chelated/compete with other minerals, and make it deeper into the body and brain. 

The Jigsaw one is slow release so you don’t feel dulled using it during the day, and it’s chelated to malate which also improved energy. With the sucrosomial magnesium I just pour out 1/4th of the capsule to take with a Methylated B-Complex, and take the rest at night.",1694572508,k0cp9kj,t3_16fe650,t3_16fe650,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
