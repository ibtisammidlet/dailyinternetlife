neuro__atypical,"you want pure dopamine? 3-brmodafinil is a modafinil analog that's about as clean of a DRI as it gets - the effect on NE really is virtually zero. people on the discord actually dislike it because of how pure dopamine it is, but it's probably perfect for you. tak-653 has no tolerance by the way (its mechanism isn't capable of having tolerance or withdrawal), something else might be going on there.",1693772015,jyzvg5d,t3_1694p70,t3_1694p70,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

caffeinehell,"I actually tested Parnate and Nardil, albeit briefly, recently. Mentioned in the post but the Parnate has the stim like effect which results in blunting. That I only tried for 2 days and couldnâ€™t tolerate the increased blunting. 

While Nardil I just tried and actually day 1-2 massively helped but then its serotonergic side effects like no morning wood and no libido along with more blunting kicked in on day 3-4 and now at a week feel worse. I also got bad bloating from it. 

It seems like my symptoms just get worse with MAOIs due to both the stim and serotonergic sensitivities. I need something just GABAergic or just dopaminergic. Something like Zuranolone is basically what I am waiting for but hoping I can somehow manage until then.",1693782418,jz0mxee,t3_1694p70,t1_jz0lres,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

caffeinehell,"I didnt wait that long as implied above because the side effects involved worsening in the symptoms that I am trying to treat, and I didnâ€™t want to risk a crash. Like with Parnate I tried just 2 days and the stimulant robotic feeling was really bad and still took like 3 days after to resolve. Nardil I took for 1 week which as I said first 2 days was great I thought it was working right away but then its own blunting from what I think was serotonin (due to losing morning wood and 0ing my already low libido as well) happened. 

So basically emotional blunting worsened in diff ways on both (parnate immediately, nardil over a few days after initial massive improvement).
