insaneinthecrane,"Phenylpiracetam  paired with a choline source (eggs or alpha gpc is my fave).  Don’t expect it to feel quite like amphetamine but it is definitely the most amphetamine like in my experience. Some people don’t get any effect from it and usually the most common side effect is a mild headache (which is usually either a sign of too little or sometimes actually too much choline). It can cause mild anxiety or jitters in some but probably won’t be worse than that from amphetamine but everyone’s reaction will be different.  I also would take days off and ideally not take it every day just fyi. 

If that doesn’t work, I also really enjoy the combo of aniracetam and oxiracetam (also with a choline source). Aniracetam is a slight mood boost and anxiolytics for me and oxiracetam is slightly stimulating. The combo feels sorta like an ultra smooth and subtle boost of motivation and energy for me. Again mileage may vary

Edit: people are saying pramiracetam. I actually do think this can potentially help quite a bit for focus though I forgot about it as it tends to make me feel a bit “flat” emotionally (not quite depressed but a little meh) which is the opposite of how the other racetams and amphetamines make me feel but again your reaction could be different",1693593103,jypaoqo,t3_167eo1s,t3_167eo1s,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Tiny_E_NYC,Noopept works like that for my research subject. And you only need a teeny tiny amount. Totally cost effective.,1693671727,jytqhur,t3_167eo1s,t3_167eo1s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
hikkitor,Yeah it’s gotta be Phenylpiracetam if you want similar euphoria to adderall. Pramiracetam would be more of the racetam version of modafinil. Strong focus but not really enjoyable.,1693711804,jywfpw4,t3_167eo1s,t1_jypaoqo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
