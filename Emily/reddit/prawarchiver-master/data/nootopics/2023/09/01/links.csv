Initally used to taper Lyrica , now been using it 2g per day for benzo klonopin taper and also for nerve pain. 
i
t’s helped considerably , down from 1mg k to 0.250 mcg. 

Question is , will Agmatine have a withdrawal once I stop it’s use , and should it keep running it for a month or so after I stop the benzo to prevent glutamate rebound ? 

Thanks",False,t5_4aoxhu,Agmatine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1694yfe/agmatine/

All stimulants or stim-like things trigger more horrid emotional blunting for me unfortuately. This even includes things like Parnate where right away on the first day just 5 mg I got the more motivation, libido but a terrible robotic increased blunting feeling. Felt like Ritalin, which also blunts me horribly.

Recently also have tried Nardil at a very low dose 3.75 and 7.5 mg. The first 2 days of 3.75 mg my symptoms were relieved, I felt the GABA effect and the entire world was brighter, was smiling more and I thought this was it. Then as a few days passed I started feeling more blunted, lost morning wood, zeroedd my already low libido, etc from what I think was serotonergic sides.

Even the supplement DLPA I could not tolerate, because it was very stimulating and blunted me more for a few days. However, Tyrosine and Mucuna Pruriens I can tolerate and they help slightly.

Interestingly, Bromantane also subtly slightly helps but isn't enough. It (along with TAK) is actually the only 'stimulant' that I react well to. I've tried the peptide MIF-1 multiple cycles and that was probably the most amazing thing for anhedonia but the problem is its a 5 day cycle and the effects don't really last.

I already do exercise like 20 mins of cardio a day. Does not help my anhedonia/blunting symptoms. These symptoms are incredibly resistant.

Pregabalin 200 mg helps, but builds tolerance and after using it  every few days I started getting bad rebounds so I limit it even more now.

AlloP drops and Etifoxine worked amazing the first 1-2 days and then just didn't work.

TAK-653 (the AMPA PAM) worked amazing the first time, then didn't do too much, then randomly worked amazing again and then didn't do too much. It seems like anything that helps I develop extremely rapid tolerance. I'm starting to wonder if I have some underlying horrible metabolic/inflammatory dysregulation that leads to this.

It sucks that I get more blunted on stims or serotonergic stuff, as this represents basically the only classes of medications we have. I cannot risk SSRI/SNRI either and something like Wellbutrin is very risky for me given my severe stimulant blunting sensitivity.",False,t5_4aoxhu,What to do for anhedonia that gets worse with stimulants or serotonergics?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1694p70/what_to_do_for_anhedonia_that_gets_worse_with/
