Efik_Pail,"Hello!
I only know Bromantane in this list. I think it's one of the best noot I know for quality of life. It's a mild but efficient psychostimulant and it's very efficient, if taken daily, against anxiety.
It won't stop panic attacks (not its purpose) but it will help to stay alert, motivated and calm.
What's good with Bromantane is that  you don't build tolerance and that its benefits last during some days or even some weeks after you stop taking it.

Nebo: I don't know.

Pramiracetam: never tried this one (I mostly use Piracetam and Phenylpiracetam) but I am quite curious about it...

Carnosic Acid: something I plan to try! It seems good for anxiety and seems to be best taken in the evening.


May I ask you what is your situation and what you want to improve using Noots? Relief from anxiety? Curing depression? Improving focus? Improving alertness?",1696080433,k2uzlm8,t3_16vm5xn,t3_16vm5xn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"Bromantane is a mild stimulant, so it may help you to start your day a bit more awake and motivated (or help you later in the day if you have to work a long time)
In the meantime, it acts against anxiety. It won't feel like a Benzos (which crushes your memory and your will to do things): on the contrary, it's an ""everything is ok"" feeling, very pleasant in social situations, it should absolutely not make slow and sluggish like many anti-anxiety compounds do...


It's not a crazy effect, it increases Dopamine (in a very specific way, not in a brutal way like amphetamines), so you feel calm, alert and probably more combative when you take it.
It pairs well with Alcar.


PS: On the long run, it seems to raise Testosterone slightly.",1696092823,k2vu10s,t3_16vm5xn,t1_k2vs8iq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
