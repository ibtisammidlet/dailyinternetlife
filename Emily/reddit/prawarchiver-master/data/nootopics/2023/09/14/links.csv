Generally, more focus when studying and a better capacity to organize my thoughts and choose my words as I'm speaking.  Neither of these is really a problem for me normally, I just notice the improvements when I'm using this.  My problem is that I feel like I've used all my fuel after a few hours.  I'm not normally hungry or sleepy during the day, after some heavy thinking on RGPU-95 I am famished, and I need a power nap.  

Are there vitamins or other supplements I could take to help with the extra fuel this extra processing power is using up?  Or is something else going on?  I just feel like more mental work  = more fuel cost, and being hungry and sleepy seems to back that up.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Energy drain from RGPU-95,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16j0j3v/energy_drain_from_rgpu95/

I think it's due to the doses I've been taking- I've been taking 160mg twice a day. I weigh 210 lbs so I usually need higher doses of noots. I take 300mg of phenylpiracetam, for example, and that's a moderate dose for me. 

I'm hoping the high doses are the culprit. I'm benefiting so much from bromantane emotionally and cognitively but I can't function physically.

It wasn't like this for the first week and I was taking the high doses. Maybe it's built up in my system?

I'm taking it sublingual, holding under my tongue for an hour. Yesterday as soon as I put the 2nd dose under my tongue, I almost lost consciousness. I had to spit it out. 

For some reason drinking water helped with the vertigo. 

The reason I'm posting is no one has ever mentioned this side effect before. 

My plan is to take a week off and then start with something like 30mg 2x daily.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Vertigo and dizziness with bromantane?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16ihtuz/vertigo_and_dizziness_with_bromantane/
