Friedrich_Ux,"You are taking way too much, its anticholinergic and high doses can cause the side effects you described. 35mg sublingually suspended in oil or 18 mg (two sprays) of the nasal spray are enough.",1694710210,k0knm0f,t3_16ihtuz,t3_16ihtuz,12,False,t5_4aoxhu

Black_Cat_Fujita,"I weigh about the same but can only tolerate about 100 mg of bromantane and 200 mg of phenylpiracetam- spread out through the day. 

Bromantane will build up in your system with continuous use. I want to say the half life is 10-12 hours. I would set up a spreadsheet with a decay formula to set up a dosing schedule (but I am a supplement geek). You could also just skip a solid 2 days per week to let it clear your system.",1694711663,k0krswv,t3_16ihtuz,t3_16ihtuz,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

StrikingCheesecake69,"For me, 3 consecutive days of 1 intranasal dose per day (5-10mg) worked great.  I was feeling a ton of extra dopamine for the following days and my depression was completely crushed for a month.  The effects seem to be cumulative.  Sounds like you might just be way over doing it",1694701294,k0jyngv,t3_16ihtuz,t3_16ihtuz,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
