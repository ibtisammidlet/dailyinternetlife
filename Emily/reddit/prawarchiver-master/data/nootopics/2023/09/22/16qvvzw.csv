antimantium,I have some doubts that the effects you're looking for are caused by dopamine.,1695630193,k23zhl5,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
StrikingCheesecake69,"I was under the impression it increases both TH enzymes as well as the L-Dopa to Dopamine enzyme.  So if you didnt respond to L-dopa you may respond to bromantane?

It worked wonders for me.",1695596028,k227jix,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Klaus__Schwab,"Your post history reads like someone with severe health anxiety.

You will find far greater felief addressing that than obsessing over thinking your dopamine receptors aren't working",1695642194,k24g8wh,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Fancy-Category,"Yes, Bromantane can help. It is very mild though. I’ve used Bromantane on and off. It’s very adaptogenic.",1695560322,k1zisf1,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Oopsimapanda,"I'm also super sensitive to THC and respond positively to even small amounts. 

My suspicions recently are that it is less to do with dopamine and much more to do with Choline levels, as I've generally responded pretty negatively to any other nootropic that's increased dopamine. 

The first time I tried an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor it felt exactly like i was high without the negative effects. 

I suggest you try a choline supplement like Alpha GPC if you haven't already before you mess more with your dopamine.",1698376965,k6mv08m,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
WasteFishing830,"Fucks what receptors long term? I'm not aware of studies showing it to be neurotoxic. Sure, it's not the healthiest thing in the world on many other levels, but many people do use it for medicinal purposes. In fact, its been legal to use it in that manner in the U.K (with a prescription) for a number of years now. You are condemning the THC, despite it being the magic bullet, and you are searching for other options that may (or may not) be anywhere close to what THC does for you.",1703788042,kfarx0z,t3_16qvvzw,t3_16qvvzw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

lovejackdaniels,"Thats interesting because in normal life I would be the least anxious person I know. I do get anxiety on weed because so many self introspecting thoughts come to my mind. In normal life, I have rarely any self-introspecting thoughts which is what is leading me to believe its dopamine related. So, no anxiety. Health is one concern definitely. I am trying to fix or atleast alleviate my symptoms.",1695643616,k24ixb2,t3_16qvvzw,t1_k24g8wh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

lovejackdaniels,"Interesting theory. But choline doesn’t do anything for me :(. Have tried alpha GPC from a reputable vendor. Even eggs have choline. Doesn’t do anything for me. Strangely, I am a non responder to nearly all nootropics. But one good puff of weed smoke and I experience things which I suspect normal people experience in day to day life.

Random thought - How’s your memory?",1698495245,k6t6hgr,t3_16qvvzw,t1_k6mv08m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Fancy-Category,"Primarily via improving TH is how it would improve dopamine. L-dopa non response I don’t think is a good gauge to compare how you would respond to  Bromantane. The TH pathway to dopamine is more natural for the body. So, if you don’t have Parkinson’s, or similar diseases, it’s going to work. Only other issue you may face is dopamine receptor down regulation, and you may need to reduce external dopaminergic stimuli temporarily to improve your dopaminergic system.",1695567483,k1zzwnc,t3_16qvvzw,t1_k1zz3o8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fancy-Category,"9-ME-BC is probably the most pronounced dopaminergic compound I’ve used. It is very noticeable. Energy and focus on it is great. One can use it to repair or improve upon their dopaminergic system.

Oopsimapanda,"Ah well was worth a shot. My memory is fine, but oddly I do better when it's worse like when I'm high, as my focus on the present moment goes out of this world. 

You might have to go down the long expensive path of testing (like most people) to find what works for you!",1698499121,k6teavd,t3_16qvvzw,t1_k6t6hgr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
