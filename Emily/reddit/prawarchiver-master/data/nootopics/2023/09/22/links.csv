But cant use THC as a daily driver as it fucks your receptors in longer term. Methyphenidate doesnt work for me and amphetamines are banned in my country. L-dopa supplements dont work. So, will bromantane help in such a scenario? 

AFAIK, bromantane upregulates TH enzyme which helps in coverting tyrosine to L-dopa. But, if I am a non-responder to L-dopa, can bromantane help at all?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Hel. I have a dopamine release problem. Will Bromantane help if L-dopa doesn't work?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16qvvzw/hel_i_have_a_dopamine_release_problem_will/
