e59e59,"You could probably drop the piracetam as TAK is a far superior AMPA PAM. (and did you notice any benefit from such low and infrequent dosing?) I also recall TAK being anti cognitive if taken in too low of a dose, you can search about that here and find out what the minimum amount is.",1694596169,k0dqr7f,t3_16hbvu7,t3_16hbvu7,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

l0cknessmonsta,"For piracetam? Oh absolutely. With piracetam I cannot take it so frequently because it starts to make me depressed. I forgot to put I also take cognizen as a choline source but recently found out that it actually doesn’t contain as much choline as other choline supplements. 

That 1 800mg gives me enough motivation to accomplish task and to do things without dreading them. Usually last until 4-5pm if taken in the morning at 8am. 

Interesting. I did some googling and found some threads on Reddit that most people recommend 1mg - 2mg of tak653. Anymore and if becomes to stimulating and anxiety inducing. Tbh, my main goal is to see if it can act as a good social lubricant.",1694606348,k0e6b2u,t3_16hbvu7,t1_k0dqr7f,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
l0cknessmonsta,"I honestly can’t remember but some of the supps I’ve had for quite awhile so it’s not like I’m having to replenish every month. The most expensive thing in my stack is the NMN. 

I initially wasn’t sure if I should keep taking NMN but I ran out of it today and had noticeable fatigue and brain fog. 

Currently looking to either buy more NMN from a reputable source or try the cheaper alternative NR.",1694657554,k0hvcoe,t3_16hbvu7,t1_k0hun5l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
e59e59,"Sounds like you're definitely an abnormally high responder to piracetam in that case, makes me wonder if it would translate to a strong response to tak as well. I alternate it with piracetam, for cost effectiveness, taking one the first day and the other the next etc. Works well for me. You could try that and start at 1mg, assess effects, and titrate up until you find your ideal spot.


Edit: I only mentioned stopping piracetam because I assumed it wouldn't be very potent with your dosing regimen, but if you get such a prominent effect it's definitely something to keep.",1694607130,k0e7v60,t3_16hbvu7,t1_k0e6b2u,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"How is nmn? I'm considering it, and others, because I got the most unimaginable dip in cognition currently

l0cknessmonsta,"Okay gotcha, thank you. It’s 7:19am here in Texas. Should I take the tak653 with my morning stack on an empty stomach? 

I suppose I am a high responder. I’ve experimented with the 1600mg piracetam and alpha gpc in the past. There was one day where I felt absolutely incredible. Not only did my verbal fluidity go up but I actually wanted to talk to people and felt so eager to accomplish my job. However towards the end of the night I would get severe headaches no matter how much alpha gpc I took. I never quite figured out the dose for that combination so that’s why I just dialed it back to 800mg piracetam every 2-3 days. I also notice a slight rebound whenever taking piracetam or phenylpiracetam. I don’t feel as motivated the next day when I don’t take it.",1694607587,k0e8sdx,t3_16hbvu7,t1_k0e7v60,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
e59e59,"I'd say go for it if you don't have something very important going on today, there's always a risk of an unpredictable response trying something new.

l0cknessmonsta,"Hmmm I’m a real estate photographer so while work is really slow, I do still need to drive quite a bit today. My first shoot I’ll be meeting up with an agent but my 2nd/last shoot is just an empty lot that’s a good 1hr 15 minute drive. 

Also forgot to mention I just recently started taking kana yesterday. I’m in the phase of “priming” thought I’d mention that before taking tak as well",1694608051,k0e9qzw,t3_16hbvu7,t1_k0e98z4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
