mrmczebra,You need a good scale to measure amounts that tiny. Beware of cheap scales claiming to be accurate to the milligram. Most are not. I recommend the Gemini 20. It's about 50 bucks.,1694885930,k0v4kqr,t3_16kby1e,t3_16kby1e,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
Comfortable-Roll4347,"Scoops are like eyeballing, it is not reliable especially being unfamiliar with a substance and what amount/weight may translate visually.

Scale recommended. For example - $20 for a jewelry scale that can measure 10g down to 0.000 - to safely and accurately measure whatever is being worked with. Ebay, Amazon, and even some nootropics vendors will have scales that make this process straightforward and informed every time.",1694884794,k0v1i1f,t3_16kby1e,t3_16kby1e,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Totum_Dependeat,"If you need super precise dosing, like down to the milligram, use volumetric dosing or buy premixed liquid or pills. Otherwise, get a milligram scale. 

If you spend about $50 you should be good for anything that does not have a steep dose response curve. I recommend the AWS Gemini-20. It's accurate within about 3mg (+/-).

Don't forget to set the scale to the appropriate unit (grams) and always use the scale's tare function to weigh the capsules first.

Get a micro spatula for putting powder into the capsules. For capsule sizes, 00s and 000s both work well. A micro spatula should fit into either of those. No need for a funnel. I prefer 000s since some powders - like racetams - are really bulky.

Hope it helps.",1695000720,k12gs9t,t3_16kby1e,t3_16kby1e,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
