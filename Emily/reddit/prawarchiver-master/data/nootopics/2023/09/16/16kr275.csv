hikkitor,"Sabroxyâ€™s feedback seems mixed. Seems like a hit or miss supplement. For me personally it was a huge disappointment. I even got up to 5-6 pills as I had the regular strength version but ND later introduced an extra strength version that was 5x as strong .

Brandis_Black1994,"I don't want to encourage you, or impact you're decision too much, so I figured I would look into it a bit more, and it's possible this person is correct, however I wouldn't take something that hasn't been efficiently studies such as this one with a chlorine atom. However, I did find this, You may have to copy and paste. I personally would pass, and stick with the more researched chemicals. Too each there own though.

PA99, I am not a professional scientist, but I will tell you that I, myself, would never knowingly take a chemical with chlorine molecule in it, unless it was natural .. now I know Wikipedia is not the best reference or source of information, however it has been cleaned up quite a bit since the old days. With a quick stroll through [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine) . It seems MOST synthetic chemicals with Chlorine associated with it, are super dangerous/toxic/carcinogenic. After reading this page I would never take a un-natural substance (knowingly, unless it was tested sufficiently such as medications (even then I would be super skeptical. It seems in the form of  chloride anion is necessary for life, however most people who have a decent diet and health has plenty of Chloride anion. I wouldn't want to press my luck though, To each there own, but I personally believe you should trust you're initial instinct.",1695002675,k12l5mi,t3_16kr275,t1_k10rezh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

hikkitor,"Powder was probably a decent idea though. The pills were pretty hard to take down even though they were small. 

Since you have the bulk powder- has upping the doses past the reccomended dose been successful at all?

I want to like sabroxy as the science seems to support it.

full disclosure: my expectations were likely too high as I was coming off adderall",1695173817,k1cw9gz,t3_16kr275,t1_k1763pv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
