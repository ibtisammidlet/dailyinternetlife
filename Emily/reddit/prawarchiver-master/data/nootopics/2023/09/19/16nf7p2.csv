Friedrich_Ux,"The selegiline is more liable to cause irritability/aggression. May just be the combo, never had aggression from Bromantane.",1695229042,k1fueey,t3_16nf7p2,t3_16nf7p2,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,So increased dopamine synthesis + MAOI? Seems reasonable you might have some unwanted side effects,1695258819,k1i3lel,t3_16nf7p2,t3_16nf7p2,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
callStackNerd,"If I dose Bromantane for more than three days in a row I start feeling overly stimulated which leads me into being more aggressive / over confident.

I still love bromantane but I use it a little more sparingly now.",1695219856,k1f4udc,t3_16nf7p2,t3_16nf7p2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

DomingoElToro,I get more aggressive with bromantane and I only use it every few days or so. But it's noticeable.,1695247676,k1hcdv1,t3_16nf7p2,t3_16nf7p2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Dopamine, I've also had that some periods when I took bromantane or other dopamine upregulators, but not always. So it's dependend on environmental factors",1697188736,k4om8tn,t3_16nf7p2,t3_16nf7p2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"You are more right here. Dopamine is associated with overstimulation and aggressiveness with some people, but your nervous system sweeps it out whenever there is excess of it. Just plain increasing it like Bromantane does is not dangerous as such unless there is some problem with metabolism of it, and of course Selegeline main function is to interfere with that metabolism as MAO-B inihibitor. Also impact of that may remain with you with very long time. So I would pick Selegiline in this combo as main culprit and thing to remove first when there is dopamine overload issue. Same thing with SSRI-meds, serotonin production as such is no bad no matter how high volume it is, but problem comes when it cannot be swept away when it goes too much and that is the spot what makes SSRI-meds so much problematic in remotely same kind of way like Selegiline is here.",1695566526,k1zxewh,t3_16nf7p2,t1_k1fueey,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
