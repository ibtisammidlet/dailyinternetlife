McDaddy089,"So I did a whole cycle last year lost quite a bit of weight I jumped back into teso like 4 days ago now. I upped my dosage and day 1 I was hearing shit I felt like crap and just felt like death. Day 2 I started seeing shit, day 3 I started getting sleep paralysis and now I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy. Iâ€™m waking up on day 4 with little to no sleep and I have no idea what to do. Anyone else have this problem, I legit feel like a crazy person.",1695315912,k1l7jtx,t3_16nhxr2,t3_16nhxr2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Dear_Manufacturer_69,I have this product. It tastes like death.  Are we supposed to Injest dmso? From what i read itâ€™s a topical solvent and i have injested it - not sure if i should have. I emailed the company to see because I am confused by how weâ€™re supposed to use this product.,1695300935,k1k2zrk,t3_16nhxr2,t3_16nhxr2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Punishers_endofdays,What else are you taking that might be increasing dopamine or serotonin? You might be experiencing SEROTONIN SYNDROME. Do not take this lightly...look it up and see if your symptoms fit.  I'd drop the teso until you figure it out.,1695320351,k1lk0l6,t3_16nhxr2,t1_k1l7jtx,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Punishers_endofdays,"DMSO is a phenomenal solvent that big pharm does not want you to know about. You were ok injecting  it. From my studies for health many take 1-2 teaspoons per day so your dropper amount is totally fine and probably made it work better plus helped other issues. I'm curious what they tell you.  

Oh, to get beyond your esophagus and get the DMSO down further fill a empty gel cap then swallow it.  You can get 1000s of empty gel caps for a few bucks on line.",1695302883,k1k7ljd,t3_16nhxr2,t1_k1k2zrk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Curious, what dosing are you using .25, .5 daily...I haven't met anyone else going higher or even needing too. The .25 from Limitless for me was completely enough.
