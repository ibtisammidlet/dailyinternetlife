Even though it is pricey your getting 1mg as opposed to .5mg at pure rawz, .25 at Limitless, .5 at Swiss chem...It is in liquid form with DMSO. I am a huge believer in DMSO.  I've never had an issue with umbrella and to be honest they remind me of pure rawz.

 Currently using Agmatine to help taper klonopin ,
1mg now at 0.250mcg. 
Agmatine has helped greatly as have had minimal anxiety during taper .
I plan on running Agmatine after taper for one month for PAWS and to keep glutamate in check .
After one month I plan on using cerebrolysin for one month course .
Also using two sprays bromantane each morning during taper for
Dopamine support and na semaxz 

Question is , when I run cerebrolysin, will I need to stop other nootropics such as bromantane and agmatine ?
