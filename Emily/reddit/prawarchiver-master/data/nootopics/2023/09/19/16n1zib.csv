Tiny_E_NYC,"Do you mind sharing your whole schedule with this? It would be very helpful. I am taking Agamatine & on .25-.50 Klonopin and want to get off it. I took an Agmatine last night & it kept me up until 5:30am. I‚Äôd love to know your dosing schedule (for the Cerebrolysin too) if you‚Äôd be so kind. Or even a DM of it, would be greatly appreciated. Good luck üçÄ & thank you in advance",1695188759,k1dovbz,t3_16n1zib,t3_16n1zib,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
