Tbh, when I first took Tak-653 I wasn't sure about the correct dose and took less than 1mg. Didn't feel anything(benefits) until I started taking 2mg. I have to say that my experience with this stuff has been positive. It doesn't give you quite the same eagerness as Piracetam or Phenylpiractam. It also doesn't give any kind of stimulated sensation. What I do get is the ability to stay calm and think slower. It's excellent at reducing anxiety.

My main reason for trying Tak-653 was to see if it could help with my verbal fluency and I can confidently say now that it does. It's not quite the same as phenibut but it allows me to find words and be able to express my thoughts easier while still maintaining a filter. With phenibut I would talk non-stop without caring what comes out of my mouth... Also wanted to note that it does nothing for irritation. Traffic and shitty drivers still piss me off.

I think that's all I wanted to share. I'll report back if I experience any side effects. So far nothing out of the ordinary.

:edit:

Oops, I forgot to mention this. The first 3 times I tried Tak-653, I had this strong desire to just listen to music and daydream. It was incredible how hard it enhanced my MDD. Not sure what happened but that seems to have somewhat gone away. I kind of feel like Tak-653 works better if you're out instead of being alone.

Few questions:

\- Do I need to take a choline source like piracetam?

\- Should I cycle off this stuff every once in awhile or is it safe to take every day?

\- Any other supplements that synergizes with Tak-653 to enhance verbal fluency?

\- What's the shelf life? Thinking about buying a few more bottles just to store it incase these become scarce.
