lord_weasel,"Interesting. It did nothing for me at any dose. I tried  500ug all the way up to 4mg. It made me irritable one time, but every other time I didnâ€™t notice any effects. I felt more from neboglamine, which is supposedly the lesser of the two.",1695835713,k2gj0ku,t3_16t7w7b,t3_16t7w7b,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

l0cknessmonsta,"interesting indeed. I guess it's true that not everyone reacts the same to certain chemicals/drugs. 

I never even heard of neboglamine but i'l look into that as well. thank you for chiming in.",1696086046,k2vcjxk,t3_16t7w7b,t1_k2gj0ku,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
l0cknessmonsta,"Okay good, I'll just save the choline on days where I take piracetam/phenylpiracetam. I'm curious to hear about the cycling if you have any additional information. Like the cycling routines in order to keep tolerance from building. I'd hate to lose the benefits or have to take more. 

&#x200B;

I can't speak for aniracetam but if it's anything like Piracetam or Phenylpiracetam it's a different kind of verbal fluency. Like I mentioned, Tak-653 doesn't really give you any kind of stimulation or eagerness to want to talk to people. I find that phenylpiracetam, I am in a much more uplifted mood and feel happy. Being in that state always makes you more socialable. However, with Tak-653, I don't feel feel as happy but more of content. I can still enjoy having conversations with people and I don't have as much fear approaching them either. Hope that makes sense

Sorry, can't help you there. I'm way out of college and I was always dumb with math/physics. I can't say if i'm able to pick up concepts any easier but I am learning about finance.

l0cknessmonsta,"Sorry, for the late reply. I don't always get on this throwaway account.

I can sleep just fine on it. Never had any issues with it but I do take it first thing in the morning. Usually before 12pm. Though tbh, I have not taken it at all recently only because I still get some mild depression from it. 

&#x200B;

That is strange though and a crappy side effect. I haven't read of anyone else having any sleeping issues. I'm usually the type of person that's very sensitive to drugs too. I'm also taking only .5mg and never more than that. I'm sorry but I don't have any solution to your problem but I would make a separate thread asking about it.

Phenibut is weird. I've been taking it for almost 3 years now. Never abused it but even taking it at my moderate doses and limiting it to max twice a week. I'm starting to notice bruxism. Not to mention, phenibut just doesn't hit the same for me anymore. I suspect all the recent batches are not the same substance as before despite passing lab tests. There was an interesting post someone made in the phenibut subreddit that there are different types of Phenibut, so testing for purity only doesn't give you the entire picture of what you're getting.",1704647408,kgr3vf0,t3_16t7w7b,t1_kgi0ei4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

l0cknessmonsta,I donâ€™t unfortunately. I feel like at the most itâ€™ll last 2 days after taking it. After that I hardly notice any effect,1705086980,khk5fdf,t3_16t7w7b,t1_kh31pqb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
