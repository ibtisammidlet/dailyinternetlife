The only “drug” I usually consume is caffeine. I also take some basics like Magnesium, D3, Glycine, etc. every day. I also exercise vigorously daily.

I usually have some mild gyno ever since I hit puberty. I have no clue why, but it’s always been harmless besides the slight puffiness ess. It doesn’t itch or anything like that. I also have noticed though that I appear to hold some extra water weight. All of these signs suggest elevated estrogen.

I’ve always enjoyed some nicotine here and there recreationally. I love cigars. I’ll have one maybe every month or so. However, a few weeks ago I decided to pick up some 2mg lozenges  to see how that’d affect me “nootropic” wise after reading some posts on it.

I’ve just been popping one every morning after I get to work, and I noticed that after the first day my gyno seemed to disappear almost entirely! I also noticed that although I felt hungrier and started eating a bit more, I seem to look more defined as well, like some extra fluff  (water weight?) dropped off my body. Premature ejaculation also improves noticeable. Nothing crazy but still there. 

I don’t know if this has to do with the dopamine release triggered by the nACh receptors agonism but it very well could be. I’ve also seen studies showing that Nicotine is an AI in the brain: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904480/
Nothing else I’ve ever tried has done anything like this. 

The slight gyno seems to come back after a day or two of not having any nicotine and the body fluffiness also comes back. Something also worth noting is that the Nicotine doesn’t feel addicting whatsoever. Sure it’s a nice little buzz for a little bit, but I have no hard time at all not hinking about taking more throughout the day. Also, during the periods where I didn’t take any to test this effect I had an easy time just going about my day as usual.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Nicotine massively reduces my gyno and body “puffiness”,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16c75yo/nicotine_massively_reduces_my_gyno_and_body/
