expanding_crystal,"Sounds like you’re figuring it out, but if you’re having gyno and other issues, your body is producing too much estrogen/estriadol/prolactin. This is a common problem for bodybuilders who get into performance enhancing drugs, especially people who are “super aromatizers” or whose body converts testosterone into estrogen at a higher rate. 

There are many ways to curve off this problem, from supplements like methyl folate, to more serious ones like aromasin which reduces/stops testosterone from turning into estrogen. 

You need to be careful with those because you can “crash” your estrogen, which is bad- you need some estrogen to function normally so you need to find a level that reduces but doesn’t stop it.",1694088910,jzinu5r,t3_16c75yo,t3_16c75yo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

MezDez,"

It has a lot of components.

Poor posture can entrap nerve communication down the spine , leading to more nervous output to maintain nerve conduction homeostasis. E.g some forms of scoliosis can lead to it.

Also, a weak pelvic floor along with a weak trunk. This one is more important.

Serotonin calms the spinal column hence it reduces conduction and prolongs.

Works very well. I made an injectable one so it works within 5 min.
