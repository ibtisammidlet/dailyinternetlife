D2_Agonist_Master,Bpc induced anhedonia can be tricky because I remember someone made a video on it looking at a study that it actually reversed dopamine-blockade ill effects. I don’t know much else about the mechanism behind it though.,1694298419,jzvkksk,t3_16e6643,t3_16e6643,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

It only allows you brain produce more dopamine which converts to norepinephrine which can cause insomnia.",1694278735,jzu4m32,t3_16e6643,t3_16e6643,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Klaus__Schwab,"It's pretty obvious you have health anxiety.

Worrying about your dopamine receptors when you've had no proof to suggest you have brain damage isn't a normal behaviour.

Worrying about all of these different nootropics is going to give you more stress than finding one to fix a supposed drug induced anhedonia",1694292946,jzv6ixk,t3_16e6643,t1_jzu6oe9,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

e59e59,">Bromantane’s mechanism is thought to be like that of Amantadine’s: Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition [4]. Similarity is shared not only in downstream effects, but chemical structure.


>High dopamine biasedly enforces synaptogenesis in D1-containing direct medium spiny neurons, and this creates an imbalance with D2-containing indirect medium spiny neurons. Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition, however, corrects this, therefore improving disorders such as dyskinesia, psychosis and other detriments caused by abnormally high dopamine.


>The anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds indirectly inhibit histone deacetylases, and this gives rise to neurotrophins such as BDNF and especially GDNF. As seen in Parkinson’s patients, GDNF injections had benefits lasting up to 3 years after stopping, maybe explaining Bromantane’s dopaminergic effect which lasts for 2 months after discontinuation. Reduced neuroinflammation and increased neurotrophins also functions as a dual protective measure against neurotoxicity in dopamine neurons.",1694284675,jzukjwl,t3_16e6643,t1_jzuk1gg,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
