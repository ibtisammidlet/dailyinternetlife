ConsequenceLatter978,I would take the bromantane on my off days since I feel that the bromantane will take the zest the amphetamine. But that’s just my personal opinion,1694231739,jzrsib1,t3_16dr8l1,t3_16dr8l1,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
hikkitor,I honestly did it a lot when I had easy access too both a while ago. I loved it. But it did kind raise my expectations or baseline could be a better term. I would recommend doing them sparingly . It is awesome but it’s probably not sustainable or healthy and a tolerance will be built . But I do think they complimented each other excellent .,1694234440,jzry1y4,t3_16dr8l1,t3_16dr8l1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
,I’ve been coupling one spray of bromantane in the morning with my twice a day adderall for the past two days. I feel the lethargy of the bromantane supersedes the energetic effects of adderall.,1694266187,jzt989v,t3_16dr8l1,t3_16dr8l1,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DueWillingness6954,I’ve mixed them before for a couple of weeks.  However I got no response from Bromantane.  Just my experience.,1694274099,jztsdco,t3_16dr8l1,t3_16dr8l1,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sispants,"Not dangerous together. I take both daily. Adderall for ADHD and Bromantane + L-tyrosine to offset a dip in my dopamine production from prolonged 5-HTP use for anxiety.

I’ve noticed if I do 75mg-100mg of Bromantane with Addy I get squirrelly, but at ~50mg it feels like it balances out the Adderall nicely.",1694284739,jzukq5j,t3_16dr8l1,t3_16dr8l1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sispants,"Yeah, have ordered 3 bottles from them so far. Can also vouch for the powder from UmbrellaLabs as that’s what I’m currently using",1694377877,k00kse1,t3_16dr8l1,t1_jzzuzpo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sispants,"Can you expand on that?

I take it as an alternative to an SSRI for both depression and anxiety. It’s also prescribed in Europe for the former. Most of the depression is managed by a mood stabilizer prescribed off-label, but it was never effective with the anxiety component.

I was on an SSRI (Lexapro) for 2+ years for the anxiety piece. It worked, but eventually the sexual side effects became too annoying so I looked for an alternative to increase my baseline serotonin levels. 

I’m confident 5-HTP was effective at that because as I stepped down my dose of Lexapro while slowly increasing the 5-HTP dose (extended release) I had basically zero withdrawal symptoms and I was completely off Lexapro within two weeks. 

Yes, different method of actions but similar end result of having an increased amount of active serotonin in my body. Prior to all that, if I had missed even one dose of the Lexapro the withdrawal symptoms were in full swing. 

Regarding the negative effects on my dopamine levels, I attribute a lot of that to the dosage of 5-HTP I was using - 300mg per day. Nowadays I only take 100mg.

Obviously most of that is anecdotal and just my experience. But if you say it’s a mistake then I think you should explain why. Feel free to throw some science at me too.",1694533181,k09qmz7,t3_16dr8l1,t1_jzy08r3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Valentine21469,I just purchased some of the powder. How do you administer it? Do you make a solution? I'm not sure how to dose it if I dilute it in water to make a solution.,1696431384,k3fproi,t3_16dr8l1,t1_k00kse1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
disheveledfiend,">Yes, different method of actions but similar end result of having an increased amount of active serotonin in my body. 

this statement is debatable, at best. SSRIs are known to exert their antidepressant effects through down regulation of 5-HTP receptors. Not to say the increase in serotonin levels doesn't contribute to the antidepressant effects, its just not the main factor in how SSRIs work, contrary to popular belief. 

and you know, if 5-HTP works well enough as an antidepressant for you to notice, I would consider that a definite win because if you can spare yourself from taking SSRIs or other psychotropics, you are doing yourself a favor.",1703102711,ke846vw,t3_16dr8l1,t1_k09qmz7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sispants,"It won’t dissolve in water. I’ll need to defer to others as to how to make an oil-based nasal solution

You can put it under your tongue and it will dissolve/absorb (very slowly). But I’m not sure of bioavailability vs nasal. If you are comfortable snorting it, you can also rip it straight up your nose. I don’t find it to be particularly irritating on the nasal passage.",1696431523,k3fq58n,t3_16dr8l1,t1_k3fproi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
