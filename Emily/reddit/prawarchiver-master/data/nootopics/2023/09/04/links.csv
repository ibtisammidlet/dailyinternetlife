Since it's been often cited as a good supplement to fight anhedonia and depression, I decided to give Agmatine a try and ordered it from everychem.

The other day, I had 1g in the morning with breakfast and 1g at lunch.

Honestly, the only noticeable effect was having neverending stinky farts. Felt no noticeable improvement on mood whatsoever.

Should I try a smaller or greater dose? Should I keep taking it regularly to notice its effects? Does it mean that maybe I don't respond to it at all?

Also, I wanted to ask -- does Agmatine disturb sleep quality if taken in the afternoon?

Thanks in advance.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Should Agmatine be taken regularly to feel antidepressive / uplifting effects? Does it affect sleep if taken in the afternoon?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/169t4u3/should_agmatine_be_taken_regularly_to_feel/
