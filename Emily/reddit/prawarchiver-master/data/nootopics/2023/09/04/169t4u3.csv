Jeannnnnnnnnn,"It worked for me mid/long term. Similarly I couldn't point it out at first but my life improved a lot 'coincidentally' after a while. But after an even longer while I got extreme itch, which might have been from Agmatine, so I stopped.

Now I'm severely depressed so I'm risking it again",1693848503,jz4cab6,t3_169t4u3,t3_169t4u3,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
FawkesYeah,"Don't take it with a meal, take it 30 minutes before a meal. Agmatine competes with protein, so you need to take it before eating. That might explain why you didn't notice much mental effects from it.",1693887286,jz6v35g,t3_169t4u3,t3_169t4u3,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
millmount_,Do you think daily intake of agmatine could cause rebound of increase glutamate release since it blocks/reduce activity on the nmnda receptors?,1693851555,jz4ken4,t3_169t4u3,t3_169t4u3,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
millmount_,"According to examine agmatine shouldn't be taken with protein because of low bioavailability 

""Agmatine is not absorbed well when taken with dietary protein, because it uses the same transporters as arginine. Further research is needed to determine if oral agmatine supplementation provides the same benefits as were observed in animal studies.""",1693866130,jz5lfb5,t3_169t4u3,t3_169t4u3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Yeah this basically goes for all supplementary amino-acids, always take them on emtpy-stomach, else all the other amino-acids that come from the breakdown of the protein in your meal start competing with your supplemented amino for uptake through the same transporters in the gut (and BBB).  


Best to wait 2-3h after last meal and wait 45m after taking a supplementary amino-acid before eating again.",1693884652,jz6qbiz,t3_169t4u3,t1_jz5lfb5,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Jeannnnnnnnnn,"It's extremely subtly in that only immediate effect I noticed was morning wood. But when looking at it from a distance, how it affected my behavior, it was quite major.

Jeannnnnnnnnn,"Yeah in the past I might've had particular things to vent about but now it's just empty. 

Yes, I took 1 g morning 1 g afternoon. Nothing really seemed to help of all kind of supplements, shortly after starting the Agmatine routine things got better. Could've been coinsidense, as time heals wounds, but I'd be willing to bet on that coinsidense again",1693849489,jz4ey64,t3_169t4u3,t1_jz4czot,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
