Punishers_endofdays,"Definitely do the NA semax...I have used it twice (nasal) the first time was amazing honestly I was blown away. The second bottle I tried either was too soon and I needed to take a break from it (which from what I've researched shouldn't have happened) or more than likely I got a bad bottle. 

From what I've read the bromantane should be killer to use for focus? 

Have you tried noopept? I'm prob spelling that wrong. Also trying that in an nasal inhaler but I do have to say the focus is fast. It isn't ""energy"" just sharp focus and can be used intermittently...as in ""as needed""... If you dose it with a cup or two of coffee it amplifies the ""energy"" of caffeine.

Have you tried tesofensine? I got a lot from that but dam it is expensive. Nice thing about that is its an oral dosing.

On deck for me is NA selank.  Probably in a month or two.",1695720268,k29dpwb,t3_16s0kpg,t3_16s0kpg,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
