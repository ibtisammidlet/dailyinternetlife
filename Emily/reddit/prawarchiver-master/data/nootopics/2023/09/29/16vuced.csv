Efik_Pail,"Hello,
There are many good stacks for focus. The other reditters already gave very good ideas.

Here is what works for me
(Some context: i am a 35 years guy, in good shape, no health problem. Never taken drugs. high IQ on some aspects, average in others. I have a past of light depression.I teach French in high School  in France and write some papers for university. I work about 45 hours a week. But I suffer from chronic asthenia and some demotivation because of Beta Thalassemia Minor, that's why i am naturally attracted toward mild stimulants)



-basic stack for focusing: Noopept with a bit of Choline. 
It is dirt cheap and helps for focus and memory. You'll have to re dose after about 4 hours.

-Tak-653 has a different way of action (very selective Ampa-Pam) but it feels quite similar, for me. Smooth but efficient, more than Noopept. It's the one you won't feel at all but it may be the one who gives you the most benefits.

Those two are not compounds that you will ""feel"", they just work in the background.

-when I am tired or sleepy, Phenylpiracetam+ Choline is undoubtedly powerful: it's a Racetam, so no big surprise on the effects, but it may be the most powerful: it is stimulating, helps concentration, keeps you awake, makes you feel confident but it will reduce appetite, and some people feel maniac or aggressive on PhenylP. (My wife reacted badly to it). Use it only one or two times a week if you want it to remain stimulating. If you don't care of the stimulation, it can be taken for longer periods.

-Obviously, there is Modafinil and other -afinil. Most of them require to be prescribed. It works well, very well with repetitive tasks and simple logical thinking (maybe not some good on complex problem solving). It keeps you awake, alert and motivated. For me, it's a very pleasant feeling...but on very  complex tasks, I think that something like TAK is more efficient (but less noticeable). But Modafinil is clearly a good work-horse when you wake up at 5.30AM and that you'll have to work until 9PM.


-Bromantane is something I could take every day, I think. Good against asthenia, it reduces anxiety without making you groggy, you just feel clear minded, calm and more confident on low doses of Bromantane. When you have to teach to students, it's a godsend!


-my hit-or-miss: Semax...I still don't know if I like Semax and Na-Semax, or not...sometimes, it will greatly helps for focusing on complex tasks, sometimes I'll just feel more tired that before taking it. It's not logical, I know, and I still don't understand that paradoxical reaction (maybe it rises BDNF too high for me, which can leads to brain fog?). If fact, I feel that during 2 or 3 days, Semax is detrimental for my focus. It seems to benefit me after some days, and for one week or two after I stop it. (Some people report the same with things like Cerebrolysin, for example)


-quite experimental: 4-DMA 7'8-Dhf....had good results with it, paired with Polygala (to avoid potential TrkB downregulation). It helps for mood and focusing. It has a very long half life, so take it early. It has some potential if you respond well to it. But its safety is not proven.",1696071683,k2uk2l6,t3_16vuced,t3_16vuced,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
LuminalBeing,"I can't speak for many other substances, but sublingual PRL-8-53 HCL was a game changer for me.

Hopefully others chime in, I'm interested in trying out new things as well.",1696061587,k2u65wq,t3_16vuced,t3_16vuced,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"Ay least for me:
Sunifiram (0.1 MG, it releases Ach in the PFC)+Donepezil (5 MG)+Soy lecithin (the only Ach precursor that works for me, Alpha GPC feels ""weird"" on my body, since it Is related to TMAO I prefer to use sporadically)+IDRA-21 (3 - 5 MG, just a tinny dose). An stimulant since I have ADHD.

However the game changer here is Sunifiram. I can take Methylphenidate, Donepezil and IDRA-21 and I feel enhanced but not In the ""enhanced ready for learning on a study session"" mode.

I have also mixed Sunifiram (0.1 MG) and PRL-8-53 and the effect Is impressive. However it Is only suitable for short sessions of memorization, PRL-8-53 enhances memory but reduces processing Speed, so you become slower at finishing tasks.
That could be counteracted with IDRA-21 but I don't want to cross the line of taking too Many drugs at the same time.
Of all of these IDRA-21 Is the safer and most researched. At least it Is very similar to Diazoxide AND have a higher number of studies, even in monkeys compared to PRL and Sunifiram. All points to IDRA-21 having a good safety profile, devoid of organ damage and mutagenic properties (obviously Taken at low doses, +10 MG a day could be too much, so always take magnesium and lithium orotate to prevent excess neuronal firing).

If Sunifiram could have a better safety profile I would use it frequently since it Is one of the most powerful noots I have taken.",1696823562,k434yk2,t3_16vuced,t3_16vuced,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"Hello, based on my experience it should not be problematic.

A low dose of Modafinil will make you alert and Noopept should enhance focus. I don't see negative interactions in theory but I have no qualification in chemistry, contrary to many people on this sub.

Modafinil makes you feel wired, it can give a sort of tunnel vision when you try to solve problems. Some people say it hinders creativity. On the contrary, for someone (like me) who tends to think about too many things at the same time, it is a good thing.

But 30mg of Noopept may be a bit high, I use 10mg in oral form (I plan to try the nasal form sold by EveryChem). 10mg is enough for most people (it is the standard dose for Russian pharma-grade Noopept)

Reminder: please note that Modafinil (and my favourite, Armodafinil, which last longer and is more progressive) is a prescription med in most countries. It's easy to buy on the Internet but should be legally prescribed by a doctor. Sorry to be ""this guy"" but I've been banned from the big Nootropics sub, just for -mentioning- a website selling Modafinil among other (completely legal) things.",1696081223,k2v19ly,t3_16vuced,t1_k2uvgns,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

TigerEye408,"Definitely can vouch for a stack I did, Tak-653, but DEFINITELY, PRL-8-53 and Noopept mixed and taken with a choline source CDP-Choline or eat 3-4 hard boiled eggs. Definitely I got my assembly work done, and a learning class for DAW (music production logic/Ableton program classes). Phone wasn’t a distraction either. 
Has worked several times. PRL doses vary. Got my stuff from Everychem.com they have it available in Dropper form. When I ran out of Noopept, I had powder form to go sublingual. But the dropper liquid from EveryChem was much more effective. 
Try the Trifecta. Also 4-5 days in to Piracetam with PRL and Noopept was super effective as well. 
TAK and piracetam as I cycle those. Both are effective. I felt that Tak-653/Tropisetron/CDP-Choline alone made me a bit more sharper for learning in general.",1696067810,k2uem7j,t3_16vuced,t1_k2u8mw9,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

I have experience with Tak-653 buti'm curious to try this PRL and nopept next. Are any of these substances hard on the liver? Liver health is something i'm really concerned about and is the reason I quit drinking alchohol for over 5 years now.",1696085910,k2vc7v6,t3_16vuced,t1_k2uem7j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
