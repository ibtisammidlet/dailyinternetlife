Reason I ask this is because I already take bromantane to upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase levels, and it may be beneficial to add in lithium for an even bigger increase in TH levels. But if they use the same mechanism to increase TH, then it would be pointless taking both as thrtd just compete with each other.

Regarding lithium, this study says “Chronic (but not subacute) lithium treatment resulted in significant increases in TH levels in rat frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Lithium (1 mM) also increased TH levels in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in vitro, indicating that lithium increases TH levels in both rodent and human tissues” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9523597/",False,t5_4aoxhu,does bromantane & lithium orotate upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase in the same way?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16wgipn/does_bromantane_lithium_orotate_upregulate/

I've been rather interested in homotaurine lately.
However the price differences online are obscene and I wonder what might be behind all this: just as an example: 

[€95 euros for 25mg?] https://absource.de/product/homotaurine/

Or here 

[€19 for 60x100mg capsules]
https://www.supersmart.com/de/boutique/gehirnnahrung/homotaurine-erganzung-0661

Or this

I'd love to get some insight on what some of you are taking to get an edge with learning new skills such as programming, mathematics and whatnot.
