Upset_Scientist3994,"Intellimeds homotaurine 24 euros for 50 grams powder is not that bad. 

But I would be curious to know how much it differs from ordinary taurine which can be so cheap. Would be grateful if you or somebody would answer for that.",1696337296,k39ykbs,t3_16w7xt1,t3_16w7xt1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Valuable_Jellyfish54,"Thanks for the input I'll check it out.

I'm not a chemist, all I know is that homotaurine is like taurine on a molecular level, but with an extra carbon molecule in it's chain. It seems to cross the BBB easily and homotaurine appears to mimic GABA. Homotaurine is tramiprosate which is a precursor to acamprosate (sold under the brand name Campral) which is used to treat alcohol dependence by reducing the neuroexcitability during alcohol withdrawal. Presumably because it acts like alcohol on the GABA system. 
Why an extra carbon in it's chain makes such a difference beats me, clearly it makes enough of a difference for a pharmaceutical company to capitalise on it.",1696338602,k3a1dnr,t3_16w7xt1,t1_k39ykbs,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
