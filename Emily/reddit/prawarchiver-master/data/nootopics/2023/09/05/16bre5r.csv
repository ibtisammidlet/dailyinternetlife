sirsadalot,Idra 21 has been abandoned for compounds with better pharmacokinetics and likely selectivity such as tak 653,1694025171,jzeyzgh,t3_16bre5r,t3_16bre5r,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
e59e59,"PRLs creator had a feud and lawsuit with the university he developed it at. They unplugged a fridge and allegedly ruined some of his samples. Seems like enough circumstances for the compound to be abandoned sadly. It's also a nootropic much more than a medical treatment in terms of effects, which isn't focused on in the west.",1694024890,jzey6n2,t3_16bre5r,t3_16bre5r,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

WishIWasBronze,The Soviet Union developed substances like Phenylpiracetam specifically for their astronauts to enhance cognitive function and deal with space travel.  It's even more disappointing that Russia has abandoned this research.

Jeannnnnnnnnn,"I know it isn't about subjective effects, but from what I could notice IDRA-21 did significantly more to me, only down side is its probable long mode of action.

Tak-653 is not something of which I noticed any difference/impact. But perhaps only comparing results of repeated IQ tests while cycling the 2 compounds (and sober) are valid enough to consider drawing conclusions on their relative impact

From a theoretical pov: Maybe variables in our biological complexities can make tak-653 work less effective than the (cheaper) idra-21 for me specifically, despite what current research might indicate to 'be the best'.

(Or maybe I need a way higher dose of tak-654 than what was recommend, but that would be really expensive for me)",1694123475,jzl4s71,t3_16bre5r,t1_jzezzso,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Their best achievements imo were bromantane and somewhat piracetam although technically the guy who invented it and the concept of nootropics was based in Romania 

Phenylpiracetam is just an a4b2 full agonist which isn't as exciting, but yeah it feels good

It seems like the west and japan are actually coming out with more nootropics but just not purposing them as such. It would be cool if it had adoption at a governmental level but it is what it is",1694026014,jzf1elh,t3_16bre5r,t1_jzf0ll2,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
