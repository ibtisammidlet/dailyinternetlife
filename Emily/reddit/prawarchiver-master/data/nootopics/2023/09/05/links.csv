\- IDRA-21, is an ampakine compound, that has been noted for enhancing learning and memory.

\- PRL-8-53 is a derivative of benzoic acid and phenylmethylamine that has effects on human memory enhancement.

&#x200B;

It's odd that these compounds haven't been studied more extensively. Is it a matter of funding, lack of interest, or are there safety concerns that aren't widely discussed?

&#x200B;

Also there are more compounds than the two I mentioned that had the same thing happen to them.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Does anybody know why the studies of IDRA-21 and PRL-8-53 have been abandoned?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16bre5r/does_anybody_know_why_the_studies_of_idra21_and/

boost dopamine post vyvanse use

improve mood 

And it’s use as an actoprotecter

I’m using the spray at 28mg , but don’t notice much energy boost atm .

also using Agmatine to help benzo taper at 2g per day 

question is , could it be the fact I’m already tapering benzos that I don’t get much stimulation from it and only two months out post vyvanse 

Also could the Agmatine be dulling the feeling ?

Also using 500mg tyrosine before the bromantane .",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane question,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16amahs/bromantane_question/
