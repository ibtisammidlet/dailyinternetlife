Earesth99,"Na-selank was better than selank for me - there was a noticeable energy boost.  With Bromantane, it was more theoretical than observable, st least for me. Ditto for agmatine. 

Kava is a non-addictive, legal anxiolytic (beverage) that  you might try.  If can really help people reduce benzo use. Don‚Äôt bother with the pills on Amazon - you will want to make a traditional drink/shell.  Toss it down before you can taste it.  Search for it on Reddit and you‚Äôll learn all you need to know. 

If should cut your taper in half. 

Good luck.",1693923530,jz8jo77,t3_16amahs,t3_16amahs,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
FawkesYeah,"If you're looking for more dopamine effect, you could add Sabroxy to your stack. It's a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Combined with Bromantane, you might feel more motivation.

With that said, Agmatine is an NMDA antagonist. It is going to give you a blunted feeling where dopamine feels different/off. It's just part of how it works, there isn't a way around it that we currently know of.

I recommend taking Agmatine before bed, at least 4 hours after a meal (because it competes with protein in food). It will do its job overnight. Then in the morning you can take your dopaminergics and they will feel good again.

The key with all of this is to play around with the dosages and timings for yourself. For instance, if you find that Agmatine makes your sleep not as good (it may or may not), then you may want to take it in the afternoon instead. But not in the morning, otherwise again dopamine won't feel as good. Same idea for Bromantane plus Sabroxy, try each one separately, then try them together, then try Bromantane 30 minutes before Sabroxy.

After running some tests like this on yourself, you'll find a system that works for you. Stick with that and you'll find success.",1693937921,jz9nnxn,t3_16amahs,t3_16amahs,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

From what I know there shouldn't be a problem continuing daily, especially if they work well for you. Maybe you could see how you feel with vs without them after the taper is done?

Earesth99,"That was based on flawed research.  Long-term, heavy- drinkers end up weighing less than those who don‚Äôt drink. 

Like alcohol, it is hard on your liver, so it shouldn‚Äôt be combined with alcohol, particularly on a regular basis.
