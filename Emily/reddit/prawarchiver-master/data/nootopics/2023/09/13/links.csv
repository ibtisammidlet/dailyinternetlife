I have been using Lithium Orotate for adhd with exceptional results, now I want to titrate up but don’t want to jump from 5 to 10, I saw that there is a 2.5mg which leads to my question:

Does it matter if I mix brands currently using KAL 5mg and want to mix with 2.5 different brand. Thoughts sorry if you think it’s a silly question.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Titration Lithium Orotate,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/16hgen7/titration_lithium_orotate/
