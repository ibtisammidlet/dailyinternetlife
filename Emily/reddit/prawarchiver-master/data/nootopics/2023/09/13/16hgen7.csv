I'm looking to try it and appreciate any insight or experiences, thanks in advance.",1694602055,k0dys1t,t3_16hgen7,t3_16hgen7,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
redditlass,"does bromantane & lithium orotate upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase in the same way?

 Both lithium and Bromantane are said to upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase. Would they upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase in the same way or different?

 Reason I ask this is because I already take bromantane to upregulate tyrosine hydroxylase levels, and it may be beneficial to add in lithium for an even bigger increase in TH levels. But if they use the same mechanism to increase TH, then it would be pointless taking both as thrtd just compete with each other. 

Regarding lithium, this study says “Chronic (but not subacute) lithium treatment resulted in significant increases in TH levels in rat frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Lithium (1 mM) also increased TH levels in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in vitro, indicating that lithium increases TH levels in both rodent and human tissues” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9523597/",1694605836,k0e5arz,t3_16hgen7,t3_16hgen7,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
Wise-_-Spirit,"This is fine but if you have capsules you can also dissolve your dose in water and then use volumetric dosing to adjust your dosage. Just avoid salt concurrently as it can compete for absorption.

For example, just open up a 5mg capsules and pour it into 500ml of water (a standard water bottle)
Now you can drink 100ml for one mg, or 50mo for a half mg, etc. and spread the desired dose however you want throughout the day",1694617252,k0ew5wn,t3_16hgen7,t3_16hgen7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
bluMidge,"I think you'll be fine as well titrating or actually bumping up straight to  10 mg.
It's a mineral for the one person on here that didn't know that. Me, until researching it further last night.

Has anyone been able to find a paper or information on the half-life of Lithium Orotate?",1694604330,k0e2jlp,t3_16hgen7,t3_16hgen7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MR_BreaDHead,"Ok the easiest way for me to start is to list my adhd issues:

- impulsively 
- binge eating - more chocolate for dopamine 
- intrusive thoughts - all day everyday 
- mood and rage - common in Men 

Now what has changed:

- all of it literally gone 

I am not joking I feel a million dollars thanks to 5mg of lithium Orotate in the morning. I still have some intrusive thoughts that ruminate but that’s ok compared to how my head would spin daily. 

Synergy yes with b12 combined I would have so much energy I would go for a run. 

I wish you luck if you have any of the above, iherb has them for 11.95 btw",1694640072,k0goa33,t3_16hgen7,t1_k0dys1t,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
