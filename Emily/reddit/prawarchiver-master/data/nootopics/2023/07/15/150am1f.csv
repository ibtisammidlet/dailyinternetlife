Moist_Ad9937,"Beta alanine is a taurine transporter inhibitor so without taurine supplementation it can cause issues in basically every organ in the body (since taurine is utilized in all energy processes), namely the eyes (macular degeneration) and brain (neurodegeneration).

I wonder if it can recreate the physiological effects of kidney failure which are partially caused by increased taurine degradation and reduced taurine synthesis. 

Alcar I know nothing about. 

Methylene blue is a potent MAO inhibitor which if you havent done genetic testing, this can be VERY bad for slow catecholamine metabolizers.

This seems like it would be good for endurance training though (provided you use taurine too)…",1689672584,jsflssa,t3_150am1f,t3_150am1f,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,I’ve done methylene blue and noopept and wanted to combine with alcar but did not have it at the time. Alcar should synergize nicely with methylene blue as I believe they both have acetylcholine esterase activity and both affect serotonin and dopamine.,1689445203,js3ebmk,t3_150am1f,t3_150am1f,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Moist_Ad9937,Also methylene blue significantly blocks the conversion of citrulline into nitric oxide. Do with that info what you will.,1689672715,jsflyiy,t3_150am1f,t1_jsflssa,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Moist_Ad9937,"Increased blood pressure through high dopaminergic/adrenergic activity. Potential serotonin syndrome. Neurotoxicity. Since it prevents adrenaline/noradrenaline clearance it puts the body in a constant sympathetic state which is obviously dangerous.

Then you have to avoid foods like cheese that are high in tyramine since even low doses raise the risks I mentioned above^. 

Basically every risk associated with an MAOI. 

Oh and NO antidepressants EVER. That would genuinely hospitalize you.",1689832186,jsp00yw,t3_150am1f,t1_jsozay9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Moist_Ad9937,"Well if erections are based on localized nitric oxide release then one could assume it could worsen ED. Could it cause it? I dunno. 

It works the exact opposite way of viagra and cialis. It inhibits cGMP",1689741165,jsjsobq,t3_150am1f,t1_jsjbj1i,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
