Unfortunately, I'm taking benzodiazepines, but I'm planning to stop them slowly. I would like to know if I can take bromantane without risk and if there are no dangerous interactions?

I'm considering combining methylene blue, ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine), and beta alanine in my daily stack to help with anxiety reduction and improve my focus. However, I'm curious about the potential interactions between these substances.

In the past, I've found methylene blue to be beneficial in reducing stress levels. However, I want to ensure that combining it with ALCAR and beta alanine won't nullify its positive effects or possibly lead to any negative effects.

I would greatly appreciate any insights or experiences you may have with this combination. Has anyone tried a similar stack, or does anyone have knowledge about the potential interactions between these substances? Any scientific studies or anecdotal evidence would be highly valuable.
