Took the whole bottle up my nose.  2 squirts in each nostril.  It did not work for me.  Maybe I’m a non responder.,1689519098,js72dkx,t3_1510h0l,t3_1510h0l,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sajkonaut,"Interesting - im unable to find reference though. Im about to switch from memantine to bromantane - and Im using 150-200mg baclofen daily alongside, to stop alcohol cravings.
Shall they not interfere?
Also by the way - im years into co-usage of daily memantine, high dose cbd, alcohol, benzos, stimulants - and my long term memory, and also attention and cognitive performance is silly - my bet is i shall maintain abstinence, gonna start phenelzine, switch from memantine to bromantane, add tropisterone - anything else comes to mind, which main things could help?
Im also going for microdosing of psylo and lions manes along many other things like ldn, training and so.
I drank and took benzos and stims for years and years and now im afraid how wrecked my brainz may be. Any insight about how to approach glutamate/gaba/thismuchmess healing?

dylan_0001,"Yeah I sort of feel like it gave me those effects too. Not what I expected when it seemed like gods gift to most peoples anecdotal experiences. Was quite the opposite in terms of anxiety and being stimulating. The only thing I can say is you can get more baseline motivation that is really it. No euphoria, lifted mood, any of the usual stuff you would expect from something like that, kind of worthless in my book and I feel like it did take away from the positive mindset I was building beforehand. I feel like I easily reverted back to negative pessimistic outlooks once I started bromantane and am still trying to fix it after stopping usage.

There was a study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540966/) that inspired me to try it - after all, i was drinking so destructivelly and im after so much (from childhood years i was diagnosed with tourette syndrome - no drugs from the biggest caliber did help till i started self medicating with marijuana at 16yo and spiraled into polyaddiction) that i do not hestiate trying such tools.
Overall through my life they and then i had myself through the drug store shelves and substances of all kinds - i used to anyway decide what to medicate me with - now the doc don't even ask why and what anymore, he's too old and he knows it and trust me and my research abilities).
As for WDs - i should, but if i do stop, that means im binge drinking and then im back to baclofen - and im on it maybe third month, raising my dosages - it's not long term yet but it probably will be).",1689518861,js71ubt,t3_1510h0l,t1_js6zp8a,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

I feel like that's some risky grounds im stepping through and Im afraid of what would going cold turkey cause (im cosidering a year off at inpatient rehab but they decline to acknowledge even the names of things im taking, so rather was considering).
Im totally overdoing it with cbd for years (up to few hundred mgs daily sublingually) and feel it's time to drop it so maybe some palmitoylethanolamide gonna take it's place.

Fine-Tale2468,Benzos are the first thing we get patients off of. Slows your processing speed. We can see it on the brain mapping (qEEGs) that we do in real time. It slows down the brain and makes it sleepy. Have you tried DHH-B yet? It is made from Magnolia bark. However do not use Magnolia bark it is not the same. I get pharma grade DHH-B. I recommend it to a lot of our patients on benzos and those with high anxiety. I'm on zero meds now except for levothyroxine (thyroid) and Everychem's Bromantane and TAK-653 and occasionally NA Selank. First time in 25 years I'm not on anti depressants.
