ilovedoxo,"“Methylphenidate has both dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter binding affinity, with the dextromethylphenidate enantiomers displaying a prominent affinity for the norepinephrine transporter.[citation needed] Both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomers displayed receptor affinity for the serotonergic 5HT1A and 5HT2B subtypes, though direct binding to the serotonin transporter was not observed.[101] A later study confirmed the d-threo-methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) binding to the 5HT1A receptor, but no significant activity on the 5HT2B receptor was found.”

CryptoEscape,So is this to say the 5HT2B activity may be (primarily?) responsible for the side effects (or additional benefits) of the Levo-Threo isomer?,1689876935,jsrervt,t3_154wufp,t1_jsrck0r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"I had some mild GI disturbance my first couple weeks on Methylphenidate, then it mostly went away.  

When I switched to DexMethylphenidate it pretty much completely went away, as long as I don’t take it right before a meal (the norepinephrine reroutes blood from your digestive tract to your brain and muscles, essentially reducing digestion.)",1689879730,jsrmaag,t3_154wufp,t1_jsritgl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SurfaceThought,Is it poorly absorbed? I thought the deal was more than it has high first pass metabolism so little made it past gut/liver. Either way blood levels tend to be very low compared to the Dex isomer so the general consensus is that it doesn't do much,1689880684,jsrotym,t3_154wufp,t1_jsritgl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"It does seem to be negligible.

I can’t figure out what it is about the Levo-Threo isomer that makes me feel such a sense of doom.  Yet the Dextro Threo isomer doesn’t",1689878484,jsriy0b,t3_154wufp,t1_jsrhv7x,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
