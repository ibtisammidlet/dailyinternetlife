SunDevil329,">I’ve experimented just to see if there was a phenibut withdrawal

I'm going to assume you've never had to deal with a drug addiction and/or dependency, because if you had I'd sincerely hope you'd recognize what a catastrophically bad idea this is. In many (perhaps even most, depending on the substance) cases, the individual is unaware that they've developed a dependence until they're already in pretty deep.

That said, yes, I suspect you're correct that most individuals that end up dealing with the more serious withdrawal symptoms are taking several grams a day, or at least several times a week.

>That’s like saying kratom is an opioid.

Kratom isn't strictly an opioid, but its metabolites are potent agonists of the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR). It undoubtedly has a significantly larger spectrum of pharmacologic effects than simply opioid agonism, but it definitely produces effects consistent with existing opioid medications.

dylan_0001,"That’s a bold assumption. All it takes is some awareness and once you choose to ignore it or something causes you to not care anymore towards the chance of addiction is when it happens not because the person is so blind in the first place that they didn’t know addiction would happen I mean cmon all of these substances are found through research and whether or not there’s a chance of addiction would come up. A gun doesn’t pull the trigger and make the conscious choice to kill someone a person does. Someone is always making the choice to do something you can’t blame a substance for someone’s lack of awareness/care. All of the information is there and they choose to not respect it or the substance. That mindset is how things get banned and people no longer have freedom of choice due to others being fools.
