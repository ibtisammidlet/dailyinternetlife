Effects.

I read that Dextro-Threo-Methylphenidate is the primary stereo isomer (or is it an enantiomer?) of the Methylphenidate molecule that improves ADHD.

I can’t find much literature on Levo-Threo-Methylphenidate (present in Ritalin/Methylphenidate along with Dextro-Threo Methylphenidate) but it seems like the Levo isomer is less predictable, less specific, and mainly causes side effects.

Yet Ritalin is often first prescribed over Focalin, and more popular …Why?? What Are the benefits to having the Levo-threo isomer?  

Why would some people respond better with the Levo-Threo-Methylphenidate isomer?  

Or is Ritalin/Methylphenidate simply more popular due to brand recognition?

Any research, insights, anecdotes, etc on Levo-Threo-Methylphenidate are appreciated.

Note: I know Methylphenidate’s not technically a nootropic, but hopefully it’s relevant at least from an aspect of studying its neuropharmacology.
