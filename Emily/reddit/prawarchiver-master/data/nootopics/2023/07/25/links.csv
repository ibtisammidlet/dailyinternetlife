> Caffeine synergizes with another coffee component to increase plasma GCSF: linkage to cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's mice

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21422521/

****

Coffee's stimulant and cognitive effects are usually attributed to its caffeine content, while its antioxidant & anti-inflammatory effects are often attributed to the other chemicals in it, which have no known psychoactive effects - like chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, genistein, and trigonelline. However, a paper from 2011 suggests caffeine synergizes with one of those chemicals (or a distinct, unknown chemical) to improve working memory.

The study found treatment of either Alzheimer's-model mice or normal mice with coffee increased plasma GCSF and two immune signaling molecules, IL-6 and IL-10. The increase in GCSF specifically was associated with a working memory improvement in the Alzheimer's mice with coffee. However, caffeine or decaffeinated coffee did not increase GCSF at all, suggesting there is a unique synergism between caffeine and another chemical in coffee producing this unique effect.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) is a signaling molecule which mostly acts on bone marrow to increase the production of multiple cell types - however, it also has neurological effects. GCSF was found to increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure involved in reward and motivation. GCSF increases motivation to work for a food reward in mice, as well as enhancing cognitive flexibility^[[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30150359/) . GCSF also increases the rewarding effects of cocaine by potentiating cocaine-induced dopamine elevations in the nucleus accumbens^[[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34487190/) . In general, it can be said GCSF stimulates the activity of dopamine neurons in brain regions responsible for regulating motivation and reward.

With these points considered, these findings might imply **coffee has a stronger stimulant effect than caffeine alone**, due to the unique synergism causing GCSF elevation, finally leading to increased dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway. Caffeine itself does not increase dopamine release in the striatum by itself^[[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25871974/) , but GCSF elevations induced by coffee *might* increase dopamine release.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Coffee might be more stimulating/motivating than Caffeine alone: Coffee, but not caffeine or decaf coffee, increases GCSF levels.

some people say put the nozzle a little outward, some way in ward. some don't care

then some say tilt your head back, some say forward. some even want you to hang your head upside down at the edge of your bed. 

what is it? how come the makers of this rat testing substance did not education or inform us on treating our pets? 

In my experience, it seems like outward and tilt forward is better. I didn't bother testing outward tilt back yet or normal and title forward to test it, I will. this is just plain wrong.",False,t5_4aoxhu,So who's right about the nasal spray,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/159igvy/so_whos_right_about_the_nasal_spray/
