890-2345,"Ideally you should be maximizing the absorption, so that means the nozzle should be directed opposite the septum and not towards it",1690375463,jtikoj2,t3_159igvy,t3_159igvy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
taktician-653,"The camp that's correct is that the nozzle should be tilted outward.  


W.r.t tilting head back, upside down, etc... Think about the anatomy; the area that you're targeting is on the upper area opposite your septum on each side (as qdouble noted). Tilting one's head back or upside down \*will\* cause the spray to pass this area and thus result in absorption. However, some will go to back of throat & thus be absorbed similarly to an oral ROA. The same goes for upside-down.  


Tilting one's head to the side such that it's horizontal to the ground (when administering to left nostril, tilt head to the left, etc) targets this area more than tilting head back or upside down. Think of this as a more effective variant of the tilt-the-head-backwards approach. Keep your head in this position for 30-60 seconds before administering to the opposite nostril.   


I've wasted an entire bottle of bromantane experimenting with this. The leakage is nil to none and the effects are obvious using this method.",1690549087,jtsqusc,t3_159igvy,t3_159igvy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

qdouble,"I’ve experimented with different techniques…as long as it wasn’t leaking out of my nose, there was not any extreme difference. It might seem like a big difference the first time, but I think it’s may just be placebo…because within a day or two, it feels the same.",1690328789,jtgdqly,t3_159igvy,t1_jtg6y79,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
NootropicLoves,maybe it's just me. sometimes I'm connected sometimes not and maybe depending on how it's congested it might not work well. I'm going to try it now and hopefully get some vivid dreams tonight,1690331686,jtgkfqj,t3_159igvy,t1_jtgdqly,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
