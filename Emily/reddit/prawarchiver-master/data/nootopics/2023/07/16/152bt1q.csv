Icy-Economy4478,"* PS: I’ve also been on and off various prescribed ADHD stimulants in both methylphenidate and amphetamine families over the past 3 years. The methylphenidates exacerbate my depression, and the AMP meds lose efficacy quickly for me. None of them seem to help long term for my fatigue especially, which is to be expected with tolerance (I have tried magnesium for this too)… but they are often prescribed for narcolepsy and other sleep disorders due to daytime sleepiness so they must help to some degree for some people like me. 

I am most interested (from my own research and Reddit reading) so far in noots like Neboglamine, Agmatine, Bromantane, Tropisetron, and tak-653 (but reports for tak helping depression specifically seem mixed so I’m more hesitant).",1689623422,jsd0x3l,t3_152bt1q,t3_152bt1q,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
hammyflams,magnesium + taurine + uv radiation + anaerobic movement + Rhodiola/bacopa.. I liked regular semax a lot although it’s not powerful and consistent like ssri can be (I hate ssris) (I would try NA amidate) which you can combine with Selank. Bromantane is highly regarded. There are stronger things like tianeptine but I’d avoid dependency causing things. Nothing works better than addressing serotonin/dopamine regulation directly tho,1692399604,jwsdeqw,t3_152bt1q,t3_152bt1q,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Icy-Economy4478,"u/sirsadalot I tagged you on my similar thread on the discord as well - would just love your input if you have a moment, especially re: any knowledge of tropisetron (and/or even bromantane) being helpful for chronic fatigue. I found one NIH clinical study with positive results for cfs from it.. but just would like your personal opinion. 
For some extra background on how I respond to certain substances: I respond to SSRIs (Luvox and Prozac) as zombified - while on them 3 years ago, they made me sleep for 17 hrs a day and have minimal thoughts or feelings. Now, I’m off all antidepressants but have had daily daytime fatigue (to a lesser degree) for 2 years now still after stopping the SSRIs.

BigWhat55535,"TAK-653 is definitely mixed on mood. I didn't notice an improvement from it. I personally don't think it will make a significant difference for your conditions, as it is extremely subtle, and it's main effects have to do with cognitive enhancement.

A good number of people see success with Agmatine for mood. I didn't see a difference, but I recommend trying it because it's cheap and side effect free, so may as well.

Bromantane gives me more energy (mostly physical energy), and a hedonistic motivation. So, if you've ever had issues with following dopamine rabbit holes on stimulants, bromantane gives me a bit of that. Also makes me way horny.

I use Tropisetron mainly for anti-nausea. The cognitive effects I get are mainly a feeling of zen calm and focus. Makes me feel like I could keep doing whatever I'm doing. I like it for that reason, as it does improve my focus. Could be anti-anxiety for that reason, but not enough to treat serious anxiety issues.

I don't know much about ANS dysreflexia, but blood pressure seems to be an issue. In that case, I would recommend Guanfacine. Only problem is Guanfacine causes fatigue. Though, for me, that fatigue goes away after about three weeks at any given dose.",1689626377,jsd8nhp,t3_152bt1q,t1_jsd0x3l,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Thx for responding! 
Have you personally tried bromantane or nah? 
Also I was looking into potentially getting semax or selank but then read some reviews on them causing hair loss and I cant risk that side effect cus I’ve already experienced some of that recently naturally..

I wish so badly I could tolerate Rhodiola - I’ve tried various brands / types from Amazon or Etsy small shops, but every time they make me feel spacey and actually a bit more drowsy all day until they wear off - I find that my response to Korean red ginseng is similar to that of Rhodiola as well weirdly (so opposite effects of what they’re said to do for most ppl)",1692403092,jwslc19,t3_152bt1q,t1_jwsdeqw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"I'm hardly as knowledgeable as sirsad on this subject, but anecdotally I've been trying (and mostly failing) to treat chronic fatigue for a while now with limited success.

Bromantane might be helpful, but I wouldn't expect anything dramatic. Tropisetron is decent for anxiety; unlikely it'll do anything for fatigue, though.

Most effective thing I've found is modafinil and analogues. Racetams don't really do anything for me.

Starting to seriously consider trying NSI-189. I've been hesitant to try it thus far, given the unpredictable spectrum of results people seem to get. That said, may be worth a shot at this point...",1689640975,jse6xe6,t3_152bt1q,t1_jsdzg8h,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Icy-Economy4478,"Hey thanks so much for your run down of those substances / thx for the fast reply! 
This is really helpful and much appreciated! 

True, I think agmatine could be more worth trying for me than tak-653 for now for mood. And interesting insight on your experience with Guanfacine

Have you ever taken tropisetron on its own/ did you notice a more stable or positive influence on mood level from that one at all? It sounds helpful for anxiety, which likely contributes to my low moods as well. I guess also depends on if you’ve struggled with low moods or depressive symptoms in general for supplements/substances to noticeably improve mood maybe though :)",1689626862,jsd9xqj,t3_152bt1q,t1_jsd8nhp,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Icy-Economy4478,"I appreciate your reply, it’s valuable to me! 
Yeah, I think the hardest aspect of treating my and many others’ fatigue issues is that the cause is technically unknown. If I could pinpoint the underlying mechanism(s) or deficiencies at play, I could treat myself accordingly - rather than just treating the general symptom of fatigue. But so far, that hasn’t been possible for me. Repeated generalized and specific blood tests, a sleep study (polysomnography and MSLT), and most recently heart monitoring haven’t gotten me the answers I desire.. yet. I’ve also had therapy (ACT, DBT, CBT) and worked on acceptance of my condition. But it’s hard to accept how I feel when I had to quit my fulltime job a couple of months ago because I was so physically fatigued :/ sorry if oversharing, can help to feel heard sometimes and not as alone in our struggles",1689642286,jse9ofl,t3_152bt1q,t1_jse6xe6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

BigWhat55535,"I have struggled with apathy/blunted emotions, but if by low mood you mean negative affect, I don't have any disorder or dysfunction of it. I don't get sad, angry, despaired, or anything else at inappropriate times or for unusually long periods.

For apathy, I can confidently say Tropisetron would be utterly useless. It has no uplifting properties. If you've ever been on a long walk, where your thoughts enter a flow state, Tropisetron is quite like that, but perhaps more subtle depending on the dose.

Maybe that could be useful for managing low mood. I think you can answer that question for yourself better than I can for you.

Personally, NSI-189 has had the best effect on apathy. It increases the intensity and scope of my emotions a lot, which helps me feel more human and better invested in my own life.
