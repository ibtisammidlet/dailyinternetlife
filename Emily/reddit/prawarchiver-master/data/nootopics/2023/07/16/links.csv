I’m a female in my 20s who has struggled with a variety of physical and mental health disorders which have been most prominent in the past 3 years. I have been on 8 pharma antidepressants in all of the usual classes (ssri, snri, ndri, maoi) + 3 add-on anti-psychotics, but no nmda antagonists yet. I want to mention, I don’t like some of the common side effects and anecdotal reports for prescription Auvelity nor Ketamine. 

I have a passion for neuroscience-related research which stemmed from my extreme ocd (which has been basically ‘cured’ by 3 years of exposure response prevention therapy), excessive daytime sleepiness (which was either *anecdotally* caused by or at least exacerbated by SSRIs like Luvox and Prozac - and I also have the lowest level / super mild diagnosed sleep apnea), and depression (could technically be considered ‘treatment resistant’). I also have recently been diagnosed with autonomic nervous system dysreflexia or dysregulation by a cardiologist. 

My question is: what nootropic stack could have the best likelihood of helping with my major challenges (ANS function regulation, EDS / fatigue, low mood / lack of motivation / negative thinking, and high (generalized) anxiety). 
I’m not looking for medical advice - just a basic suggestion for the noots mentioned in this sub :) thank you in advance!!!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Inquiry re: best nootropic stack based on my subjective symptoms list,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/152bt1q/inquiry_re_best_nootropic_stack_based_on_my/

I’m looking for a reliable source for TAK-653 within the EU. Anyone that knows of such seller? My googling came out with practically zero results.
