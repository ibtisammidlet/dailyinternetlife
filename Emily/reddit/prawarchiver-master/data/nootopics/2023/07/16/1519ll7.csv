WrongdoerHonest5943,"I agree. Like I wish it was more of a ""mist"" spray like a traditional allergy nasal spray instead of the more liquid/oil spray that bromantane is.",1689550241,js958sq,t3_1519ll7,t3_1519ll7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fine-Tale2468,"I use it with no problems. I recently recovered from a pretty intense nasal surgery in January and have done fine with it.

One thing that people don't realize is most people do not use nasal sprays properly. I work in a brain specialty clinic, and use a lot of neuro pep nasal sprays. I have a brain injury. 

[Here's a tutorial on nasal sprays ](https://imgur.com/a/bUuW0pK)

Most times people do it the wrong way leaning back instead of leaning forward. Leaning forward is key with chin toward chest. If you look at the diagram you'll see the guy on his knees with head tucked I do the same position but I'm standing. It's pretty easy that way. 

I hold the position for a good couple of minutes just relax let it soak in to the nasal passages and slowly stand up after.",1689557212,js9k0cr,t3_1519ll7,t3_1519ll7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Komputer_One,"One benefit I notice with caprylic acid is that it hydrates the nose well. I have had chronic nasal congestion since I was a kid and it is often times dry. I do feel you however, because of my nasal issues the bromantane spray, and nasal sprays in general, do not work that well for me. I have used nasal sprays throughout my life.",1689615935,jschbfv,t3_1519ll7,t3_1519ll7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
NootropicLoves,I thought leading forward was only if you were dealing with nasal glands. and that's more so for like irrigation or like infection (anti) stuff. will try,1689599781,jsbdpm5,t3_1519ll7,t1_js9k0cr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Komputer_One,"Off topic question; for brain injuries, a mild one as an example, what treatments are used other than physiotherapy? You can include treatment by medication too. I'm aware of one example that guanfacine can be used to treat injuries to the prefrontal cortex.
