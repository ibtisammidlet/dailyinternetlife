AM_OR_FA_TI,"I‚Äôd add at least 3,000mg Vitamin C spread out 3x daily. And increase Boron to at least 9mg IMO. Many populations across the world with Boron in their soil and water consume as much as 30mg a day and their incidence of arthritis is 0-10% as compared to the US where it‚Äôs 20-70%. The set daily ‚Äúupper limit‚Äù or whatever it‚Äôs called of Boron is 13mg a day.",1689910630,jstlin1,t3_155bii2,t3_155bii2,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Estrogen def is good, but if it gets too high from exogenous sources, your body will produce less testosterone.

Your body uses estrogen levels in a feedback loop to monitor testosterone.  

Basically since testosterone converts to estrogen, if estrogen is too high, your body thinks it‚Äôs because your testosterone is too high ( even though it really might be from phytoestrogens and / or xenoestrogens.) And so it will produce less testosterone.  

So you‚Äôre right In not wanting to suppress endogenous estrogen, but the caveat is you should be limiting exogenous estrogen. 

Calcium Glucarate may be good at removing exogenous estrogen if you‚Äôve recently been exposed.",1689994452,jsybbij,t3_155bii2,t1_jsxbv4t,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
