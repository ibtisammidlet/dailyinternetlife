I hope everyone is doing great!

For the last month, I've been on TAK-653, and I've been feeling great. The reason I started to use it is because I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The medication the doctor prescribed me was making me gain a significant amount of weight, so I stopped taking it. It was really tough to put down the fork, but also I couldn't stop sleeping so much or find the energy to go to the gym and concentrate on college. But before starting with TAK-653, I got my hands on some Phentermine I took for almost six months. I lost all the weight I gained, but once I finished my treatment, the weight started to come back gradually. Sadly, I didn't learn much about self-control. 

Phentermine increased my anxiety and gave me insomnia to the point that the only way to calm me down and go to sleep was through multiple sets of masturbation. The thing is that I got addicted to it. I spent countless nights yerking off until 6 in the morning when I had class at 9am. Sometimes, I had to stop doing homework because I felt a burning sensation in my testicles (not STD related, I got tested, plus I'm blessed to have a loyal partner). The only way to appease that feeling was also through masturbation. It wasn't pretty, mainly because I developed erectile dysfunction (ED), and that hurt my confidence really bad. I had to constantly fight myself and punch the damn wall to remind myself that I had to get my head out of my ass because my future depends on it. So I stopped taking Phentermine when I was about to begin my sixth month of treatment. 

So after doing some research, I found out about nootropics and joined this channel. TAK-653 is the one that interested me the most due to the anecdotal and analogical evidence in many posts. I thought of combining it with Phentermine, but thanks to the advice of some people on this channel, I didn't go through with it. Now, for the last month, I've been taking 0.75mL (3g) of TAK-653 orally, and I genuinely feel great. I've been able to control my addiction to masturbation, my ED has improved, I laugh more, and I can concentrate more easily. However, on the downside, I've noticed sometimes I go hyperfocused on some stupid stuff, like video games or finding a meme I saw weeks ago because I want to show it to my girlfriend. Also, my insomnia hasn't improved, and my appetite is still the same.

I've been taking Berberine 500mg daily three times a day for the last two weeks to control my appetite, but I haven't noticed any change yet. Although I'm still young and have a caloric deficit, it's pretty hard for me to lose weight (25 years old, 5' 8"", 160 lbs). I live an extremely sedentary life due to college. However, I have the commitment to become more active starting next semester. I plan to take fewer classes and start boxing again, but I've been thinking about something, and this is where I need the advice of all my nootropics experts in this subreddit. 

I served in the military for four years. When I went on deployment to Iraq, one of my friends introduced me to SARMs (""the cousins of the steroids,"" he used to say). He promised me there were no side effects and that my friend down there would still be happy when the ladies were around (that's the only thing I was mostly worried about), so we did a full cycle of Ligandrol (LGD-4033). I got pretty big. I achieved my best physique during deployment despite all the crazy shit you expect to see over there. 

After I finished my cycle, I became pretty lazy and stopped working out. Obviously, the effects were fading away, but I also noticed that I started gaining weight more easily since then. Maybe I'm just skeptical or paranoid, but I also suffered from ED right after I finished my cycle (it only lasted a couple of months). Perhaps, that's something that only happened to me, and it's due to other factors, I don't know. 

Now, since I will start working out daily in a few weeks, I've been thinking about taking TAK-653 and a SARM like Cardarine, which targets the cardiovascular system to improve endurance. But, like I mentioned before, here's where I need your advice. 
- How would TAK-653 and SARMs, such as Cardarine or any other, interact?
- Anyone with any previous experience?
- Are there any other compounds that I should try instead for weight loss and cognitive improvement?",False,t5_4aoxhu,TAK-653 & SARMs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14zp2x9/tak653_sarms/
