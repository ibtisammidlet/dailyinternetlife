expanding_crystal,"The other comments here are fair, but I’ll say that when you’re stuck in a rut and need to get your body back into shape, it can help to have some support so it feels like you’re actually making progress. 

It’s my understanding that cardarine and tak-653 work on different receptors. So it’s *probably* fine.

I haven’t tried tak-653, but I can tell you that cardarine is great and like zero side effects as far as I can tell. 

My one caveat is, if you take it that day, you have to use it. I get headaches otherwise. So if you’re on a rest day, don’t take it. But it will increase your cardio and allow you to work your muscles longer, which can help weight loss if you’re also managing your diet. It also seems to do something with suppressing appetite a bit, maybe an insulin modulation thing. I dunno. Good stuff though.",1689367572,jrzexot,t3_14zp2x9,t3_14zp2x9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Hi! Thank you for your answer! If you don't mind, I just have a few questions I would like you to answer. 
- Do you take them together?
If not, which one is the most efficient one for you?
If yes, how many times a day and what route of administration?
- How have you been feeling since you take them?
- How do they work?",1689466481,js4p38o,t3_14zp2x9,t1_js1pjjy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drogison,"get your levels tested, its cheap and easy. A lot of the symptoms you describe match the ones for low testosterone. Look up how to do PCT ([https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/thecycle/pct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/thecycle/pct/)). SARMS suppress your natural production as steroids do. Maybe your doctor will put you on TRT if your levels are your low/low enough. Report back what your exact numbers are",1689496800,js634q1,t3_14zp2x9,t1_js4nydg,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
