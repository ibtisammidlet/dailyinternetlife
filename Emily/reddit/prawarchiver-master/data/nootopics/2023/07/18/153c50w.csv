I prefer this sub.  

Yes there‚Äôs less people here, but they‚Äôre smarter and more knowledgeable.  

This sub also has more of a community feel.",1689728830,jsj4iw1,t3_153c50w,t3_153c50w,20,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"No they banned me, censored my mention and deleted all my posts before I allegedly automated messages of my site in people's inbox with a bot before reddit patched it and made stricter rules against it

The real reason they banned me is because a while back I stopped supporting nootropics depot and science bio, started selling bromantane. $600 worth was sold and then they started trying to label me as a company I didn't work for and took down scientific posts I spent days or weeks creating ages before I even started selling anything

Around that time I was practically the face of r/Nootropics and almost everyone there knew me",1689729807,jsj6ofk,t3_153c50w,t1_jsiq66k,19,False,t5_4aoxhu

lovejackdaniels,"You have my respect. Have been meaning to ask you - what nootropics/ generic meds would you suggest to someone with schizoid personality disorder? My main issue is horrible memory, low motivation(to do anything) and negligible emotions. Surprisingly, on low dose THC (3-4 good puffs), I am very emotional and feel awesome. To me, it looks like my anandamide production is very low and as a result dopamine can‚Äôt go to right places. Thoughts?
I have 23andme gene test, extensive blood panel done and diagnosed with ADHD-PI. MPH doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. No other ADHD drug exist in my country.",1689748984,jsk4mwc,t3_153c50w,t1_jsj6ofk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Sustainable and non addictive dopamine promotion, targets the majority of your issues. And then neboglamine for other schizoid symptoms and memory. Could also add TAK-653 for memory too. As for ""regular supplements"", if there were any good options truly I would've included them in the list. But genuinely worthwhile supplements are a scarcity and they don't really cater towards your issues.",1689776625,jslddsj,t3_153c50w,t1_jskjhbt,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
