lambjenkemead,Try chemyo. I’ve used theirs the past and it was solid,1689187350,jrpc4g0,t3_14x6hrz,t3_14x6hrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"I’ve never gotten anything bunk from nootropicsource, I kinda wonder if your just  not a responder. If you made the side effects post too I’ve evperienced head aches tinnitus etc from 9mebc. And even then it only really works well stacked with nsi 189. 
But umbrellalabs is worth a shot idk their international shipping policy though",1689239035,jrs4kgw,t3_14x6hrz,t3_14x6hrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ZipperZigger,Why not get it from predator if you are in the UK? Price ain't cheap but easy and quality is probably good. Have  couple of bottles. Haven't used them yet.,1691369112,jv3mwcd,t3_14x6hrz,t3_14x6hrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mindless_Jaguar2977,OP did you manage to get any in the end? If so where from bud?,1705996663,kj61yxd,t3_14x6hrz,t3_14x6hrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
hamzazazaA,Do you have any other products of theirs?,1689276711,jrubvt7,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jru2xxe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"They don’t do it sadly, and they have no plans to either unfortunately. But they’ve got good reasons (no human trials)",1689136467,jrmozho,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jrmm15w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"Interesting there’s been conflicting reports. 

Oh no I respond alright, but also feel worse then when I used the science bio source. Makes me wonder if there’s traces of something else in there. 

I got headaches and slight tinnitus before, but tinnitus was fucking immense and it’s been everyday for weeks.",1689264862,jrthw1p,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jrs4kgw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,Wasn’t sure about it quality wise,1691388198,jv4lbbl,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jv3mwcd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"From a redditor who had some to sell, sorry. 

Also 9-me-bc in too large a dose has completely fuked my brain, left me with permentant tinnintus, really disturbing hypnogognic hullucinations, and fucked my sleep, and some symptoms of mild psychosis/schizophrenia, like voices arguging in my head etc. 

Be warned.",1706020587,kj75yx7,t3_14x6hrz,t1_kj61yxd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Ebshoun,"When they told us they would stop selling, I stocked up on everything lol. I only have 9-me-bc left. I understand the concerns of sirsadalot. But to me it has been an amazing substance in terms of dopamine regeneration and it blows bromantane out of the water.",1689321055,jrwq8jx,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jrubvt7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"No human trials, no rodent trials, and predictive analysis flags it as a carcinogen. Yeah, no thanks...

Also it doesn't ""upregulate dopamine"", that's a myth perpetuated by companies trying to sell product. It's a MAOI and that's about it.",1689153977,jrnc6nc,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jrmozho,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,I get bad effects when I take mor than five mg at a time I snort multiple like three mg bumps when I take it but it just wasn’t doing it for me anymore,1689286018,jruykzg,t3_14x6hrz,t1_jrthw1p,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mindless_Jaguar2977,"Oh okay no problem, sorry to hear about that, that's aweful, thanks for the heads up.",1706020768,kj76fie,t3_14x6hrz,t1_kj75yx7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
