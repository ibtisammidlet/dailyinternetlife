Narrow it down with additional research and anecdotes (the latter should **not** carry much weight, no matter how positive/amazing the anecdote, but I still find them useful).

The last sentence is mostly correct. However, if you do your research and gather an appropriate amount of information beforehand, you'll be far less a ""guinea pig.""
