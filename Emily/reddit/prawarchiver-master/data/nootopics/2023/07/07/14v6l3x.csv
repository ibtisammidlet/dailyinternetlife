Fine-Tale2468,"I use the Bromantane nasal spray from EveryChem. I use about seven different intranasal peptides. There is a specific way to do nasal spray peps. Most people do it wrong.

Check out this helpful chart that outlines a couple of different ways. Head leaned forward, chin tucked in and touching chest. Spray each nostril pointing the sprayer toward the outer corner of your eye. Hold the position for at least a minute.

[Check out this diagram](https://imgur.com/a/bUuW0pK), see the guy kneeling? I do this method except I stand, same thing. I just hold the position for as long as I can and then slowly stand up several minutes later. You will get some dripping from the Bromantane because it's a bit more viscous than standard intranasal peps.",1688935067,jrbjcwi,t3_14v6l3x,t3_14v6l3x,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Yes you spray then gently sniff a few times to keep the oil from dropping out of your nose but not do much that it goes down your throat either,1688933449,jrbfhhw,t3_14v6l3x,t3_14v6l3x,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"I‚Äôve only snorted bromantane before. Not recreationally but In roa attempt.


Has anyone trying the spray noticed any immediate kick? I recall thinking whoa ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a bit different‚Äù kinda head rushy thing. Around 15 mg",1688940828,jrbwnbp,t3_14v6l3x,t3_14v6l3x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

ScaryAd5895,"Pardon not a reply to your question, actually a question for you.
I've tried Bromantane in power/crystal and in Glycol. 
Do you feel that the nasal is better? Also where did you purchase yours?
Thanks",1688951507,jrcj97u,t3_14v6l3x,t1_jrbfhhw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fine-Tale2468,One spray each nostril in the morning. If I need another pick me up before noon I will usually do another spray in each nostril. But most days I do fairly well unless I'm exhausted from an illness.,1694571142,k0cm360,t3_14v6l3x,t1_k08fldn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Mehdi_b96,"No problem brother, I'm used to taking it in powder form but when I'm away or on vacation it's not practical so I take the nasal spray but I don't feel the same benefits with it, probably because I don't take it properly.",1688970932,jrdga5g,t3_14v6l3x,t1_jrcj97u,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Fine-Tale2468,This means that you are not in the correct position. Take a look at the diagram again. It should not be dripping more. Don't stand up immediately. Hold the position after doing the spray before standing up. üôèüèº,1694825004,k0ry5h7,t3_14v6l3x,t1_k0nvl5e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fine-Tale2468,"Hmmm tucking head down isn't necessarily correct tho, it might be a matter of making sure nostrils are pointed to ceiling. Chin should touch chest. Nostrils pointed to ceiling not to floor, not pointed to wall. Hold it there for a bit. A little will drop out sometimes. 

This is a really good tutorial but add the [""mecca position""](https://imgur.com/a/OduIrC0) and hold it for a bit. [Good nasal instructions ](https://youtu.be/tnEre7FHUAQ?si=ptmcQufTzbkvDfNJ)",1694827605,k0s3x87,t3_14v6l3x,t1_k0nvl5e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
