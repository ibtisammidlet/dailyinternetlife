Flip4Ever,I vouch for Everychem! Their prices are ….. different … depends on a person….. but I sell 5mg BPC vials for 20 a pop.,1688985434,jrdxq3k,t3_14v9ajh,t3_14v9ajh,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"I've heard positive anecdotes regarding sublingual use as well. Unfortunately, I've also been cautioned that oral use seems to (anecdotally?) be more commonly associated with anhedonic symptoms (I hesitate to use the actual term, given how often it comes up).

That said, there's been an explosion in oral peptide use with BPC-157 and some others. The prices I've seen for some capsule products are insane, yet people are buying them.

From the studies I've read, BPC-157 was considered notable for being able to survive in the gut. The safety results look promising.",1688938585,jrbrn9m,t3_14v9ajh,t3_14v9ajh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
expanding_crystal,What’s EC? I can tell you that ElitePeptides and Alphalabs are legit. Pinning it isn’t bad once you get used to it.,1688964464,jrd78ce,t3_14v9ajh,t3_14v9ajh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Everychem. The one I've seen come up recently is made/sold by LVLUP, but the prices are astronomical.",1688973702,jrdjqsy,t3_14v9ajh,t1_jrd78ce,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Thankkratom,"I’m a pro at using needles, unfortunately not with peptides, and I’m confortable enough with my sobriety to not worry, I just didn’t know if the vile sold by EC was for use like that or not. Was hoping someone had used it that way here so I could hear about how the bottle worked and stuff. I’ll check out those other vendors, thanks for the recommendations.",1689016748,jrfvitl,t3_14v9ajh,t1_jrd78ce,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
