,"MK-677 (as I've read) is best taken at night if you do not want lethargy or overeating. That matches my experience with my own rat, and it seems that you can take it in the morning, and that the lethargy can allegedly go away as some in the rat steroid using community say. 

Apparently it also makes your skin glow, and hair and nails grow faster. My rats skin I believe has gotten better. I think when women say that their skin is ""glowing"" they mean it looks hydrated, aka a little shiny, and I think my skin has been more like that. 

The times my rat has taken MK-677 in a full droppers worth, the rat experienced more anger towards the latter part of the day. MK-677 at 12mg in the morning mad my rat feel different. Maybe more ""alive"" or ""unabashed"", however my rat has trouble expressing this and I have trouble translating. These feels however is not worth the lethargy derived from HGH increases and insulin sensitivity, hence, why you would be thoughtful and give it to your rats at night either 1-3 hours before bed. me and my rat still need to discuss what duration is optimal.

another issue is that my rat has morning responsibilities that have to be attended to and traveled by 8am, and it has not adjusted to it. in fact, it has been waking up at 5:30-6:30 for no reason other than its brain knowing it has work. it has been going to bed at 11-11;30 instead of 9:30-10pm. This it is hard to tell if the reduced sleep duration  of 6-7 hours paired with the deeper sleep MK-677 is known for is helping. I will be happy to see how my rat fares sleep and energy wise once it starts to take it's responsibilities and health seriously. one day, my rat did get 8 hours of proper sleep, and with mk, felt really good. the best slept in many years. I will discipline my rat soon.",1689115085,jrlh8ff,t3_14wxsf3,t3_14wxsf3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Even my girl does it herself Most peptides have to be injected with i repeat, an insulin needle that millions of people use a day for insulin multiple times. That’s the only way and yea you can inject them all at once. The semaglutide is just once a week. Technically cjc/dac can be once a week but i think it’s better to half the dose and take twice a week, I actually think the same with the semaglutide. You just take them with your ghrp there’s literally no difference and you get more constant blood levels plus you’re not injecting a high amount at once. You can replace the ghrp i suppose with the MK, i would just lower dose to like 50mg.

BorgoDorgo3950,"Dear u/BigWhat55535,

I appreciate that you're taking the time to express your thoughts, but I would like to address the tone of your message. While I understand that not every post may capture your interest or resonate with you, it is important to remember that everyone has their own perspectives and reasons for sharing their thoughts. It seems maybe you confused the intent of O.P referring to himself as a rat. The purpose seems to be for humor.

Responding with such a dismissive and rude comment does not contribute to a positive or constructive conversation. Instead, it can be hurtful and discouraging to the person who posted and potentially dissuade them from sharing their ideas in the future. It is crucial to foster an environment of respect and open-mindedness, where diverse opinions and experiences are acknowledged and appreciated.

If you find that a post does not align with your interests, it is perfectly acceptable to move on without leaving negative remarks. By refraining from derogatory comments, we can encourage a more supportive and inclusive online community. Let's remember to engage in conversations with kindness and empathy.

Thank you for considering these thoughts. I hope we can foster a more positive and respectful atmosphere in our interactions.

Best regards,

MrOpioid,"I’m not running it atm. I just did a stupid long fast and ended with a super strong detox i made. I haven’t ran semaglutide either just my wife but she wasn’t consistent or working out, she’s busy with work a lot. With cjc/dac and GHRP-6 it worked pretty well. I took MK too but i never experienced anything off it. I’ve read through the semaglutide research and they would’ve gotten a hell lot of better results with cjc/dac alone and just make it a single shot. I really haven’t responded to much even high doses of like yk11 or lgd. Same with testosterone. I’ve only ever responded to Dbols and made they made me a freak but damn it thinned my hair out within a month so i stopped and it grew back. If I could say anything it was combo of cjc/dac with ghrp-6 because i would get those spikes with the ghrp and the cjc/dac would just potentiate it. I’ve tried MK i actually have some now, doesn’t do anything for me. I really think if you’re trying to shred semaglutide which i don’t think was expensive idk bout now that the fda has just approved it. But that with cjc/dac and either MK or ghrp-x(whichever doesn’t make you hungry probably 2 or 5 but i was fine on 6) would work nice. I wouldn’t use the semaglutide if you weren’t cutting. The cjc/dac and ghrp especially ghrp-6 can make you hungry so that by itself is good for bulking. Just because you respond to carbs better.",1689153158,jrnb6yb,t3_14wxsf3,t1_jrm1wo6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
