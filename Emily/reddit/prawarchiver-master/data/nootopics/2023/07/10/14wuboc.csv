HankHill2160,"I've been looking into this for a while as an anhedonic! It's seems very interesting... **BUT** my concern has been if there is any notable tolerance and withdrawal after long-term usage with PPAP.

I've heard from a few others that say they don't notice withdrawal or a tolerance besides ""behavioral adaptation,"" which feels like a slight tolerance, but it's just one getting used to what they're taking (not the same as tolerance like receptor downregulation / upregulation). Though this happens with anything taken in the long term, although some are less suspectable to this based upon their mindset and/or previous baseline. I wish I could get more feedback from these people to get more info (how long they used PPAP, dosages, etcetera), but sadly, they are now unresponsive.

If you do (or anyone else that reads this) decide to take this in the mid to long term (at least a consistent 2 or 3 weeks and up), please give us feedback! Anecdotes would be great for us anhedonics!! 

**DISCLAIMER:** I am not asking you to test this on yourself. I'm just saying that if you ever did do it on your own terms, the anecdote would be very appreciated!",1689122074,jrlwp6z,t3_14wuboc,t3_14wuboc,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"Thanks for posting this, it's very helpful and interesting too!

I would sure appreciate it if you would also let us know:

1. Did it affect your physical balance at all, positive, negative, no effect?

2. What ROA did you use, and did you take it with anything else like a caffeine source or food or other?

Thanks in advance for any answers and/or tips and all the best too!",1689100883,jrkho1g,t3_14wuboc,t3_14wuboc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SquareOverThere7,"Hey I just want to let you know that I have taken fairly large doses (40-60mg) for weeks-months continually, ran out and suffered zero I’ll effects. Just the lack of the stimulation PPAP gave. I think it’s a pretty forgiving substance.

I also want to know whether anybody has had it cause a false positive in a drug test before? I’m asking because I’ve seen it brought up as a theoretical possibility due to its relationship to selegeline, but wanted to hear if there were any real experiences with drug tests after taking PPAP. Specifically pre-employment",1689130656,jrmeg9q,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrlwp6z,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
That_Bullfrog7696,"I've been using it most days for the last 2 months. I do notice that my dosage has increased over this time, while not needed to feel an effect I do take a higher dose some days to increase the effects of it. I've tried it orally, sublingual, insufflation and vaping it, and have ended up doing insufflation for the last month. There are a few things I would say about long term use of it.

When it is used in high doses (I'm not sure how much exactly, but definitely more than 100mg) it can feel very much like an amphetamine, and the side effects are similar (insomnia, sweating, no appetite, muscle tension). I have on a few occasions used a large amount in one day, and this resulted in a bout of nausea and vomiting after it wears off. I assume this is due to having a large amount of it in your stomach, not eating or drinking, and as it's so acidic it will cause stomach issues in large dosages. It causes irritation and then numbing when taken too, which is reminiscent of both cocaine and certain amphetamines strangely. I've had experience with most stimulants, and it feels like a more controlled version of these. I've had occasions where I begin to get anxious on it, but once I change my train of thought to something less anxiety causing, it instantly goes away. 

In regards to tolerance or withdrawal, tolerance has definitely occurred. It's still very stimulating, but less euphoric, possibly hinting at down regulation of dopamine which I'll have to address at some stage. It also seems to reinforce whatever dopamine releasing behaviours that occur on it, which can be good or bad depending on the user and their habits. I've had days (like after over doing it and causing vomiting) where I have not used it for 2 or 3 days, and have not noticed any withdrawal symptoms, just a feeling that I don't have the enhanced dopamine release. It's a strange but useful substance. I've also used other stimulants on it, and it definitely increases their action and duration. 

I hope this gives you a bit more information, and if there's any other questions feel free to ask!",1691591040,jvg1y30,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrlwp6z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"We often tend to underestimate how much experience and knowledge people here are lacking. More often than not, they actually only spread misinformation. You also can't trust they are themselves correct measuring devices or experiments for such.


That is especially with this true. Because 1: its via an entire novel/understudied mechanism. And 2: it has a big cross over with recreational drugs, so you could easentially experienct vastly polarized, opposing reactions fron that allone",1702828966,kdrk2pe,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrlwp6z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"1.) There was no effect to my balance whatsoever

2.) Oral and just an empty stomach. No other drugs or nootropics were taken, not even caffeine.

I’ve heard taking it with caffeine can cause anxiety but I’m not sure.

Hope that helps :)",1689110040,jrl53qx,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrkho1g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"I have both and I would say there are better options out there for these issues.

It would help but nootropics like Bromantane and Tropisetron are better for social anxiety.

I would say PPAP would be better for getting into the flow of conversations and making them more fun, everything is more humorous so you’d be cracking more jokes and generally smiling more and  in a happier mood.

For PTSD, I would say it would give temporary relief yes.

PPAP is way more “obvious” and stronger than most things I’ve tried before.

I would say try other things first for these issues as PPAP is way too euphoric in my opinion to be used daily or as a cure. 

For temporary relief.. sure.

Long term use… I wouldn’t advise it tbh. Especially as it’s quite unknown.",1689110433,jrl6347,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrko9hb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"Yes it increases the amount of dopamine and noradrenaline released in response to stimulation. 

So instead of releasing dopamine like amphetamines, PPAP only releases more dopamine once dopamine is already being naturally released.",1709800299,ktqo4xe,t3_14wuboc,t1_ktqhxpg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
somadevaismybandok,"My response is far too late, but I was in outpatient rehab (benzo addiction) for 2 months and PPAP was no problem. I would dose two—four times a day (on a particularly boring day and it never popped. Note that I also was scripted Dexmethylphenidate so I don’t know if that might have skewed what they tested for and/or what I would pop for.",1701446082,kbk6huw,t3_14wuboc,t1_jrmeg9q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,No idea about that. It’s not researched enough so I’d avoid any interactions especially SSRIs or anything serotonergic to avoid serotonin syndrome. I know it doesn’t act on serotonin but better to be safe.,1709883407,ktvzte0,t3_14wuboc,t1_ktt4b9o,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MentalConfection9926,"I personally can recommend Selank and Semax injections. Much better overall effect, almost painkiller like, but no stupefaction, that regular painkillers from any store give me.
