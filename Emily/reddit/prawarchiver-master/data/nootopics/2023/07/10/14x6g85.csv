D2_Agonist_Master,"Those side effects are definitely worrying, though I wonder how you still got the benefits of better focus as well. I got mine from Pure Rawz and did not experience this at all. I had also tried some from Swiss Chems and didn’t experience any side effects beside a little bit of photosensitivity.

Edit: going back and reading your post, the 30 mg dosage is definitely significantly higher compared to your 10 mg dosing as you previously did. This could honestly be the culprit.",1689117736,jrln86e,t3_14x6g85,t3_14x6g85,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Odd_Touch4879,"Hey just to make sure, you’re not consuming any processed meats, or any cheese/aged dairy are you? 30 mg of 9 me bc should be enough to inhibit mao enough to cause dangerous reactions to aged foods and most processed foods.

RamityCamity,"I'd recommend Swiss chems or science.bio, kinda pricey but at least you are probably getting real 9-me-bc. I used to order peptides from nootropic source but they are pretty shit.

For fucks sake. So have I been causing damage to myself while I was doing this?

What happened? I’ve had some insane reactions and terrifying amounts of adrenaline some nights.

Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"I love science bio but since it’s been re opened they won’t ship to the UK. 

Deeply sad times, I’m so desperate to keep healing since the last science bio batch healed so much and has been the only thing that seems to have worked at all (recovering from amphs abuse). 

Any chance you could post me some to the UK? I’d pay you double the cost plus postage. Sorry to ask, I’m trying to get some sci bio stuff before the desperation beats out and makes me go back to the nootropic course 9-me-bc",1689265091,jrtiggl,t3_14x6g85,t1_jrp138j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
