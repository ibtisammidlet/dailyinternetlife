When I used Science Bio I felt great, but since I've been using the one from Nootropic source (at a 30mg dose rather then 10mg dose), I've been getting constantly pulsing of blood in parts of brain, brain dog, and constant ringing in my ears, even a couple weeks after the last dose.

Anyone has any suggestions? I want to do another round, but with Science Bio stock, but they're not shipping international orders which sucks so badly.

I'm so desperate. The last time I did it for like 2 weeks with the Sci Bio stock and it reversed a lot of amps abuse anhedonia. And I feel so much better.

This time around I only used the Nootropic Source higher dose probably like 4 times, like once every two weeks. And since then I've definitely felt improvement in my focus abilities which has been really nice, but these side effects are worrying me, and I don' want to use it again if I can get hold of Sci Bio stock.

(Bromantane, even from everychem, has not helped me at all really, sad times. Cere did, but not as much as I need, I'm so desperate to get back a bit more of myself).",False,t5_4aoxhu,Anyone here tried 9-me-bc from Nootropic Source? It's making me feel terrible...

In this post, I'll share my experiences with these substances and their impact on my pet rat. I'll list them based on effectiveness and utility.

&#x200B;

MK-677: This substance surprised me the most as it had noticeable effects on my rat. I initially dosed 15mg at night, expecting it to improve my rat's sleep quality. However, it had a significant appetite-boosting effect. At first, my rat struggled to sleep due to feeling excessively hungry. Eventually, I gave him some delicious peanut butter and cheese, and he consumed around 1000-1200 extra calories. It's important to note that my rat is an active individual who exercises regularly and is relatively lean. To put it in human terms, he's 6'2, 187lbs, with a squat of 275lbs, deadlift of 405lbs, bench of 225lbs, 2.5 plate dips, and a weighted pull-up of 70lbs. During use of MK-677, my rat required less sleep to feel well-rested. Normally, he needed around 8-10 hours, but now 7-9 hours were sufficient for him (1 hour of savings adds to whole 7 hours a week). I have read about potential side effects on insulin sensitivity, which makes me cautious about further dosing as my rat's grandmother had diabetes (if anyone has experience on this matter please advise).

&#x200B;

Pramiracetam HCl: This substance had noticeable effects on my rat, but he didn't enjoy them. It provided a similar sensation to Adderall (my rat is not an active adderall user but had experiences in his college days with it - roughly 4 - 5 years ago), but without the actual focus enhancement. My rat found it difficult to concentrate on reading, writing, studying chess, or doing art. However, it did prove useful for physical activities such as running, walking, and socializing. It seems more suitable for situations that don't require intense focus, as my rat doesn't have issues with anxiety or socializing but felt even greater adept at such matters. The initial dose was within the recommended range, but it felt too strong and caused some brain fog, which my rat disliked.

&#x200B;

TAK-653: This substance requires a follow-up post as its effects are subtle and challenging to quantify accurately. I will continue using it since it seems to have the least impact and possibly works in more subtle ways. My rat doesn't appear to behave significantly differently under its effects.

&#x200B;

On a side note, does anyone else feel this way? My rat complained about the horrible taste of all these chemicals. It's like eating a chemistry set. Surely, there must be a way to make these substances taste delicious for my rat while maintaining their effectiveness?

It was so hard to dose this. I was using a 0.000g scale but in the end I calibrated it perfectly to give me 20mg as my dose. (0.020g)

In half an hour I started to feel something different but I couldn’t quite put my hands on it. Something definitely has changed. I’m generally an anxious person due to years of GABAergic abuse so this made me ever so slightly anxious.

T:01:00

I started to feel slightly warm and pleasant. I have hardly taken any stims at all but this is what 15mg of adderall feels like. It is a little reminiscent without being that pushy.

T:02:00

I’m feeling great at this point. Everything I do or watch or listen to is just enhanced. Even if I watch an Instagram reel that usually I would just skip past is really enjoyable. This would be great for people with anhedonia type symptoms. Definitely an urge to socialise. Anxiety has completely vanished and the thought of it makes me laugh.

T:03:00

Obvious hypomania. I start making my way to the shops to do some shopping and I put the radio on Capital Dance (People from the UK would know) My jaw is starting to wobble a little bit so I reach for some chewing gum. I’m walking and I’m looking at everyone in the eyes. I feel like I look crazy so I look down whilst I walk. Music is starting to sound amazing. For those of you that have done LSD. There is a dopaminergic push that the LSD gives you which feels warm, fuzzy, music sounds great and your skin feels great. It is reminding me of the dopaminergic aspects of LSD over anything else… interesting.. I wonder if the same dopamine receptors are involved. Randomly start cleaning things that I’ve put off around the house. Notice I’m doing this a little aggressively. When I’m cleaning or doing something for some reason, I want to get it done as fast as possible, almost in a competitive way. I’ve never had this before but then again, I don’t take stims so stim
fiends might be able to relate.

T:04:00

It’s not getting any weaker. Also noticing memory recall. Even when a slight noise or song reminds me of a past event, it reminds me of it even if it happened over 10 years ago. When I was shopping, I heard the intro to the “Hello moto” ringtone from someone’s phone a couple of yards away. Just the intro of the song sent me years back to when I had a Motorola with the same ringtone like wtf lmao. And who the hell still has a motorola?? 

T:04:30

Previous effects more pronounced and stronger. I feel like this is the peak. A slight hint of anxiety as well.

T:05:00

Very gradual coming down.. notice my paragraphs are getting smaller as I wrote this live and realise it was quite strong.

T:06:00

I feel like there’s only a slight background effect but feel more sober.


Conclusion:

This felt more recreational/hedonic than nootropic. For nootropic purposes, there’s better options. If you want a good time without it being too damaging and a mood boost, this is for you.

If you’re suffering from anhedonia, this is I believe absolutely fantastic. Especially those you have previously fucked up their dopamine from drug use.",False,t5_4aoxhu,PPAP HCL experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14wuboc/ppap_hcl_experience/
