sirsadalot,You're just going to have to quit. Nothing is going to reverse the sedation of benzodiazepines because it's inherent to the mechanism of these drugs and how they do anything,1689730160,jsj7fvd,t3_15324w0,t3_15324w0,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"Well it would be fighting the GABA increase of benzos. People probably use stimulants for this, but benzos+stimulants seems like a degen stack tbf. I think lethargy is a limitation of benzos' mechanism of action and any nootropics will be limited in how much they can improve negatives.",1689704694,jshhad6,t3_15324w0,t3_15324w0,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
HyperPopped-a-lyrica,"probably something like modafinil, hydrafinil or cyclazodone",1689706384,jshls1c,t3_15324w0,t3_15324w0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Heavy-Individual7103,"Apologies going off topic from your question,what benifits have you felt from bromatane?

I am interested in giving it a try.

Thanks in advance üëç",1689754045,jskb8e3,t3_15324w0,t3_15324w0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Mehdi_b96,"Of course I'm going to stop taking benzodiazepines, but unfortunately I can't stop them cold turkey. I'm going to stop them gradually with the asthon protocol. It's going to take time but I'm going to suffer less.",1689733610,jsjepn1,t3_15324w0,t1_jsj7fvd,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"Maybe I'll microdose the modafinil, but I'm afraid of interactions with benzodiazepines.",1689751529,jsk81wm,t3_15324w0,t1_jshls1c,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"Honestly, when I first take it, it gives me a burst of energy and happiness, I talk to everyone and I'm happy. But after a certain point, it doesn't do much for me. And yet there's no tolerance with this nootropic, so I don't really understand.",1689770667,jskztkq,t3_15324w0,t1_jskb8e3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
HyperPopped-a-lyrica,"I have combined them before, most significant interaction is that they block each other out a bit. You will feel the benzos less and feel modafinil less 

Anyways, why are you even taking benzos in the first place? I would quit taking them as soon as possible, they‚Äôre insanely harmful and addictive 
Hope it‚Äôs only for rare emergency usage otherwise you‚Äôre fucking up your brain bigtime. You can take all the nootropics in the world but benzos will counteract all nootropic benefits and make thinking + memory worse",1689755768,jskddot,t3_15324w0,t1_jsk81wm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
890-2345,"There's really not a lot of interaction between benzos and moda, aside from effects on wakefulness",1689756871,jskeril,t3_15324w0,t1_jsk81wm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
icyeconomics42069,"dont take modafinil long term. its just the next bullshit youll fall into. dont rely on such strong drugs. They all fuck you up. Rely on nutrients and good habits and maybe experimental drugs like 9-me-bc to repair some damage if there is some kind of drug for benzo brain repair. good luck quitting benzos, youll need it",1689787621,jsm6h4f,t3_15324w0,t1_jsk81wm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Heavy-Individual7103,"Interesting,did you change anything in your diet or supplements?
How long until you noticed the effects (Bromantane working)
And when did the effects fade",1689770901,jsl0ahr,t3_15324w0,t1_jskztkq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"I had an episode of anxiety and i listened to the stupid French doctors, which was the biggest mistake of my life. I'm in the process of stopping them with the Ashton protocol, but it's taking a very long time. I take a European benzodiazepine called prazepam, I take 30 mg which is equivalent to 1 mg of xanax, it destroys me.",1689760193,jskiwfi,t3_15324w0,t1_jskddot,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"Yes, I would take it occasionally in very low doses, but NA Semax can be a good counterbalance to fatigue.",1689788061,jsm7o3w,t3_15324w0,t1_jsm6h4f,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"Honestly no, I've always eaten a balanced diet, with supplements like omega 3, vitamin b, c, d. The effects start to arrive after 30 minutes 1 hour I'd say, it depends.",1689771145,jsl0smj,t3_15324w0,t1_jsl0ahr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
HyperPopped-a-lyrica,"Oh I understand, I have also been a benzo addict once. Benzos aren‚Äôt bad necessarily if used sparingly for panic attacks but yea it‚Äôs weird to keep prescribing benzos long term. 

Good luck with your taper, at least you‚Äôre not a really big dose. How long have you been on it? 
The withdrawals are probably not going to be massive or if you have been on them for a long time you shouldn‚Äôt have much or any drowsiness at all",1689763746,jsknqn3,t3_15324w0,t1_jskiwfi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Heavy-Individual7103,"I suppose our body's work in different ways,that's the first I've heard of the effects fading.

Unfortunately There's not much information if your body builds a tolerance to it. But like I said everyone's different,have you tried taking a few days off and going again?",1689771382,jsl1aln,t3_15324w0,t1_jsl0smj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"I've been taking it for 1 and a half years, thanks for the encouraging messages man, I hope the weaning goes well. What benzodiazepine were you taking and at what dosage?",1689764909,jskpid9,t3_15324w0,t1_jsknqn3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
HyperPopped-a-lyrica,"I abused RC benzos like etizolam when it was legal for 8 months or something and then hopped onto 50mg diazepam and tapered from there within 2 months. Was way too quickly and had massive panic attacks and heart palpitations for months after quitting. PAWs
But if 30mg prazepam is equivalent to 10mg diazepam then you shouldn‚Äôt have such big withdrawals as I had. You can do it!",1689765663,jskqpo0,t3_15324w0,t1_jskpid9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Mehdi_b96,"Glad you could make it. Here's hoping I do too. All the best for the future, man. Thanks for the message of encouragement, it makes me very happy",1689768977,jskwiv3,t3_15324w0,t1_jskqpo0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
