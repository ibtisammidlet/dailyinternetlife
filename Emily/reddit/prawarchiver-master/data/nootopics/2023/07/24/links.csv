I read something on wiki that REM is characterized by high acetylcholine activity and low serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine. I know this is super wishful thinking and highly optimistic but have you guys found any substance/noot/drug, preferably non psychadelic, that gives you a similar state of mind to this hypnogogic/pompic state?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Hypnogogic/pompic states,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/158x4a7/hypnogogicpompic_states/

I know this is very hard to make so i assume it is fake the thing is they provide HPLC  on a ""tests"" section on their website which states 97% purity for the Adamax. This is also from a 3rd party?? 

Could this be legit, if anyone knows more it would be greatly appreciated. If the Adamax is fake can their other peptides  be trusted or is it all legit?
