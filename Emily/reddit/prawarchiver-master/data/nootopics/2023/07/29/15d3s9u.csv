Hxmusa,"It won‚Äôt replace vyvanse so don‚Äôt expect the same effects it‚Äôs not that type of stimulant.

The most powerful thing about Bromantane is its ability to subtly get you out of laziness but that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs so subtle and there‚Äôs no euphoria behind it. It also makes you irritable and more prone to OCD type symptoms. 

I am still taking Bromantane just whenever I feel like it maybe once or twice every other week or so.

It will definitely up-regulate dopamine though it will be great once you come off vyvanse if that‚Äôs the plan for you. 

If you want a replacement for vyvanse in the meantime you may want to try more stimulating drugs which are safer like modafinil or semax.",1707693660,kq06d9e,t3_15d3s9u,t1_kpz92k3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Fine-Tale2468,"Sorry, this is probably overkill but thought I would share. 

On TAK-653, 2mg a day. (I titrated up to this) 
Bromantane, IN (intranasal) one spray each nostril. Special formula. 

I supplement with sublingual Bromantane for severe hormone fluctuations that happen once a month. Most people only do one or the other. I noticed that I get an immediate effect from the intranasal but need to increase my Bromantane usage one week out of the month. I get severe avoidance, anxiety and procrastination. 

Intranasal Bromantane has almost an immediate effect. Clear head with energy that is calm and no crash. The sublingual Bromantane is more of a cumulative effect. 

I also take P21 IN once a day cycled 6 months then break. 
NA Semax Amidate IN 
NA Selank Amidate IN 

Just stopped P21 to take a cycle break. The Semax is as needed for alert, brain fog clearing and focus. One spray each nostril one to two times a day before 2pm. I don't take it late due to the need to sleep at night.

The Selank is for evening time for sleep. I'm getting more REM sleep with it. One spray each nostril as needed before bed.

I work in a brain specialty clinic where we have access to wireless qEEG's. I hope to test out my brain processing speed and brain waves next week to see how my research does with the TAK. I have a brain injury so I track my progress with noots and neuro peptides that I take.",1690790014,ju6crtb,t3_15d3s9u,t1_ju4ghva,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
