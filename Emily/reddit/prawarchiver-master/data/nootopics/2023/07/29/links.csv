Namely phenibut as it was a god send for social anxiety and generally being motivated enough to actually talk to people, go out and socialise.

Having a healthy diet, exercising and “scheduling” myself to have a social life helped to an extent but this does not last or did not last for me. The more I tried harder, the more it would push me away from doing those activities as it was too stressful which led to more isolation.

I have tried many other drugs for this and nothing could touch the “edge” that phenibut had. Agmatine sulfate was close, it destroyed anxiety and depression, however it made me quite irritable and it didn’t PUSH me to start conversations.

Bromantane solo was even closer. 4 sprays of Bromantane and it was anxiolytic. However, after a couple hours, I became irritable and aggressive. It pushed me more towards working on goals but I was antisocial unless spoken to.

Guanfacine came in the post today so I proceeded to try 1mg of it with 4 sprays of Bromantane. After a couple hours, it felt like magic. Bromatane’s motivation enhancement effect was obviously enhanced. My talkativeness and willingness to socialise was GREATER than when on phenibut. Phenibut is absolute TRASH compared to this. That’s how good it is.

Reducing noradrenaline is a better solution than increasing GABA as you can still retain your cognition as well as targeting the main issue. 

Personally, I think having an abusive childhood made me have an overactive fight-or-flight system which made my anxiety shoot through the roof at small situations. Getting frustrated and aggressive easily was a huge issue as well. Probably due to getting constantly beaten up by teachers as a child. 

The ingestion of TAK-653 actually made me unlock these memories, put the puzzle pieces together and realise that I needed Guanfacine due to research on noradrenaline and the fight-or-flight system. It was an absolute god send for this. 

Thank you u/sirsadalot for waking up the world.

Edit: Like others mentioned, it is better to wait a month before writing a review. It has been 10 days and I’ve noticed a few changes. The hypomania did stop, however, it still managed to help my social anxiety. I noticed on my Fitbit that my heart rate was decreasing every day and eventually went to 55 rhr which is bradycardia and potentially dangerous. 

I decided to stop Guanfacine and in the following days, it went back up to 60. However, the effects of social anxiety reduction still persisted, even without Bromantane.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane + Guanfacine is the best treatment for social anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15d3s9u/bromantane_guanfacine_is_the_best_treatment_for/
