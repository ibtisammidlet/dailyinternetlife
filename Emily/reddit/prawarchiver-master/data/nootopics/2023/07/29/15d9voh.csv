SandyBad,"I kinda noticed stuff with sleep, really it's supposed to be subtle and in the background. 

Most of the effects were prob from the fresh feeling in your nasal cavity from the spray itself.",1690770169,ju5i2tb,t3_15d9voh,t1_ju1441c,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Pure_Nourishment,"I suppose it would benefit me to join that discord. It's not as if all the products have the same mechanism or purpose though, so it's kinda wild to suggest there are better things when you have no idea what my goals are.

Thanks for the nudge to join the Discord",1690770629,ju5j01a,t3_15d9voh,t1_ju5hzn4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SandyBad,"can we stop being mean to each other. this is wrong. 

You don't know why I think there's better things and I don't know why you really want it. 

I would think someone who really knows their stuff ab pinealon would have read the research by the only person who carries it as a spray online and would be familiar with the community. 

You're right that I don't know what your goals are, and honestly I wonder why you didn't just ask what I thought was better. Maybe you just don't want to explain anything and say things like ""ouhh uhhh, you don't know my goals, ur like totally wild"" so that I look bad and you can project your ego with emojis and ummm whats? 

If you talked like that in real life everyone would look at your weirdly lmao. but that's ok because I know we have a lot of distinct individuals that make their way into their community. nootorpics? pfffh what is that? 

don't respond you're just weird and you obviously don't want to converse and instead try and make others look bad",1690770966,ju5joct,t3_15d9voh,t1_ju5j01a,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
