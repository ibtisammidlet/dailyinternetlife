Don‘t know if anyone remembers him.

Well, it’s about taking 7 different supps/noots/herbs or drugs for 7 days, every (second) one needs to have a completely different biochemical way of psychopharmacological acting so that one never targets same receptors or systems of the body and mind for 2, best 3 or more days in a row.

Looking at rather pharmacological drugs it could be (for example) consisting of:
- Serotonergic
- Opioidergic
- NMDA antagonist
- GABAergic
- VGCC-blocker
- Dopaminergic/Noradrenergic
- Antihistaminergic
- Also possible: Acetylcholinic (just can‘t tell any worthy substances to add to a cycle for this, do you?)

What‘s your opinion on this to reduce risk of any tolerance, dependance and withdrawal?

Do you cycle somehow similar to this way?
