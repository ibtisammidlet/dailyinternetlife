PicoDeBayou,"New (third week) user here. I get great, non jittery, clean energy, when I take it and make myself start doing stuff. If I just lay around, I feel as if I haven’t taken anything and would likely be slightly lethargic as usual. It’s been a game changer for me with more stamina at the gym and in general, As Ive struggled with motivation and low energy for years. I introduced my sister to it and she’s had a similar experience as mine. I don’t do it every day though and have noticed residual effects. An absolute godsend for me personally. 46 year old dad.

Also noticed it’s very dose dependent. One spray is usually enough, maybe two. But more than that and it doesn’t work or has opposite effect. So cool!

I even still take my usual 45 minute power naps in the afternoons no problem.",1688332169,jqfecq8,t3_14ox0l2,t3_14ox0l2,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"If I see positive effects after I stop, I lower the dose and see the effects on the same day instead.

Bromantane effects do last for 1 month after discontinuation though",1688327127,jqf2ka9,t3_14ox0l2,t3_14ox0l2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Psychological-Park48,I've come to realize that bromantane makes me feel terribly unmotivated for about 6 hours after taking it (just 2 sprays total). I'm thinking about taking it just before bed to see if I can wake up feeling good.,1688328622,jqf61u5,t3_14ox0l2,t3_14ox0l2,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"I have trouble getting the spray right, and it sucks. 

For me, the effect lasts about 24 hours. Then it's back to normal.",1688337398,jqfppr0,t3_14ox0l2,t3_14ox0l2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Ghibl-i_l,"I feel both. During (daily 1 spray each nostril, sometimes 1 extra if I feel it leaked out) I feel some effects (noticeable anxiolytic, some motivation, seeming improved reaction speed, at least for the first few days, the ""euphoria phase"" ,then as I keep taking it, after about 2 weeks on it I look back and see how I am more motivated and am able to start tasks much easier and how my average productivity over the last weeks has jumped significantly. 

Then also I feel it for 1-2 months after my spray bottle is over. 

I read that allegedly Bromantane is stored in fat tissue and is weirdly released over some period of time after cessation (which is why some sportsmen had clean reading one week (a few weeks after stopping taking it) but then had a dirty reading the next week). Though this might be complete BS which people made up to excuse the doping violations.

Either way, yes, I undoubtedly feel more productive while on it and 1-2 months after I stop taking the course/spray bottle is finished.

Edit:
Yeah I also noticed that seemingly not always bigger dose = better effect. I do think finding your sweet spot is a thing with this, as is with many nootropics, even with coffee.",1688365843,jqh4unm,t3_14ox0l2,t3_14ox0l2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,"Yes I tried 2 sprays each side before because I wasn’t sure if it sprayed or not and I felt like absolute shit as if I was sick. Now I do one spray and totally agree with you there. However I don’t get crazy energy, not really any anxiolytic effect, and I notice when I’m doing stuff while on it it’s not like I’m focused in the zone doing the task it’s more like a zoned out thinking about something completely different while doing tasks and they’re just getting done without focus sort of thing similar to thc.",1688343676,jqg2mw2,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqfecq8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,I’ve been doing one spray before bed because they say it takes 4-6 hours to kick in and I notice when you dose you do get a tired feeling especially from two sprays in my experience. Only taking one before sleep and waking up I feel a little more ready to go while noticing some positive effects but it also makes your sleep a lot deeper for some reason. Missed my alarm for work today because of it.,1688343024,jqg1bn8,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqf61u5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,Yeah it’s not a typical liquid like noopept spray hard to tell if you got the dose or not. Also sometimes the bottle is not primed and it sprays air.,1688343094,jqg1gpv,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqfppr0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,True that except this hasn’t really shown any stimulant activity to me. I do notice while working out it feels like alpha gpc as in I can find the correct positions faster and do more reps but that’s about it. I don’t even really experience the anti anxiety effects people talk about either.,1688343308,jqg1wbq,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqfzgd5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"yeah, I think over time the bottle gets worse at doing a fine mist, and then the... texture? of the liquid is just hard to work with. idk. I'm annoyed by it. It should have come with a guide but I might just be a special case",1688347542,jqgaaon,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqg1gpv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dylan_0001,It is hard to work with it’s like an oil that you cannot sense or feel leaking out of your nose which most of the time it does. I have to prime the bottle first to be sure and waste a little bit put it way up my nose and spray and lay with my head back for awhile for it to not leak and be effective.,1688352358,jqgjij7,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqgaaon,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"I've also noticed what seems to be some minor degradation of the sprayer mist when the bottle starts to get a bit on the low side. The bromantane doesn't appear to be that low, but it's for this reason that I've never actually finished a bottle. Instead, I wait until the sprayer becomes unacceptably inconsistent, then switch to a new bottle.

Normally, I'd clean the nozzle by running it under warm water, just as I'd do for Flonase or similar. However, due to the oil-based formulation, I'm not sure water would work anyway.

I think you'd have to use isopropyl alcohol, which is already getting too complicated for me (I have plenty, but I friggin hate working with it). The bottle design itself also makes me reluctant to attempt cleaning; I'd rather just save myself the hassle and use a fresh one.

You're not a special case. The only reason I **didn't** have a considerable amount of difficulty was b/c I'd been following a number of threads on this topic.",1688376340,jqhho47,t3_14ox0l2,t1_jqgaaon,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
