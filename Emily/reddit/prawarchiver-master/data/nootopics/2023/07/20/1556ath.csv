BigWhat55535,"Probably not. Depression is very complicated. If it was just brain inflammation or 'opioid stuff', then it would have been figured out long ago.

My guess? Depression is a hibernation of the mind, caused either by biological triggers in the environment (diet, sleep, exercise, and more), or psychological circumstances (trauma, learned helplessness, inescapable mental anguish, chronic stress, more...)",1689944455,jsv0dau,t3_1556ath,t3_1556ath,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
AM_OR_FA_TI,"I am of the firm belief that a majority of major depressive disorders are due to malnutrition, undernourishment of vitamins / minerals and INFLAMMATION, yes. The primary cause of nearly every chronic illness and disease. There’s a reason that people who take RX Diclofenac report reduced depression and anxiety as a “side effect” of the NSAID. Studies have also linked Aspirin and Ibuprofen to reduced depression in patients. The link is clear…",1689911219,jstmlu3,t3_1556ath,t3_1556ath,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

DifficultRoad,"I'm on medication for my MS (Copaxone) and will be switched to a new one (Tecfidera) in a few months. Both are lower efficacy than B-cell depleting drugs like Ocrevus, albeit with lower severe side effect risks. In any case the lower tier drugs are the only ones I can get for now, because my MS was classified as ""mild"" so far, and legislation in my country doesn't allow for the higher effecacy drugs in this case. It's not ideal, but I can't change that.

I get my thyroid checked regularly because they found Hashimoto's antibodies 11 years ago. In all this time my thyroid hormones (TSH, t3 and t4) have been great through, so there was no need to take any. I guess it's dormant for now, just another piece of the whole autoimmune-inflammatory thing. Might change at some point, we'll see. I will look into liotironine though!",1690005987,jsyu0gv,t3_1556ath,t1_jsuu9st,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
