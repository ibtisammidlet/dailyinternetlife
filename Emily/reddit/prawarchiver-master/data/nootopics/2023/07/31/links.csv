I still feel better today but its wearing off

Ive taken  Bromantane like a few times before but never noticed that much. Never took it days in a row but here and there. 

And today I took 1 mg TAK-653 by itself but don’t notice anything. Idk what it was. 

Do Bromantane and TAK653 synergize in some way? 

Could this just have been some honeymoon first time effect of TAK-653?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Are Bromantane and TAK synergistic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15eujih/are_bromantane_and_tak_synergistic/
