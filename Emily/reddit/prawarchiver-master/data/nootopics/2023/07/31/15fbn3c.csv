,"About half of selegiline converts to amphetamine when taken orally.   
I've been on 5mg since March 2021, and I get off on holidays. It does build a tolerance, but I still get a quick burst of stimulation for the first 2-3 hours after taking it. Then it mellows out a bit, but never disappears due to long acting MAO-B inhibition.   
Stack well with other dopaminergic stuff at low doses, like 30-50mg caffeine, 125mcg nicotine.   

I cannot compare it to other stims without knowing about your background, the highest dosages that you build tolerance for. But I guess it is sustainable for a stim ""virgin"" like me at a low dose.  

Also, heard it shows as amph in drug tests due to conversion, so might not be ideal if that's why you are moving away from amphs.",1690896115,juc8a9x,t3_15fbn3c,t3_15fbn3c,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
w0rld-Peace,"It's very common that people experience a couple weeks long ""honey moon""-phase, and then it'll stop working and/or make the user irritable.

I believe it has to be cycled somehow to ensure long term effectiveness. But how, that I just dont know.

I think bromantane would be a better and more sustainable option.  


Personally, I take 25mg 9-Me-BC and a microdose street amph when needed. The effect lasts almost whole day.",1690921381,jue2iin,t3_15fbn3c,t3_15fbn3c,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spartuhns2,Seems like amphetamines build some kind of long term dopamine deficits causing long term lack of motivation if not using. Was tryna figure out if MAOB inhibition is more sustainable without  causing this issue. I know sellegeline does metabolize into amph but it’s neuroprotective to dopamine receptors. And I just wanna know if MAOB is considered better for the brain in that maybe it doesn’t cause the same “long lasting deficits” as amph does,1690900316,jucid0a,t3_15fbn3c,t1_juc8a9x,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
