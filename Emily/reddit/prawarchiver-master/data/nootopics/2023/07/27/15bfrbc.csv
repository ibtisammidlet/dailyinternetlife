I too am going to reduce and stop benzos with the Ashton protocol. I'm going to go through some tough times, but I've got no choice.",1690498401,jtqa1bx,t3_15bfrbc,t3_15bfrbc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

orbitalLlama,"Ive been throuh the absolute hell that is benzo withdrawl and if i could give myself one piece of advice it would be to stay the fuck away from anything and everthing. Clean eating and exercise are the only things you need. I made my withdrawl process so much harder and longer by trying to fix symptoms with nootropics/ supplements. Somethings may help in the short term but in the long term it will just delay the healing of your gaba receptors. Also stay away from cerebrolysin during benzo withdrawl. It helped me for a few months until one day all the benefits evaporated. I developed the worst neuropathy of my life, i become severely hypomanic for a few weeks and i lost a good chunk of my verbal/ reading ability for 6 months with it slowly returning over the next 2 years(but never 100%). I think i may be an extreme case and I was just very sensitive to kindling but its not worth the risk at all. imo you should throw out all ur nootropics until you have fully healed. Start developing good clean eating habits and an exercise routine that will get your cardiovascular system working.

good luck.",1690535713,jts4zkp,t3_15bfrbc,t3_15bfrbc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Just was really checking if ok to use during taper as the “ benzo police “ on some forums so you cant you supplements that affect gaba during taper and will make it worse . Seem to be getting differing opinions.

Mehdi_b96,"Yes, I understand. In my opinion, you shouldn't expect a miracle product to fix everything, even though there are certainly supplements that can help.

orbitalLlama,"I used Xanax to taper off my alcohol addiction and then became dependent on Xanax for quite a while. I’m not going to pretend I understand all the chemistry because Benzo's withdrawal is very complicated. I can only speak from my personal experience. I found NAC helped a little, but in the long run, it made things worse. I’m not the only person who’s experienced that either. I have no experience with agmatine so I can really speak on that, but from a quick search, I can see that it increases GABA so I would avoid it. In my experience taking any supplements that affect GABA just delays your brain's natural healing. You should head over to r/benzowithdrawal.
