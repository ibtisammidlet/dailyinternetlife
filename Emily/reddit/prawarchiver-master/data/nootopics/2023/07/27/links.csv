   Im currently slowly tapering a benzo and going ok thus far.
Im looking for advice on things that can support taper and afterwards .
A leading benzo taper clinic in UK recommends magnolia bark and lemon balm during taper to aid sleep . 
Whats peoples thoughts on this ?
Atm using some agmatine at night and NAC. 

Also post taper . Anything people recommend to speed up healing of the brain once im off them . 
I was looking into emoxypine and cerebroylsum . 

Any thoughts on this ? 

thanks",False,t5_4aoxhu,Nootropics during and post benzo taper,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15bfrbc/nootropics_during_and_post_benzo_taper/
