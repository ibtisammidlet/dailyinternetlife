,"Memory and cognitive functions is very broad. I would join the nootopics discord and ask sirsadalot. Everychem has everything you'd want, especially the exclusive Bromantane nasal spray, but not everything on that website is useful. 

What exactly do you want? Do you just want the most effective thing to try?",1688347724,jqgan71,t3_14p38q8,t3_14p38q8,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

faxafi,"There's tons out there but most don't really ""work"" in my experience. While I'm sure a lot of noots out there do make a less noticable different I still feel like a lot of people benifit a lot more from the placebo effect then they realize. Just something to keep in mind.

With that said these are the compounds I think made the biggest difference in my experience. 

Supplements:

L-tyrosine 
Magnesium
Zinc
Omega 3-6-9
Vitamin B 6-9-12 + D


None of the nootropics are gonna work well if your deficient in these vitamins since they're all used in neurotransmitter production and signaling. Honestly within a few weeks makes a bigger difference then any single noot. 


Nootropics:

A+
Noopept nasal spray - for acute focus 
Selegiline + modafinil low dosage for energy & motivation
Donepezil for memory hands down. Tried after noticing reduction in ADHD symptoms from Huperzine-A. 
Cialis - use it for muscle building, pumps, increased testosterone & of course ED

B+
Caffeine 
Bromantane
Uradine monophosphate 
Creatine
Racetams
NAC 
L-theanine 

I also use nebivolol as it lowers heart rate and stress slightly & a few other compunds to boost test without shutting down productions naturally",1688436796,jql1c8j,t3_14p38q8,t3_14p38q8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
MrsAMPA-PAM,"DYOR don’t take random stuff people recommend without understanding what it does and what to be careful about or look out for while doing said stuff. 

I recommend looking into bromantane and for sure Alcar. I personally like alpha gpc and uridine monophosphate but they don’t provide a permanent benefit and a lot of people disagree so look into it yourself and decide how to continue. SirSad has a lot of resources and citations. If you don’t understand them fully chat gpt is your friend. Don’t 100% depend on it to think for you, but it can help you understand harder sources more easily.",1688410155,jqjeona,t3_14p38q8,t3_14p38q8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"__TLDR:__
- Individual responses can vary greatly
- Clearly define your goals, whether short-term or long-term
- **Always** do your own research, don't be lazy and rely on anecdotes
- Also don't over-rely on science; despite what many would have you believe, we don't have it all figured out...
- Manage your expectations: IME, very few noots even approach the strength of pharmaceuticals (EC does have some interesting ones, but they're behind an ""application barrier"")
- (cont.) Prepare to be disappointed and underwhelmed with the majority of stuff out there


All the references and science don't really mean jack if your personal biochemistry is altered or simply different/incompatible. Many variables are likely responsible, which are too numerous to list (e.g., environment, air quality, climate, exposure to extreme and/or chronic stress, current/previous infections, etc.).

I'm not convinced that no/minimal response indicates any sort of damage. While /u/sirsadalot does a superb job of researching the various substances EC carries, the reality is that a good deal of pharmacology and/or biochemistry is not well understood.

As a result, the mechanism of action (MoA) for many substances is the result of hypothesizing, and/or drawing inferences or ""likely explanations/conclusions."" Basically what doctors typically do: educated guessing.

Some individuals, unfortunately, simply fall into the category of non-responders or even chronic non-responders (aka they're ""treatment resistant""). Trust me, just b/c the **current** science says ""x substance should produce 'y' effect(s)"" doesn't make it so.",1688430479,jqkp1oy,t3_14p38q8,t1_jqjeona,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
