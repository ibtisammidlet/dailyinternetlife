donniedenier,"if you want to play it safe and over the counter, i’ve seen amazing results with agmatine.

i take prescribed adderall 5 days a week and over the last month it’s just barely been working on me anymore.

i started taking 1g of agmatine per day and literally the next day my adderall dose was way more effective and i have almost no negative side effects from the agmatine except for irregular sleep/insomnia if i take it at night.",1690640119,jty16s1,t3_15cruhw,t3_15cruhw,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"Yes. Both helped me a lot. 9-me-bc has helped me the most, but the warnings about it having no human trials are serious. 

It’s helped me a lot but the side effects have been hard to handle and quite frankly scary. 

It brought my brain dangerously close to psychosis. And I’m not the only one who had experienced this. 

It was in fact more powerful and drastically more intense then the usual physical symptoms of the early stages/pre-psychosis. 

But I managed to ride it out through grounding techniques and gratitude mindfulness while my body went on a rather scary roller coaster that’s lasted weeks, while my brain normalises. 

It’s no fucking joke.

The guys on the discord said any other chemical similar to 9-me-bc but after would be better, like Parnate from PGLChem. 

But I haven’t tried it yet, (waiting a couple months for my brain to normalise and recover). 

Also 9-me-bc from any other company then sci bio is dangerous because similar chemicals made in the process are neurotoxic.

And the one time I used 9-me-bc from some where other then from sci bio I ended up giving myself self ototoxcity (chemical poisoning of hearing). 

And suffered the most extreme tinnitus you could imagine for weeks and might have tinnitus for the rest of my life now.

Scare story, but worth being honest with you about what happens to a lot of people but probably just not reported. 

But have found some peoples comments and post about 9-me-bc and these side effects only AFTER I used it. So just giving you information.",1690637037,jtxu0yf,t3_15cruhw,t3_15cruhw,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"Right now I got a bit of feeling back (had extreme anhedonia from amphs abuse) and I’m grateful for it. No telling of my brain will stay in this state of primed for psychosis for the rest of my life or go away. 

But right now my plan is to let my brain and MAOI-B recover (takes months for brain to recover MAOI-B after 9-me-bc)…

And to try Joe Dispenza type healing meditations to hopefully hack the placebo effect to heal the rat without having to risk psychosis with 9-me-bc again.",1690637280,jtxuj66,t3_15cruhw,t1_jtxu0yf,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

donniedenier,"haven’t tried it, personally. i try my best to stick to the bare minimum as far as stimulants. i need them as medication so i try and take what i need to stay efficient and don’t really take anything more beyond that to try and keep my tolerance down.

i feel super lucky to have stumbled on agmatine though. i got the Nutricost brand on Amazon for like $11 or something and it’s for sure worth every penny.

i’ve been told to cycle it for like 3 months at a time i think? so i’ll probably take it til i finish this bottle then take a break from it.",1690811781,ju7bu6l,t3_15cruhw,t1_ju7axwn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
D2_Agonist_Master,"This is not the case with 9mebc, as it’s a reversible MAOi. This means it does not deactivate the enzyme permanently like how non-reversible MAOis do. Once 9mebc is metabolized and unbinds from the MAO molecule, then the molecule returns to function. Also, it’s stronger as a MAO-A inhibitor. It’s relatively weak as a MAO-B inhibitor.

“Additionally, 9-me-BC showed inhibitory properties to monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity with an IC50 value of 1 µM for MAO-A and of 15.5 µM for MAO-B. “

CryptoEscape,"Wow.  So with less MAOI- B , even after discontinuing 9-me-bc, you essentially still have more dopamine and norepinephrine due to the lack of MAO - B to break it down?

Lasers_Pew_Pew_Pew,"I’m not sure if that’s exactly how it works. But if it does work like that then essentially I’m in a weird state of too much dopamine until the MAOI-B recovers and it’s safe to try another round or even any other dopamine increasing nootropics, as it would seemingly increased the risk of psychosis. 

It is getting better though, so feels like my brain is slowly normalising.",1690663399,jtzmpnf,t3_15cruhw,t1_jtzlkis,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
D2_Agonist_Master,No problem. It really begs the question too as to how much Serotonin is elevated by 9mebc due to the MAO-A inhibition. As well as beta carbolines being known to agonize certain 5ht receptors.,1690763073,ju53edu,t3_15cruhw,t1_ju52hov,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
