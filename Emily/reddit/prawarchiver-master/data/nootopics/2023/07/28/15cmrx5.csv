w0rld-Peace,"I recommend 15-25mg 9-Me-BC for 20+ days. You will probably need few cycles to fully heal though. It will regenerate your dopamine system and upregulate d2 receptors. You can take it together with other dopamine healers like forskolin and ALCAR. Lions Mane helps with cravings and is good for neuron regeneration so I'd consider taking that as well.

If you want to go hardcore you can combine with dopamine antagonists like quetiapine, which will upregulate your receptors even faster. It's very effective, but you will sleep whole day. (which actually can be good, since you wont engage in any dopaminergic activities that way). It starts to antagonize dopamine receptors at \~200mg but I suggest at least 300mg+, twice a day.  


It's said that it usually take around a year to heal. It wouldn't surprise me if you could heal in 3 month using the above methods though. I'm using the same methods currently with great success.",1690648711,jtym71n,t3_15cmrx5,t3_15cmrx5,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

ok-yess123,"On the side, Easy Peasy Method, as it’s the best way to learn how to become free from addiction, by margin.

All things ppl said are good.
BPC-157 might be the only extra. Might spin some magic tricks on CREB/cFOS. You can do more research on that in particular, I barely recall something similar.

I tend to believe that we’ve got an issue there with CREB/cFOS more than D2 receptors. Working on D2 receptors would ‘level you up’ giving u a feel of normality, while that’s in CREB/cFOS that there’s the core issue.

Super anecdotally: people feeling normal for a few days after relapsing. Because of dopamine surge from stimulation? Not that much half life. Why they feel normal, if they’re desensitivized? They’d just need to feel ‘bad’ anyways.
So it’s more about molecular switches of CREB/cFOS, influenced by deltaFosb accumulation.",1690876921,jubdzb7,t3_15cmrx5,t3_15cmrx5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

juloaj,"Appreciate your response, this is very interesting. So you would say your experience with 9-Me-BC has been very positive in helping you recover ?

I just read about quetiapine and it seems rather extreme, I'm not sure if you're knowledgeable in that regard but would something like sulbutiamine be a better alternative ? It seems like it upregulates the dopamine receptors while not having as many negative effects has seroquel/quetiapine.

I will read about forskolin, I already ordered ALCAR, Uridine & cordyceps as they all may upregulate dopamine.

Lions mane is interesting but I'm not sure I wanna mess with it as it seems like it is a 5AR inhibitor, would the mechanism of action for neuron regeneration be different than potentially semax/cerebrolysin ?

juloaj,"Very interesting, thanks. I will look into the mechanisms & neurotransmitters you mentioned, I'm still very new to all this.

Basically D2 upregulation would be interesting in the case of severe flatline causing low mood, anhedonia, low focus... Right ? As far as recovery goes, getting over the addictive tendencies and such, you're saying some other pathways may be better to target, is that correct ?

I've read that NMDA antagonist may also help, glutamate receptors seem to also have their importance but then again I'm not sure.

What do you think about increasing BDNF to promote neuroplasticity and the learning of new habits to replace the addictive behaviors ?",1690881177,jubjd6a,t3_15cmrx5,t1_jubdzb7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

w0rld-Peace,"My pleasure!  
Oh yes, 9-Me-BC has been incredibly helpful in my recovery from the damage made from a decade of stims and other addictions. It's the most powerful dopamine restoration compound there is, most probably. I wish I would've found it earlier.

Quetiapine is a bit extreme so definitely not for everyone. Regarding sulbutiamine, I don't think it would hurt to add, if you have money to spend, it's to my knowledge pretty innocuous. But is it effective at restoring? Idk.  


Like, I've been taking ALCAR, uridine, citicolin, cordyceps and forskolin for months. I'm sure they help with the recovery process, so I think it's a good idea to take them, but I can't really say I've felt any noticable difference from them. It was only when I added 9-Me-BC/quetiapine I started to really feel better.  


You most definitely can replace quetiapine with regular dopamine detox-days though. I'm sure that will help a lot. I personally cannot do it. Using stuff like quetiapine is dopamine detoxing on steroids.

The reason I suggested Lions mane is mainly because it removes sexual interest, so it'll help you not watch porn etc. Cerebrolysin will definitely help speed up the recovery by promoting neuron growth, neuroplasticity etc.   


To sum up what I believe to be the most important ""healers"":  
1. 9-Me-BC  
2. Dopamine detox (which can be supercharged with antagonists like quetiapine)  
3. Daily exercise

Everything else I think only should be seen as accessory, but you definitely want to make sure you're keeping the brain neuroplastic!  


Good luck with your recovery bro!",1690657086,jtz7edr,t3_15cmrx5,t1_jtyvam5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

ok-yess123,"“Flat line”, “cravings”, and so on. Psyops. U’re not going to make it if u frame things like that.

Easy Peasy Method. Then bother about pills & supplements.

Better dopamine status leads to less likely abuse.
Modafinil an example, studies on cocaine and meth addicts.

NMDA antagonism should increase D2 receptors density.
