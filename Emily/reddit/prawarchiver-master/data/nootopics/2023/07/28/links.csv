I'm beginning to get out of a two year period of severe depression but I don't feel 100% better yet. There are times where the depressive thoughts return and I feel hopeless. I suspect that the effects of social isolation during this two year period are what's holding me back (Slow cognition, poor verbal fluency, etc.). Is there anything that can help me reverse the damage (besides increased social connection, which I'm already doing)?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Reversing the effects of social isolation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15d0owc/reversing_the_effects_of_social_isolation/

&#x200B;

I've been struggling with porn addiction for a while and I'm currently recovering, I'm making good strides but I'm looking to optimize my recovery with nootropics & compounds if possible so that it's smoother, faster... I got real side effects, I have ED that gets better with time, brainfog, struggle with concentration...

From my understanding many things are at play, habits & neural pathways I've built, dopamine downregulation, pre-frontal cortex atrophy...

As such I'm thinking that upregulating dopamine and increasing BDNF for neuroplasticity & new habits building could be good mechanisms of action.

&#x200B;

Obviously does not substitute with proper therapy, meditation, exercise, sleep, diet... But I've been wondering if cerebrolysin, NSI-189, 9-me-BC, Semax could all help for different reasons, Bromantane & Noopept as-well, what would be your advice on the things that may yield the most results ?

&#x200B;

I've already ordered Uridine, Alcar, Alpha gpc amongst other things that may upregulate dopamine, I also ordered NAC as it may help with fighting cravings and leveling myself out.

&#x200B;

I strongly consider purchasing semax for the potential pre frontal cortex and bdnf benefits, NSI-189 is also intriguing to me. Cerebrolysin looks like a fantastic compound altho expensive, which is why I would look into it in a last resort kind of way.

&#x200B;

Any advices on how I could improve my recovery is appreciated, thanks.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Can I improve my addiction recovery ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15cmrx5/can_i_improve_my_addiction_recovery/
