SandyBad,"pregnenolone has studies on this, I take 100mg but pair it with CDG to keep hormone balance. If I were you buy 10mg pills and play with that until you think 50mg or 100mg can work for you. 

other everychem noots like take, brom etc will help, but I like pregnenolone a lot for this.",1690675828,ju0f02a,t3_15d0owc,t3_15d0owc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
ayatollahdanger,"Two years? Ive been alone since i was 14 (Im a 26 year old neet now), and honestly it just gets harder. My plan is to use a combination of Nootropics and treatments to potentially undo my damages, which include but not limited to Anhedonia, Extreme Depression, Executive Dysfunction,  Lack of focus and loss of Verbal fluency.
I'm targeting Neurogenesis to regain lost synapses due to depression and relearn poaitive behaviors, im looking for HDAC inhibitors to undo fear learning and erase whats subconsciously holding me back and I'm planning on going to a psychologist to help me properly identify my shortcomings and problems.

For Neurogenesis:
NSI 189
Lions Mane
Adamax
Tak 653
Dihexa
P21
Fisetin
TDCS

For fear extinction/Anxiety reduction
Vorinostat 
Lithium Orate

resinsuckle,I went through the exact same thing and noticed testosterone boosters to be the most effective. Tongkat Ali is the best one to start off with. You can also take tribulus terrestris for added confidence that stacks quite nicely. Be sure to find a good magnesium that isn't in oxide or citrate form. Eat lots of nuts and meat for zinc and magnesium.,1690762551,ju52as4,t3_15d0owc,t3_15d0owc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Jeannnnnnnnnn,"Noradrenaline is thought to be a major player in verbal fluency. Low noradrenaline causes difficulty finding the right words etc. Next to noradrenaline dopamine ofcourse helps as it is related. Both within some amounts (bell shaped response curve)

Serotonin also tends to have to do a lot with stuff like this such as social isolation/depression and mood/cognitive issues. Although serotonin seems rather complex to me (don't know fs if it's always good to fuck with)

So something that raises adrenaline, an SNRI or a stimulant if you have adhd. (Because a stimulant would do more than merely effect noradrenaline, but it would cause adverse effects and dependency if you don't really need it apart from a temporary thing)",1693919859,jz89vs5,t3_15d0owc,t3_15d0owc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
