Myloux,"I second NAC for lowering glutamate. However, know that increasing GABA can also indirectly lower it since GABA acts like the ""brakes"" in a neuron, preventing it from becoming overexcited. I recommend looking into the following which I have personally tried (and AI has helped me sum up):

&#x200B;

**NAC (N-acetyl cysteine):** NAC is an amino acid and antioxidant that can modulate glutamate levels and enhance the synthesis of glutathione, a key antioxidant in your body. It's used for a variety of health issues including mood disorders, brain health, and inflammation. Some research has suggested that NAC may help to reduce the excitotoxicity caused by too much glutamate.

**Inositol:** Sometimes referred to as vitamin B8, inositol plays an important role in neurotransmitter signaling and can influence the action of glutamate. Some studies suggest that inositol supplementation may help in reducing anxiety and panic disorders, conditions often associated with an imbalance between GABA and glutamate.

**Magnesium:** This essential mineral acts as a natural NMDA receptor antagonist, which can block the effects of excess glutamate and potentially prevent its excitotoxic effects.

**Taurine:** This amino acid can act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in your brain, where it can trigger GABA receptors much like GABA itself. It also has a protective effect against glutamate excitotoxicity.

**L-Theanine:** Found in tea, especially in green tea, L-Theanine can increase levels of GABA and other calming brain chemicals. It also reduces levels of chemicals associated with stress and anxiety.

**Lamictal (Lamotrigine):** While not a supplement but a medication, Lamictal is often used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It is thought to work by reducing the release of glutamate in the brain, thereby dampening the overactive nerve impulses that can lead to seizures and mood episodes.",1690652263,jtyvnca,t3_15cowd6,t3_15cowd6,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Riprock666,"memantine can mitigate glutamate toxicity... but needs to be started super low dose (1mg) and titrated up to perhaps 5mg per day... it is super long lasting in your body (about 80 hours). I have never done more than 5mg/day and I took 2 weeks to titrate up to that... I rarely use for longer than 3-4 weeks at a time...  It will make coffee feel like amphetmine (for some people) I'm exagerating of course... but it can make stimulants more pwoerful... higher doses can give you brain fog....  dont start at 10mg... you might even get 2 days worth of brain fog from 2.5mg.  after that you will feel pleasantly confident and easily stimulated.... These effects dont always last... I'm of course primarily speaking for myself, and others may share my personal experience.. for some people it doesn't work well... like many drugs each personal experience can be a little different.",1690659991,jtzedcc,t3_15cowd6,t3_15cowd6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

VillageInevitable,"Im pleased you posted this (not that you are suffering) I'm on this same path if investigating excess glutamate.

I've suffered from anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, brain fog and ADHD since a very young age. Most recently, i have developed Fibromyalgia, poor working memory. And I think a lot of my issues are linked in some way with excess glutamate. Along with the known issuse that high glutamate causes such as anxiety, ocd, adhad and fibromyalgia I have a couple of additional items to add to the mix  :

- Alcohol: lot my symptoms go away when drinking alcohol, due to glutamate suppression and increased gaba. Paradoxically, the symptoms come come back 10 fold during glutamate rebound, sometimes causing panic attacks.... I can no longer drink alcohol 

- Diet Glutamate/Glutamine rich foods (MSG, Bone broth, etc) and inhibitors. These seem to trigger me mentally. I remember consuming a load of l-Glutamine and then having near psychosis, similar with bone broth

Megatron_McLargeHuge,"The glutamate excitotoxicity hypothesis in neurological disorders isn't about global glutamate levels. The idea is weakened neurons are more susceptible to spikes in extracellular glutamate.

This is a well established process in ischemia, but more hypothetical in chronic diseases. It's the motivation for trying NMDAr antagonists in AD.",1690732276,ju332jp,t3_15cowd6,t1_jtxk1fw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
