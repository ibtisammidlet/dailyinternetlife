SunDevil329,">Can you link me some good supps with alpha GPC/Hyperzine A etc which is tested and for a reasonable price.

Since no one wants to say it, I will... no, I can't. For two rather significant reasons:

1. With all due respect, while I am sympathetic to what you're dealing with, I'm not going to do your research and product selection for you

2. There are no good supps with those two substances, as they're not particularly good substances

Alpha-GPC has cardiovascular concerns with long term use (I believe it's related to TMAO? Going off memory, so that could be way off) and is generally inferior to CDP-Choline for choline supplementation.

I'm not overly familiar with Hup A, as it's a fairly strong acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Not something really desirable for most people.",1690522454,jtrn8gp,t3_15awnxr,t3_15awnxr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
VillageInevitable,"These basic questions are regularly answered. 

It litrally takes 5 seconds to Google ""ADHD r/nootopics"" or ""adhd nootropics and supplements for focus reddit""  and see the results, much quicker than posting the same already answered questions

Once you've done your research and got some insight, then this is a good place to get some follow-up dialogue",1691242438,juw9ciw,t3_15awnxr,t3_15awnxr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jeannnnnnnnnn,Alpha-gpc seems to be more benificially impactful than cdp-choline for me,1693920208,jz8asjg,t3_15awnxr,t1_jtrn8gp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
