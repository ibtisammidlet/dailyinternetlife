Several-Yellow-2315,"sarcosine and nac have some research behind them in terms of treating schizophrenia in particular. i personally take sarcosine in order to prevent any induced schizophrenia effects due to smoking weed once or twice a week or so. i’ve had my dna tests done and although, i’m not predisposed to schizophrenia, i don’t want to induce anything that may not be concurrent at the moment as i deeply care for my mental health and well being. it seems to be a more potent option compared to the likes of d-serine and has some evidence to support its better efficacy and so forth. feel free to look into it. hope the information below helps. will be linking some research papers down below:

“This first short-term treatment study on NMDA receptor−enhancing agents suggests that sarcosine, superior to D-serine, can benefit not only patients with long-term stable disease but also acutely ill persons with schizophrenia. This finding indicates that a glycine transporter 1 inhibitor may be more efficacious than NMDA-glycine site agonists for adjuvant treatment of schizophrenia, at least during the acute phase. Further studies are needed.”

,"I think you can look into the NMDA front. He could try maybe glycine or sarcosine or something else with similar action but you gotta do research into it obv, don’t go in blind. I think glycine interacts with clozapine specifically and not the other meds and if you do too high of a dose of glycine for long periods of time isolated it might be too much ammonia, they don’t really talk about that in the studies. In the studies done on high dose glycine for periods of 1.5 months they report no side effects other than nausea sometimes, some studies say the effects last some say they don’t. Just throwing this as it could be safe to try and experiment with, at least glycine because it’s a nutrient. But even that you gotta look into the details when doing high doses etc.",1690498837,jtqb2um,t3_15bbzqx,t3_15bbzqx,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
