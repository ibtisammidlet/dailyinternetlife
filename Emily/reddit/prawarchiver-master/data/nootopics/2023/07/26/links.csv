With the right stack you can do amazing things for other disorders and problems. A good stack can beat the pharma status quo every time. I have not seen much talk about schizophrenia. I'm aware that neboglamine is classified as an antipsychotic, but being non-dopaminergic in nature I would be surprised if it is effective as a replacement for dopaminergic antipsychotics in the case of schizophrenia management (maybe it is a candidate, though?).

I'm wondering if there's anything that might be able to do any of the following:
- Augment a classical antipsychotic and allow dose reduction
- Reduce cognitive/creativity impairment from classical antipsychotics
- Reduce the risk of dopamine-related motor disorders
- Replace a classical antipsychotic

I think this is the only place worth asking this question. I would not trust r nootropics on this matter, they have no clue what they're talking about 90% of the time and would suggest something dumb.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Everychem nootropics for schizophrenia, or reducing antipsychotic side effects",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15bbzqx/everychem_nootropics_for_schizophrenia_or/

I have ADHD and have not found a single drug that can help, so tried Thesis so I didn't have to figure out stacking. Add to that that I'm in perimenopause and am having a bit of a rough time, even with HRT help.

Tried their ""logic"" and holy cats... this sh!t calms me down like nobody's business. It's almost disturbing how calm I am on this stuff. Anyone have any idea which of these ingredients is bringing the chill and if there's anything dangerous about it? Because when I DON'T take this stuff, I'm extra agitated, and that's also disturbing. I am in \*serious\* need of this effect right now due to a lot of life factors.
