Since Neboglamine is a PAM of the glycine site, while Agmatine is a NAM of the polyamine site, they do not act on the same part of the receptor. Remember that NMDA receptors are composed of multiple subunits: (two NR1's and then 2-3 NR2 subunits most of the time).  The glycine site exists on NR1 subunits, while the polyamine site exists on NR2A/B subunits. Modulating these have different effects and are not at all necessarily counter to each other.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, modulators have varying affinity to different types of a given subunit. That, combined with the fact that sub-unit types are distributed more or less in different brain regions, adds even more complexity to the picture. It is safe to say, though, that the mere fact that one is a PAM and one is a NAM does not entail counterproductive effects in the brain.",1690505304,jtqpvb1,t3_15bae6x,t3_15bae6x,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
