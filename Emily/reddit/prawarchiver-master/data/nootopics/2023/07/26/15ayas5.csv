Lanky_Extension_7021,"Hey, I'll throw some information out there because I think I know what you're referring to  - Serine is used in folate metabolism and is beneficial in improving the ratio in the same way supplementing MTFL does (especially if supplementing folinic acid). Serine excess is metabolized to Glycine and can be used by your body to reduce homocysteine by using B6 to make Cystathionine. 

Glycine has been referred to as Ray Peat as an anti-estrogenic substance due to it's inhibitory effect on estrogens ""stimulatory"" nature. It does raise Growth Hormone and inhibits lipolysis which is also anti-estrogenic/anti-excitatory. In simple terms - If you or anyone supplements TMG/DMG, methylated B-vitamins, phosphatidylcholine, SAM-e, or creatine which increase methyl load - Glycine is what your body uses along with Choline to backlog those excess methyl groups. The side-effect of SAM-e are balanced with Glycine. 

Ideally one wants to supplement Creatine to spare their body needing to make it - it optimizes and reduces stress on your metabolism. Combining Serine with it will make you need half the amount to of Creatine. Once you start to feel too ""energized"" from this combo + MTFL/mb12 is when you add Glycine and Choline to balance it out. 

Personally, I don't think Glycine or Serine will be effective in reference to hormones - I think minerals like Iodine, Selenium, Boron, Potassium, and certain B-Vitamins will be effective. If you search ""Iodine Estrodiol Peat forum"" in google for example there's a few threads talking about Iodine and selenium being anti-estrogenic. I would be interested though, if you found Glycine/Serine did help! 

Hope you found some of this useful!

""Glycine’s inhibitory effects appear to oppose estrogen’s actions generally, in sensory and motor nerves, in regulating angiogenesis, and in modulating the cytokines and “chemokines” that are involved in so many inflammatory and degenerative diseases, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins. Exposure to estrogen early in life can affect the health in adulthood, and so can an early deficiency of glycine."" - Peat",1690584652,jtvaytb,t3_15ayas5,t3_15ayas5,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SandyBad,make a post here about this. such a comment would be a waste without reusing it,1690585908,jtvdxh4,t3_15ayas5,t1_jtvaytb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SandyBad,"I've been using B2 I think as a way to handle methylation issues I would get with creatine, so glycine as a solution is great to know.  

as for hormones, someone said it would first (3000mg of serine and 2000mg of glycine) reduce cortisol and then estridol. Is that true? 
They also said to stop if estridol was lowered too much. If I'm taking other stuff that boost test, maybe this is a way to stop estrogen from becoming too much",1690586192,jtvelbp,t3_15ayas5,t1_jtvaytb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lanky_Extension_7021,"Hey, thanks, I've been in a long streak of drug use and haven't devoted myself to figuring this stuff out in a definite manner, but at some point in the near future I will be compiling everything I've learned into a guidebook that people can look to for every little roadblock on the way to healing, with a full understanding of how everything connects. 

My eye is on the big picture and if there was a good step-by-step book on healing our metabolism it would save people a lot of trouble looking for answers in forums. I know it would have saved me a lot of time and life! 

My answer is lengthy and obsessive (and very autistic) but I know someone will stumble across it while looking for their own answers.",1691550235,jve6ahp,t3_15ayas5,t1_jtvdxh4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Lanky_Extension_7021,"Yeah B2 works really well for certain people, me included. Didn't stop peeing it out till I was taking Iodine, Selenium, Molybdenum, Magnesium then it slowly stopped after adding more. Do you feel the glycine works well with the B2, have you tried it yet?

The cortisol and glycine I think was a personal reaction or how they interpreted it possibly because that's ""what it felt like"". For example - glycine raises serotonin and therefore by raising that it lowers cortisol. It also allows your body to turn glutamate into the tripeptide Glutathione, your master antioxidant (made from Glutamate, Glycine, Cysteine). This creates calming, anti-OCD, anti-anxiety feelings by lowering our glutamate (look up high glutamate symptoms, could be mistaken for high estrogen.)

""Moreover, glycine significantly increased the serum 17β-estradiol levels reduced by ovariectomy. Glycine has an estrogen-like osteoprotective effect in menopause models. Therefore, we suggest that glycine may be useful for the treatment of menopause."" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26563333/ 

And 

""200 mg of glycine significantly elevated serum LH levels at 20 and 50 min and serum E2 levels at 50 and 80 min after intraperitoneal injection.""

Although Glycine does show estrogen modulation activity, I think for the most part it increases it by the fact that it increases Osteogenesis. Serine I also can't find information on in terms of estrogen. Haidut a trusted member of Peat forum thinks that Glycine possibly has anti-estrogenic effects by raising estrogen enough in plasma to downregulate receptors long term. I am not an expert on this by any means so I'd make your own virdict.
