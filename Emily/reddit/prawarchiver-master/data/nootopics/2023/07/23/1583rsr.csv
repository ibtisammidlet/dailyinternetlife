lambjenkemead,Been on tak for close to a year now and have done 3 intermittent NSI thirty day cycles. They work great together in my experience. No negative interactions at all. Some people get overly emotional on NSI so just watch out for that. Overall a great combo,1690194553,jt8dsg0,t3_1583rsr,t3_1583rsr,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

NootropicLoves,"we don't know, but hippocampus does things with emotions and NSI... grows it? does something to it. NSI personally just makes me feel weird and more bad, but allegedly it depends on the current situation you're in as it intensities emotions. so I don't really mess with it. 

plus it tastes bad",1690238682,jtb7mmb,t3_1583rsr,t1_jt9ycr0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Not at all. Only issue I hear on tak is it doesn’t mix well with THC and mane you dissociative a bit,1690323445,jtg0r9i,t3_1583rsr,t1_jtcqysb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

NootropicLoves,"did it get on your tongue at all? the formal might have changed but God the taste is bad, maybe taste if different for us. I would say it's like a really bad tasting olive oil",1690280785,jtd7sea,t3_1583rsr,t1_jtcc503,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
