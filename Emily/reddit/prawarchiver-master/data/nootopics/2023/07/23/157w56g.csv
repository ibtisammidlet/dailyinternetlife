labratdream,"Cyclazodone literally is a class above pharmaceutical grade methylphenidate or street amphetamine I've tested. It also beats every other singular research chemical, medicine or nootropic even potent stims like morphodrol, zylofuramine, Diet-fencamfamine as well as racetams like sunifiram, fasoracetam, coluracetam, phenylpiracetam, pramiracetam and the most popular ones.

The only similar compound in terms of potency and intensity of effects is meth but it lacks the profound cognitive and motivational effects of cyclazodone which is also less cardiotoxic. 


The only better thing than cyclazodone is a combination of cyclazodone and low-dose acid which is risky but unbelieveable combination.",1690922544,jue5nf8,t3_157w56g,t3_157w56g,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Better_Cupcakes,"PS. I also have ADHD and ASD (both professionally diagnosed). I don't tolerate stims or non-stimulant ADHD meds very well so it's down to nootropics for me as well.

I found that bromantane spray obviously helps but subjectively it doesn't feel sustainable- it makes me feel worse than baseline if I use it several days in a row, so I limit myself to once every 3-4 days, and then cycle off after 5-6 weeks.

I also recently found that 50-100mg caffeine + 500 L-tyrosine + 350mg mucuna pruriens + 300 mg enxtra (alpinia galanga) helps too, is long-acting (easily 8-10 hours) and feels more sustainable if not used every day. It achieves similar effects to standard ADHD stims, minus the jitters. Given that mucuna is drastically better studied than bromantane, I would (somewhat controversially) consider it as a good option for cycling. I would still not use it on the daily like some people do, to avoid downregulating dopamine produciton.",1690163248,jt73ngw,t3_157w56g,t1_jt72ez6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Better_Cupcakes,"Yeah, seconding NAC (I take it without glycine though). It's not exactly in the ""massive improvement in mental clarity"" category, but it makes me feel less swollen, and improves my baseline this way. I'm a big fan of Sinatrol from Orthomolecular, which contains 700mg of NAC plus a nice collection of herbs. I occasionally use off it-label as a not-very-stimulating pick-me-up (it's normally meant for upper respiratory infections).",1690167269,jt7be0i,t3_157w56g,t1_jt796ed,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
