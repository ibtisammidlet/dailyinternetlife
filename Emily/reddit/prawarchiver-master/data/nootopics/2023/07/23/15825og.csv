,MK-677 actually releases GH through the ghrelin receptor which is independent from the actions of GHRH.,1690214520,jt9id4h,t3_15825og,t3_15825og,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jeannnnnnnnnn,"Either fasoracetam or Nefiracetam, maybe both, upregulate GABA receptors. I'd look into that as they are more specific.

Be sure you want to upregulate GABA tho, it isn't something that always benefits your mood or cognition. I thought I needed it for my mood, but GABA just tends to make me sleepy/tired in a way that leaves me depressed.

GABA can be good, lower GABA can be good as well
