Efik_Pail,"Hello sir.
Where are you from? Bromantane can be sketchy in some countries, where this may be a prescription drug, but some websites sell it in the US. (Everychem for example)

I'm very surprised with Sulbutiamine! In France it is very cheap and sold in pharmacy without prescription (under the name of Arcalion). It's very safe but quite mild.

If you can, you may try in priority Bromantane, Phenylpiracetam, Noopept and Semax, 4 interesting and safe compounds.

Please be careful with Kratom...quite addictive, it seems. (Never tried it)",1690122041,jt4h84i,t3_157anef,t3_157anef,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

labratdream,"Did they switched off google today ? Most stuff at the top are stims sold by one of US rc/nootropic vendors as research chemicals with restricted availability only avaiable after vendor approval . This vendor used to sell cyclazodone now he has withdrawn it from market since few months. But the cyclazodone is unique unlike other stims with noticeable cognitive enhancing effects which in high doses are profound and overwhelming if one is responder to this substance.

Low hanging fruit is morphodrol it is basically like ritalin and shares similar mode of action with it. It is safer than other stims I mentioned except PPAP which is a unique dopamine release enhancer differeing from typical releasers by acting upon dopamine release only under activation not just flooding intersynaptic spaces with dopamine by dumping  all dopamine stored in synaptic vesicles like in case of amphetamine or partially in case of cyclazodone.",1690154876,jt6mdrw,t3_157anef,t1_jt6ktjg,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"I know quite well Sulbutiamine and I've read about it.
 I often take it for about 20 days when I need some help for asthenia (400-600mg a day).


I did not want to be negative about Sulbutiamine, I was just surprised that I could be forbidden to buy it in your country. It's just as absurd that to forbid something like Ginseng or Fish Oil: it works, it's not over-powerful and it's safe.

From my experience: it can be a bit stimulating during 2 days if you are very depleted in B1. Then stimulation goes away, bit it still helps against fatigue and gives you a slight boost in mood (slightly dopaminergic).

It's not amazing, it is subtle but efficient. it's not as potent as something like Phenylpiracetam, Modafinil or things like that which are stilulants: if your are very tired it won't do miracles,  but it helps to focus and do more things if you feel a little down.
I had to be checked, but it seems good to pair it with a good source of Choline like Alpha GPC.

I would compare it with Rhodiola on the mood lifting and anti-fatigue aspect (don't get me wrong: they don't work the same way at al, they don't acticate the same path in the brain, i just want to show they are both quite mild but good and efficient).

It has to be cycled, though: take 15 or 20 days on and at least a week off, or you won't feel it anymore.",1690155689,jt6o32q,t3_157anef,t1_jt6lc4y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
