Hi there,

I am really interested in the effects of Selegiline. How would you describe its antidepressant effects? Does it give you energy, drive, motivation, pleasure? And what does it do for executive functioning (memory, attention, concentration, reasoning, mental operations)?

As far as I know one of its metabolites is amphetamine, so does it feel similar adderall or vyvanse?

I would really love to hear some experience reports",False,t5_4aoxhu,Has Anyone Tried Selegiline?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/158f7to/has_anyone_tried_selegiline/

I found fasoracetam years ago after quitting being on dextroamphetamine spansul and then later Vyvanse for about 17 years, starting when I was eleven. I was diagnosed ADHD, but wouldn't get an autism diagnosis until much later. I've used anaracetam and especially fasoracetam in the ten years since I stopped my CNS meds, and they worked very well for me. but I see that those substances are no longer available. I was wondering about alternatives? I'd rather not contend with some of the problems I faced with using CNS meds, but I'm hitting a period of my life where I'm reconsidering a low dose to help contend with executive dysfunction, inattentive ADHD, Difficulty with focus and starting/completing tasks. Any suggestions would be helpful. I don't know much about nootropics, but was turned onto racetams by a friend who was way into it. They worked for me so I just used those when I hit spots like I'm currently in where I needed some extra help with my conditions.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Alternatives for ADHD/ASD?

Are there any OTCs that are legal in California that are not in other states or in EU/Europe for example?

First, what about Kratom? Can you get that there in shops?

Then I always wanted to try sulbutiamine, memantine, bromantane, sarcosine, etifoxine, emoxypine, racetams. All these are not permitted in the country I live in (EU).

Any others worth to mention for the time I am there? I want to try out many things there that I never had the possibility to try out here as ime more of these are permitted in USA than in EU (see alone Nootropics Depot).",False,t5_4aoxhu,California: Best legal Noots/OTCs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/157anef/california_best_legal_nootsotcs/
