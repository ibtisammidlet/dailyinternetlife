sugarfreeweeed,"yes i was prescribed emsam (transdermal selegiline patches) for depression for a couple months. it had a mild stimulatory effect, but gave me brain fog, hypertension, and anxiety. it’s okay, especially if you’re trying to detox from a stimulant addiction in the acute phase. but like others said, it will downregulate your dopamine system, just at a much lower rate than more dangerous dopaminergics, and i found the withdrawals to be practically non existent. that being said, it also increases the likelihood of psychosis and mania. bromantane, istradefylline, and piracetam with alcar + cdp choline + potassium chloride is a much more ideal way to increase dopamine long term without concern of tolerance, withdrawal, downregulation, or dopaminergic toxicity. also intaking enough protein and getting enough exercise and vitamins/sunlight will help a lot as well.",1690309324,jtf0psi,t3_158f7to,t3_158f7to,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Stay away unless you are absolutely desperate. It can down regulate your entire dopaminergic system in a similar manner as stimulants. If you are using it as a step down off of those drugs then great but it’s not a valid long term solution.,1690217797,jt9qvt2,t3_158f7to,t3_158f7to,-6,False,t5_4aoxhu
caffeinehell,"But then what for anhedonia? MAOIs like selegiline are one of the few things that has potential to help. Although ive heard parnate is better

All other meds outside MAOIs like SSRI/SNRI can cause anhedonia. Wellbutrin is not dopaminergic enough. And yea.

Tried bromantane already did nothing. Also tried ket

Selegiline is potentially neuroprotective, I dont think its comparable to stimulants. Plus if selegiline does this then basically you are saying all MAOIs do this (other MAOIs hit MAOA in addition to B).",1690222448,jta2i43,t3_158f7to,t1_jt9qvt2,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,Everyone has to answer that for themselves. My first question would be: have you employed every possible behavioral and psychological intervention? It’s a complex problem that requires a multifaceted approach. The psychological component in particular is vastly underestimated. Gabor Mate has spoken on this quite eloquently. I would just say what you’re probably intuiting on your own which is selegeline “might” offer a brief reprieve but that reprieve will come with a cost.,1690231339,jtapej1,t3_158f7to,t1_jta3psu,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
