Currently using three sprays of bromantane nasal spray since last Monday.
Before this i was a daily user of vyvanse 30mg for adhd .

Using the bromantane to upregulate dopamine after vyvanse use .
with 1g tyrosine and 500mg ALCAR. 

Gotta say im impressed . Obv not as “ strong “ as vyvanse , but been experiencing minimal crash and decent focus considering.

Also anhedonia improved and enjoy things better than when i was on vyvanse.

Question is , how long can i run the bromantane for before taking a break ? 
Also will bromantane have a withdrawl ?

thanks",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane time on,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/15di0yz/bromantane_time_on/
