labratdream,"Bromantane upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase which probably is a reason it reverses stim tolerance or synergizes with dat inhibitors or dopamine releasing agents however the full pharmacological profile is unknown. 

In my case bromantane was one of stims which triggered my first and very frightening episode of tachycardia probably due to interaction with selegeline which is mao-b which I stopped few days before using bromantane.

Also the effects in my case were mild and short-lasting.",1690920203,judza32,t3_15di0yz,t3_15di0yz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

labratdream,"It probably upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase which is rate limiting step in conversion of tyrosine to l-dopa a direct dopamine precursor.
There are other compounds with similar properties like cordycepin from cordyceps mushroom, aspirin, ibuprofen. There is also adamantine used in Parkinson disease to reduce l-dopa/carbidopa doses in case their usage causes dyskinesia. One is mode of action of adamantine is tyrosine hydroxylase upregulation.

BTW stim tolerance reversal is much complicated especially ehen abused because they damage cardiovascular system in body as well well in brain which in severe cases are impossible to reverse but can be partially prevented by using certain hard reduction methods. 

Beside it there is a problem of mitochondrial damage due to excessive oxidative stress and metabolic cellular waste accumulation like advanced glycation end products.

 It is also worth to mention stims emulate fight or flight response basically they cause psychological and physiological stress and either mobilization of the body to fight or run away. This includes heightened immune response which may lead to gliosis and autoimmune response due to overactivation of immune cells and antibodies production. 

Beside the problems above cellular expression of certain proteins or signaling molecules may be over the normal levels and cause shift of neurons into permanent excitation state which is impossible to be maintained all the time which leads to depletation of metabolic reserves, inability of cellular waste removal and paradoxically in the end neuronal underexcitation which leads to symptoms of constant tiredness, sleepiness and brain fog. One of such signaling molecules is c-fos which is especially overexpressed in addicts and attributed in mechanism of addiction development to stims. 

These problems must be mitigated from the very beginning of using stims before they will cause life-long irreversible damage.

There are also other negative mechanism not mentioned here.",1690921570,jue310s,t3_15di0yz,t1_ju3158i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

dunno if agmatine is mentioned but ive been ysing it at night for

2. neuroprotective
3 for drug withdrawls ( klonopin) to balance glutamate / gaba durinf taper and to help nerve pain during taper .",1690893411,juc2g4l,t3_15di0yz,t1_jub6uaz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
paulm19855,theyve included memantine as a tool to lower tolerence but as far as im aware its an nmda antagonist like agnatine so that should serve the same purpose,1690894035,juc3qug,t3_15di0yz,t1_jub6uaz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
