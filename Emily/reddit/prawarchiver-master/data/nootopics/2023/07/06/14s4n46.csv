Maybe go to r/supplements",1688970180,jrdfb1a,t3_14s4n46,t3_14s4n46,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Zukons,"They decrease DHT, not Testosterone.

The side effects that a reported 3% to 15% of men experience from 5-ARIs is due to lower DHT.",1688693996,jqyx6kr,t3_14s4n46,t1_jqw1zra,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SurfaceThought,I think you're thinking of Astaxanthin? Neither of these are listed as 5-ar inhibitors on the wiki page,1688672998,jqxk06i,t3_14s4n46,t1_jqwvha2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
user344542_12,"I am considering lowering the dose, but the pills I have available are all 20mg Lutein. However, if I am not misunderstanding Lutein has a biological half life of many days, therefore I might as well just skip taking it some days and go for optimizing a weekly dose rather than daily.",1689059561,jriau8z,t3_14s4n46,t1_jqyx6kr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"They all inhibit 5ar which leads to lower production of androgens. DHT, test, etc. And Lutein lowers test by other mechanisms as well.",1688673992,jqxmlke,t3_14s4n46,t1_jqxlkg8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

user344542_12,"I have now started to take Lutein 20mg daily only (stopping the 2mg Zeaxanthin), to check if/how this changes anything. 

Do you have anymore input on how Lutein lowers T by other mechanisms? I cannot find much about it, but I did find some sources claiming some of the Zeaxanthin may be converted to Astaxanthin in the body, which is a known 5-ar inhibitor (therefore I figured to stop with Zeaxanthin).",1689059336,jriak5w,t3_14s4n46,t1_jqxmlke,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
