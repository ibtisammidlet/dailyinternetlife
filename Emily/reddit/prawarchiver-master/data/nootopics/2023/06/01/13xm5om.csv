Try oregano oil, food grade, a couple drops in 1/2 glass of water and see if it gives you clarity. Don’t overuse long term though. Gives me instant clarity.

Silly_Magician6841,"Try to find a way to upregulate dopamine, b complex has the important b6 p5p, this is the magnesium of the B vitamins, aids in many processes, indeed upregulates dopamine, just need to be careful with the dosage no more than the 100%rdi it has long half life and it builds slow neurotoxicity, main clue is feeling needle like pain in your extremities, some people just don't get neurotoxicity at all even at high dosages 100mg per day, it's genetics I guess,

Phenidates can help you in the short term at least , 
Isopropylphenidate is a pure dopamine reuptake inhibitor, no adrenergic side effects 
It solves 50% of adhd, gives laser focus but not the adrenergic push like ritalin or 4fmph, 
Many people combine isopropylphenidate with coffee just to get that ""push""  from caffeine, 

You can try dopamine precursors to upregulate your dopamine like L-tyrosine, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, 
Potential issue with the precursors is the rate limited conversion to L dopa, if your epigenetics don't produce enough tyrosine hydroxylase, no matter how much precursors you take, your fate won't change, 

The solution to the conversion problem appears to be Bromantane and anecdotally Matcha Tea, or any kind of camellia sinensis tea that contains high amount of EGCG's
