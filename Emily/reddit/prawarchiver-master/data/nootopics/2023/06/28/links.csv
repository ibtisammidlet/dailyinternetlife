Made me stop taking it and consider eating eggs instead. Unfortunately the other Choline sups have similar or other problematic tendencies. Does one know other alternatives then eating eggs? Would be helpful for any vegan or people that are no chad raw egg gulpers.

Any links that might tell me so far are private and not letting me in. Anything else is a lot of back and forth good and bad experiences. I assumed there must be at least 1 go to vendor for people but doesn't seem to be the case?

Not so much looking for supplements but for the medicational noots. Have plenty of supplements already. Things like racetams, memantine, bromantine,  Sunifiram, obviously modafinil and the other related derivatives, even the more experimental meds. etc. etc. etc.  Is what I am looking for at this point.

I'm trying to get off Adderall and onto Modafinil (with strattera, already started strat). But long term Adderall/Dexedrine use has down regulated the heck out of my brain and screwed up my endocrine system so there is a process of repair while transitioning. Definitely dependent on amphetamine but not addicted.  I say that because I have no addiction withdrawal symptoms. Don't feel sick, zero cravings for amp, no parkinsons like shaking etc. Just tired, unfocussed, unmotivated, and grump. Didn't take amp for a week and only did  to be functional enough to be on the net for more than 10 minutes.

Problem is, the stuff I purchased from umbrellalabs did squat for me (aside from the worst rash I've ever had in my life. So Idra-21 may be legit LOL). Don't have prior experience so can't say for sure if I am just so downregulated that Phenylpiracetam (300mg), Sunifiram (30mg), Noopept, and Fladrafinil (200mg) are like placebos except for mild  Tachycardia.  I expected at least some waking affect from Fladrafinil considering they prescribe modafinil to meth-heads in rehab to help with withdrawal symptoms. I'm not even close to meth-head damage so would expect some bump in the minimum from Fladrafinil. Mounjaro could mess with those things if they are basic ph and can be effected by stomach acid  but haven't tried looking up that info yet. Mounjaro delays stomach emptying and is ionizing my adderall and greatly reducing absorption on an empty stomach. Tried those others with and without food. Not all at the same time obviously. And didn't jump to those mg doses I mentioned right away. Just end up taking naps while listening to my heartbeat in the pillow all day.

Do have 9-Me-BC from umbrellalabs I haven't tried. Basically the list of foods you shouldn't eat while on it is basically my list of foods I eat daily so some adjustment is needed first.

I'm in the U.S. so that may be a factor. Don't have crypto so some reasonably unconvoluted way for credit card or zelle is necessary.

Losing over $500 a day trying to transition off Adderall since I can't work. Software engineer so all brain all day. 

I did get some stuff from cosmicnootropic. Been taking memantine for a week. Piracetams are good for increasing heart rate but did nothing else for me, even double dosing. Have a couple other things from them I haven't tried yet. (side note, their free shipping sucks, pay the extra 6 bucks for USPS)

Just to be clear, not expecting to transition meds overnight. Takes a long time to undo down regulation and neurotoxic damage and may never get back to my old baseline. But I should be getting at least a response from meds that I can then work with as I transition. Took 6 months without supplements after being on adderall for 1.5 years the last time. Now 15 years later back on and way farther down the rabbit hole. And yes tried getting help from shrinks already with no success. Unfortunately I know more about adderall than most of them now.  Shrinks 0 for 4 in trying changes. Me 2 for 2 in what I suggested may help. Similar results from endocrinologist, and know more than most of them do about Amp effects on endocrine systems. Which is really annoying when I need them to run blood tests for me and prescribe my meds.
