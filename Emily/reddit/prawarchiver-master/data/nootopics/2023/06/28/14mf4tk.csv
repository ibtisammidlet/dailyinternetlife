sirsadalot,"From the makers of the top (snoot): ""Hi - the plastic tops are made from HDPE, High Density Polyethylene. There is a stainless steel spring and ball bearing inside the pump mechanism as well. We’ve tested out over 60 manufacturers of nasal sprayer tops, and these are the best ones we’ve found.""

I've let one bottle sit out for nearly an entire year in solution and there was no visible degradation. Not that that's normal... I'm selling out every 5 seconds it feels like.

I tried googling caprylic acid and HDPE, didn't find many results. So, what are you basing this off of exactly?

Also simply googling ""High Density Polyethylene"" displays countless examples of translucent HDPE products, such as cups and sheets.",1688075942,jq1vl80,t3_14mf4tk,t1_jq1ssfp,12,False,t5_4aoxhu
Better_Cupcakes,"That's helpful, thank you! 

Yeah, HDPE can be *translucent*, but typically not fully *transparent*. Medical tubing can be made out of it though, so I am assuming that's what the pumps must be using. 

The product is great and much more effective than oral route. I just wanted to make sure that it's safe to use/store long term.",1688101177,jq3bi2m,t3_14mf4tk,t1_jq1vl80,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
