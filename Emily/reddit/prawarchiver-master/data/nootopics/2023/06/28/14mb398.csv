MezDez,"Why is this bad?

What makes you think this combo is negative?

Everything is dose dependent.

ALCAR provides acetyl cofactor for ChAT.

This means, during the metabolism of choline (phosphatidylcholine, etc) choline has the potential to be ezymatically pushed towards acetyl choline, or continue the recycling path (phospholipids).

ALCAR provides that avenue. That's about it.

CDP choline provides a 12 hour+ slow release of cytidine (converts back and forth with uridine).

CDP Choline results in cytidine and choline free form in blood. Acetyl carnitine will aid in the conversion of the choline part to acetylcholine, and the cytidine would act like uridine.",1688084083,jq2e6bc,t3_14mb398,t3_14mb398,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
MrsAMPA-PAM,I take 250mg Citicoline and 500mg ALCAR (sublingual) and I think they interact synergistically  with each other. The only thing that might raise acetylcholine levels high enough to cause anxiety is ALCAR. But if you take 500mg orally you shouldn’t even be saturating your mitochondria so I don’t think that will cause an excess of choline big enough to cause anxiety. The Citicoline is also on the low end of the dosing spectrum depending on your dietary choline.,1688063096,jq0y1as,t3_14mb398,t3_14mb398,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
NotCommonCommonSense,Does ALCAR make anyone else way more aggressive then normal even with 100mg it makes me so short tempered and no other nootropics really do that,1688104643,jq3gv6g,t3_14mb398,t3_14mb398,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"No, not a bad idea at all. I take 250mg of citicoline and 500mg of ALCAR every morning. If you haven't already, I'd suggest trying the ALCAR on its own to see how it affects you. I could be mistaken, but of the two substances, I'm fairly sure ALCAR is the one that people tend to have issues with.

If you're concerned about how it may affect you, start low (500 mg) with ALCAR to assess your tolerance. Most people don't have a problem with it, but some do. If your goal is dopamine upregulation, you're on the right track.

There's a post regarding ALCAR and depression that you'll want to check out if you haven't seen it:

,"some people say 500mg of alcar is too much, but it's hard to get say 250mg economically",1688076261,jq1wcvu,t3_14mb398,t3_14mb398,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Less-Shift-398,"Alcar was a life saving supplement for me. But it's tricky . 500 mg will give me amazing boost to Start my day . But sometimes I feel tempted to up my dose to keep getting the same good effect. And when I do that I sometimes  feel like shit, confused, anxity, minor panic attack. So it's all dose dependent.
500 mg is the safe dose. More than that you are risking  panic attack. Also it affect sleep negativity so try to dose early in the day.",1688134388,jq4rq3u,t3_14mb398,t3_14mb398,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
