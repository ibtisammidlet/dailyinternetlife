YoungPeublo,"Alpha GPC + Stroke Risk?

In podcast #80 Andrew mentions that a study found an association between long term use of AlphaGPC and increased risk of stroke18.

One possible reason for this is that AlphaGPC increases blood levels of a chemical called TMAO, which itself is associated with atherosclerosis.

Itâ€™s worth noting that this study looked at a cohort in Korea taking AlphaGPC regularly for cognitive decline.

Whilst the paper doesnâ€™t specify their daily dosage, I reached out to the lead author (Gyeongsil Lee) to learn more. He said that in Korea, the typical dosage prescribed by doctors there is 400mg 3x per day, so 1,200 mg per day, every day.

So what theyâ€™re taking in a single day is roughly comparable to what Andrew might take in a week.

Andrewâ€™s approach to reduce his TMAO levels (a tip from Dr Kyle Gillett, former podcast guest), was to add 600 mg of garlic (which contains allicin) the same day as taking AlphaGPC.

His blood work showed a decrease in TMAO after he added the garlic.

EscapingQuicksilver,"I'm wondering if it may be due to excessive heavy metals in the sourced supplement? Each source differs, but overall, all supplementation has heavy metals toxins in them, which is why moderation is ideal. Depending on your body's heavy metal burden, your liver/kidneys may not be capable of filtering enough of the metals out (especially with regards to mercury or lead), resulting in the heavy metals degrading your nervous system's myelin sheath and cardiovascular health, amongst numerous other deficiencies it develops. ðŸ¤” It's definitely a growing concern I share, as I take numerous nootropics/supplements daily. Personally, I mostly take Alpha GPC after any workout.",1688083329,jq2cioy,t3_14m4un9,t3_14m4un9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
b0lfa,"Giving choline to folks whose diets cause their gut microbiota to rapidly produce TMAO makes sense that it would increase stroke risk, it's like throwing gasoline into a blazing fire.

For those of us who do not produce much TMAO at all (vegans/plant based eaters) if I recall correctly, taking choline is a non-issue.

We've already removed the most significant cause of stroke risk and CVD from our lives, and the bacteria who contribute to the TMAO production are largely absent from our system. The general population, or at least that selected population in the South Korean group on the other hand i assume is at higher risk of stroke and CVD in general than their general population, and a lot of the folks prescribed alpha GPC in the study i assume are of an age group that is already at higher risk anyway.

tl;dr - speculative, but IMO not a big deal if you are already minimizing the most significant risk factors for stroke and CVD.",1688603533,jqtuoga,t3_14m4un9,t3_14m4un9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Also important to note that:
> The mean (SD) age was 61.6 (9.4) for nonusers and 68.3 (10.0) years for users. In addition to being older, the Î±-GPC users tended to have lower household income (lowest quartile, 33.7% vs 24.1%), and more comorbidities (CCI score â‰¥2, 65.7% vs 29.5%) than nonusers in the total cohort

Yoshbyte,"This is what makes me uncertain about such studies. The concerns to my prior reading tend to line up with TMAO and gpc increasing it potentially. To this end, idk a good solution, but it is hard to say that these studies are much useful since the demographic is so disparate to the people who are younger using it as a nootropic. I personally doubt it implies risk in the long run if someone is younger and ceases at an older age regardless since if it is a TMAO thing ceasing would eventually cause a normalization. Again, itâ€™s been a while though. I do wish we actually had some studies on younger people but it isnâ€™t a viable area of research compared to the intended demographic",1688111387,jq3pxdv,t3_14m4un9,t1_jpzrhdl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
