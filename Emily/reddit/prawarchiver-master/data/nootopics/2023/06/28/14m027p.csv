Ill_Possible_7740,"So far I have used CosmicNootropics which I like. But my brain is so downregulated from Adderall I don't get any effect from mild stimulants.  But do feel like other meds are helping to fix Adderall issues faster than without them.

I have now tried Everychem and like it alot so far.  

Question though, what is the proper way to take the EveryChem products that are liquids and provided with a dropper? Is it simply a matter of dropping dose into the mouth and swallowing, should try sublingually then swallow, or mix it with something before eating? Will these liquid mixtures have a negative effect on teeth enamel?   


Bought a bunch from Umbrellalabs at first. Like I mentioned before, don't seem to do anything. Don't know if they are just being destroyed in my stomach and not absorbed or what the deal is.

I took a look at [NootropicsBase.com](https://NootropicsBase.com).  I'll stick to cosmicnootropic. They have a lot more meds to choose from. And prices are about the same or better. They don't have a few things like modafinil or armodafinil. But prices for those are much higher than other sites that sell it. They do have Atomoxet which is Atomoxetine. But it is way to expensive for the amount in each tab.

Everyone posts about various supplements and drugs and how wonderful they are at repotentiating Adderall. But so far disappointed in all of them. Stopped taking Adderall for 2 months and only take it when I need to drive. But very far from being back to pre-medication days.

Ill_Possible_7740,"I know for a fact that Mounjaro affects my Adderall. There is no doubt there. Adderall is a weak base that gets ionized by stomach acid and ionized amphetamine doesn't absorb well. One day I took Adderall and ate until I was full. It started to kick in in about 45 minutes and was much stronger for the dose than it had been. on the 5mg Mounjaro dosage I can take 80mg of Adderall IR and roll over and go back to bed for 2 hours and have some effect when I make myself get out of bed. At peak blood concentration I have some therapeutic effect but it only lasts 2 or 3 hours and not really enough to be efficient at my job. 

  
Memantine I don't feel anything from it. Just hope that it is working. Taking 10mg twice a day. Don't know if I should actually feel anything though. I only take Adderall on days that I need to drive now since I stopped taking it in June. I can get by with less but can't say how much to attribute to what drug, supplement, or just not being on it for days or weeks at a time.  Strattera I used in the past with Adderall and it repotentiated it. Only found out recently that is likely due to it being a weak NMDA receptor antagonist witch is similar to the nero-protectiveness of Memantine. But Memantine is designed for the job. It took many months for Strattera to repotentiate Adderall so don't know how long it would take Memantine to help. Only been taking it a month or so. And started back on Strattera 3 months ago. Plus take L-theanine which is also a weak agonist of the NMDA receptor.  No idea if Memantine wins or if they compete.

 Taking stuff from everychem and cosmicnootropics on top of the umbrellalabs stuff. Even the nasal sprays from everychecm I don't really feel anything. Then again, not sure if I am really supposed to feel much or if they are just working. I have the NA Selank and NA Semax and Bomantain sprays from everychem. As well as 3 liquids with dropper ones. Sometimes it feels for a couple minutes like something reached my brain but nothing beyond that. I don't really feel the stuff from cospic either except the sulbutiamine which makes me sleepy.  I do know that all the supplements and meds I am taking are helping a little since I had stopped taking Adderall before and feel like I am advancing better even though I am much more damaged from it than I was back then. But no way to tell what is working or not since there are too many to sort out.  
Didn't start nootropic supplements till after I had been on monjaro for a few months and the nootropic drugs only in the last couple months. Without any prior experience, I have nothing to compare to. vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, nootropic drugs, etc. all in all I'm taking about 50 give or take a day.   


On Jardiance alone my a1c was 6.7. Adding mounjaro my last blood test was 5.3. pre-diabetes starts at 5.7 for reference. Plus my cholesterol and triglycerides are the best they have ever been, and blood pressure the best in about 20 years. Lost and holding off 30lbs that Adderall tacked on and couldn't lose. So hard to justify getting rid of the mounjaro unfortunately. But I do need to start working again and don't know if modafinil/armodafinil will work for me or not to get off Adderall.

Ill_Possible_7740,"It's just a theory but,  
Think the issue is more than just absorption due to Mounjaro. Think it is blocking PFC signaling making the meds not work right. My theory GIP and GLP-1 analogs in drugs like Mounjaro cause an accumulation of cAMP in cells (known from drug research).  cAMP can in some cases increase neurotransmitter release. And in others ""cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, closing the brain cell to communication and thus interfering with the function of the prefrontal cortex. "" So an individual may have positive, negative, or neutral effects of Mounjaro on their psychoactive medications.  


A long shot solution for those negatively affected.  ""guanfacine works by strengthening the regulation of attention and behavior by the prefrontal cortex. These enhancing effects on prefrontal cortical functions are believed to be due to drug stimulation of post-synaptic α2A adrenoceptors on dendritic spines. cAMP-mediated opening of HCN and KCNQ channels is inhibited, which enhances prefrontal cortical synaptic connectivity and neuronal firing.""",1701046476,kawvijg,t3_14m027p,t1_juzfv79,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Ill_Possible_7740,"Fasting is very very difficult for me. I have issues with appetite control. Probably something to do with ADHD and not being able to block out stimuli. Even then, I am often hungry even when I have eaten. Fasting for just 1 day  for a medical procedure is a difficult challenge for me. Plus, I have to eat to take Strattera. Without food it makes me nauseous.  But, I do understand the benefits of fasting.   
I did buy some Spermidine which is supposed to  cause autophagy. But then I realized there is a lot of damage done and being done from Adderall, so better to try to promote repair and renew for now till I can get my brain healthy again.

Metformin, a lot of research that says it is good for you, not just for diabetes control. So, would like to take it. But it increased my blood pressure, gave me heart palpitations, diarrhea or loose stools, thing there was more but I forget. Januvia I  had issues with also.

Mental clarity for me is a year or so away. Need to get off Adderall and repair my brain. Right now just to be somewhat functional it takes 400mg modafinil, 350mg armodafinil, 100mg strattera, 60mg adderall, 200mg caffeine, plus my assortment of supplements and low dose experimental drugs .

While on Jardiance and Mounjaro, my blood glucose was better controlled than non-diabetics.  My a1c was down to 5.3.  And my glucose spikes  after meals were lower than a non-diabetic.
