Khronosgod,"Don't take the tyrosine, is overkill. Take the tyrosine maybe 6hrs after taking bromantane. If you are eating enough protein during breakfast you dont need to supplement any dopamine precursor.",1687819153,jpne2ws,t3_14jpdbd,t3_14jpdbd,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
TwoPlusTwoMakesA5,My experience with bromantane and what I’ve read from others as well is that if I do nothing I feel tired but as soon as I engage in something physically active I have seemingly endless energy.,1687813270,jpn01k2,t3_14jpdbd,t3_14jpdbd,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

dylan_0001,It’s finicky use less. I learned the hard way by thinking the dose didn’t go up my nose and over sprayed 2 each side and I felt sick like my head was split open for over a day. Now I just do one spray and it works better but you could do one each nostril but I wouldn’t go over that. It also has a longer half life so also don’t redose too soon either.,1687815417,jpn5c8j,t3_14jpdbd,t3_14jpdbd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Vye7,"Copy pasta: 

high concentration of dopamine activating D2-receptors leads to rapid activation of a D2-IPSC that is sufficient to cause a temporary pause in the firing of a VTA dopamine neuron.

excitatory D1-class receptors (D1 and D5) and inhibitory D2-class receptors (D2, D3, D4)

dankvapesta,Came across that sleepy feeling as well when I first used it. Just means your taking too much. After a while of using it you won’t have that effect.,1687826381,jpnu1sj,t3_14jpdbd,t3_14jpdbd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
IntransientHotDog,"  The effects you describe sound like higher end of therepeutic range antihistamines with the sleepiness and foggy feeling....

In my opinion, Bromantane's effects are 100% placebo... Except for the crappy side effects. 

It is in no way at all a stimulant. I think the confusion stems from the vendors that sell Bromantane also used to sell ""Prolintane"" which IS a valid psychostimulant. They started listing Bromantane shortly after they stopped selling Prolintane and lots of people thought it was a Prolintane analog replacement",1687839743,jpokc3z,t3_14jpdbd,t3_14jpdbd,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu
D2_Agonist_Master,I would go so far to say that it may not even be about the breakfast. Unless you’re starving yourself for days at times I doubt your body wouldn’t have some levels of tyrosine around from eating properly the day before.,1687832750,jpo7cw9,t3_14jpdbd,t1_jpne2ws,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
