IntransientHotDog,"Isopropylphenidate is not hard to order. It's almost identical but is a bit weaker. 40 mg IPH = 15 mg MPH.

A kg can be purchased for $600 though so it's not a problem. It is also not a controlled substance",1687840378,jpold0u,t3_14jv8bj,t3_14jv8bj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Ill_Possible_7740,"If it's for fatigue in particular then modafinil or Armodafinil can be prescribed. And are more in particular for wakefulness/fatigue than Ritalin which acts on similar neurotransmitters but primarily in different area of the brain more associated with cognitive / executive function.

i.e. you're on the wrong drug for fatigue to begin with unless you've tried the others and didn't respond well. 

Fatigue is usually a symptom and not a disorder, so, do you know the actual cause of fatigue and have addressed the source of the problem?",1687849051,jpoxp5z,t3_14jv8bj,t3_14jv8bj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
IntransientHotDog,"Modafinil is in no way a replacement for Ritalin. 
Caffeine also is a wakefulness promoter but not a substitute.

Ritalin substitutes are Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors. 
Cocaine is closer than modafinil but is also not good because too short acting, expensive, addictive, and illegal. 

If you want a replacement think along those lines... Not modafinil.

4 flouro methylphenidate is close but more potent and also more addicting 

Isopropylphenidate and propylphenidate are perfect replacements.

Ethylphenidate is as well but impossible to find for sale anymore",1687840715,jpolwcb,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpo2vyg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
2000DollarFiletOFish,I want to try moda but every place I've seen that had it was sketchy or has shut down,1687834129,jpoa4ys,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpo93r2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Potential_Low4134,Not remotely true internationally though maybe in the nation you live in. All phenidates are illegal in the UK except methylphenidate available only strictly controlled as a prescribed substance,1698070634,k63voss,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpold0u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
insaneinthecrane,modafinil is also a dopamine reuptake inhibitor though it is not it’s only mechanism of action,1687848935,jpoxjs7,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpolwcb,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Ill_Possible_7740,"People always go to dopamine first. But Norepinephrine is more associated with wakefulness. But, both are linked especially in the shared pathways and one affects the other.",1687849272,jpoxzg0,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpolwcb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tnttyler,Well than if you are ok with sourcing from obscure places I would say alcar Bromantane and istradafyline from everychem and than buy decim8  pre workout online for only special occasions because it has the exact same problems as Ritalin but is highly effective if that’s what you’re looking for,1687834568,jpoazz0,t3_14jv8bj,t1_jpoa4ys,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
