Black_Cat_Fujita,"I’m sure there are others who could describe it with much better clarity and thoroughness, but one thing that makes it unique is its ability to potentiate the activity of certain neurotransmitters. It does not act as an agonist or dump neurotransmitters into synapses. It rather just increases the amplitude of impulses already taking place. It’s my understanding that bromantane functions in a similar fashion. In the case of PPAP, it affects dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, apparently. Unpublished research has revealed it to be a stimulant which only acts when called upon by the will, as a mood booster, and as a focus enhancer.",1687734156,jpiu99o,t3_14izdl9,t1_jpiqgj1,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

stabbedbyresonance,"I used it on its own mostly. I did mix it with other things sometimes but yeah it can be abused on its own. I used to do a lot of adderall and other stimulants. Even modafinil is like coke or adderall to me. Very reinforcing. I think many people can use these things responsibly just as many can drink responsibly, but for an addict/alcoholic, I would advise against the use of stimulant-type compounds like PPAP. I think it’s very interesting and probably useful for many people, but potentially a big problem for a certain, likely small, subset of the population.",1687741918,jpj9y8z,t3_14izdl9,t1_jpj1zd7,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
