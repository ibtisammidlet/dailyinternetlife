Context: semi-daily adderal XR user. Usually 4-5 days per week. Diagnosed inattentive ADHD since young adulthood. 

I've started trying bromantane (2 sprays each side) on my days off from the rx. The first time, I felt a boost in cognition and calmness. Made me alert, but not stimulated per se. In each subsequent use, I've noticed it makes me extremely tired; I feel like I could fall asleep standing up. Brain fog x10. I do take L-Tyrosine and black pepper extract with my morning vitamins. Not sure if that has any impact, good or bad. I also use cannabis regularly, but the way I use it doesn't normally give me brain fog and fatigue. 

Has anyone else experienced this, or have any ideas what might cause it?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane makes me sleepy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14jpdbd/bromantane_makes_me_sleepy/

Itâ€™s relatively unknown but has earned a good reputation among those lucky enough to find it. Its unique pharmacology and rarity would seem to make it very much at home on the EC menu. Its mechanism is strongly analogous to bromantane (and there may even be some overlap or synergies).
