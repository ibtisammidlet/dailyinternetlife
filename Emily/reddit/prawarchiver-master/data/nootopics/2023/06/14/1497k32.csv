LetsChangeSD,"Yeah, so I did a lot of research on these to just recebtly. AMP standalone can suggest several things depending on the context... but the theme with AMP is that it is a compound that formulates various other energy-related compounds in both directions (ATP, ADP) but also AMPK an enzyme that when energy is low, is activated (or triggered) to produce energy (ATP). 

NAC is a compound known for its precursor property called glutathione. This 'hero' roams around cells and helps fight guys that became too many and formed a cult. Formally known as reactive oxygen species; you could say these guys do the opposite of healthy cell regulation. In turn, this can manifest through things biohackers tend to want to address. Such as energy, mood, focus, motivation, and the lack thereof.",1686750867,jo3q584,t3_1497k32,t3_1497k32,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Unrelated but personally after taking a acetyl l gluthanione that I think it’s cognitive effects are mediated by it’s interactions with glutamate. I say this because taking salg I don’t notice anything acute cognitive effects but In my case I’m certain that salg is a superior way to raise gluthanione levels after noticing far less negative effects after drinking specifically my liver not feeling worn out the next day at all as opposed to nac where it’s a little helpful for a hang over.
But I don’t find salg to have a nootropic effect I would say it has a benificial effect. Meaning to me nac works nootropically independent of gluthanione.



That’s my experience 

I’m also curious if the op meant ampa because there is evidence of an relationship there.",1686762448,jo4gsxt,t3_1497k32,t3_1497k32,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Rozeu,"My question comes from a comment on reddit that I didn't get an enlightenment.

The comment refers to “amp activity” and from the context I deduced that it meant cAMP.  But maybe it could be AMPA.  

Can you explain the relationship between NAC and AMPA?",1686763878,jo4k98g,t3_1497k32,t1_jo4gsxt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Rozeu,AMP as Cyclic AMP or cAMP. Sorry for the confusion.,1686762404,jo4gp4i,t3_1497k32,t1_jo3pab9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"[link to ampa nac relationship in depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22327021/)


There’s one case. A good way to learn about these things is to Google things like “nac ampa” or “nac camp” that’s how I found that study. It works for most things just the nootropic and then the receptor or function you’re interested in 
And usually if it’s been studied you’ll find information.",1686765099,jo4n7ed,t3_1497k32,t1_jo4k98g,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
