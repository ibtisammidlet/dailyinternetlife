But I recently quit nicotine cold turkey. And I'm two weeks clean now. I'm cool with the cravings, I fight to concentrate on work but I can mostly force myself most of the time. The problem is that I can't sleep and I get constant headaches.

The sleep is one thing because even magnesium glycinate which used to do wonders for my sleep right before I quit stopped working. I tried adding in some glycine, melatonin and no noticeable improvements, this is been going on for about 5 days now. I feel sleepy or tired throughout the day except nootropics are in effect, but when I eventually crash, it only lasts about an hour or two at most.

The second thing is the constant headaches. I've had headaches before and they feel different depending on what might be wrong. I've mostly been acquainted with choline overload or deficit headaches I think and this feels just the same. Just a dull constant ache that sometimes has pulses of sharp pain with waves of increasing intensity depending on how much physical movement l'm succumbing my head to or stimulation im exposing my eyes or ears to.

I've noticed if I supplement with cholinergics the headache reduces for a while. But that doesn't last very long.

I guess my question is how does this work really? And what can I do besides waiting it out. Are these headaches because my brain somehow got used to the choline I was feeding it through nicotine, and now it's finding it hard to produce it's own?

Should I even be supplementing with choline if that's the case?

Any information would be helpful. I'd just like to understand what's happening and anything that could help me through the process would be most appreciated.

Oh I guess it's worth to mention my source of nicotine was through vapes.

Update: 
Just wanted to say my sincere thanks to everyone that helped.  I feel much much better now. 

What helped? This stack every morning:
Rhodiola rosea 
Nac every morning and when I felt headaches come in. It definitely helped with cravings too. 
L-tyrosine 
Phosphatidylserine 

Let me add I worked out every morning and had to fight through only getting 2 hours of sleep every night for about 3-4 weeks. Staying active definitely helped keep my mind off the cravings as well. 

I noticed I have to be more sensitive to my environment to get enough sleep these days, even when I’m extremely tired. Low temperature, low light and low sound environment, else it’ll just be disturbed. If I had to describe it I’d say I slept like a log anytime I wanted before, now I sleep like a guard dog, awake with the slightest movement.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Constant headaches that feel like low choline or too much during nicotine withdrawals,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14iqyi1/constant_headaches_that_feel_like_low_choline_or/

Nothing worked.

I‘m looking for a possible herb/supp that might be an alternative for my treatment-resistant condition. Found two already:

- Bacopa enhances my memory
- Gotu Kola stabilizes my mood/anxiety
- looking for other helpful assistants, so please name your favs :)

What are others that have a profoundly significant and noticeable effect on you?

Very interested in: ALCAR, SAM-e, 5-HTP, Tongkat Ali, Skullcap, Magnolia Bark, Lemon Balm, Mulungu, Ginseng, Curcumin/Turmeric, Apigenin, Lions Mane, Saffron, Wild Lettuce, Akuamma, Ginseng, Polygala, Cordyceps.

1. What's your experience with it? What do you take it for, what effects do you get (mood/depression, anxiety, sociability/talkativeness, energy/drive, stress/relaxation, cognition, sleep etc.). 

2. At what dose and what brand/product?

3. Does it work used only on occasion / if needed? I mean must it be taken daily so it builds up in your system until it can and does work (similar as antidepressants)? Or is it something that works right away and can be felt after first time dosing?
