mikorbu,"I’d give Paradise Herbs Rhodiola extract a shot— it’s one of the very few that has *both* rosavins and salidrosides, and raises serotonin and catecholamines in balanced amounts.

It also raises function of acetylcholine (and has acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects), endorphins, NMDA/glutamate modulation, and acts as an adaptogen to restore proper HPA, energy, and cognition after addiction— all of which are basically the mortal enemy of nicotine withdrawal.

[To top it off, just found out it also modulates nicotinic receptor function, and helps prevent both desire and reinstatement of use](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264566/) which makes even more sense for why it’s worked so brilliantly for me and anyone willing that I’ve thrown it at for quitting lmao.

Final part would just be some NAC to restore proper function of glutamate antiporters (which nicotine/addiction derange) to prevent relapse and demolish cravings— all while cleaning up the lungs and restoring lost glutathione from chronic smoking.

Best of luck friend— 2 weeks in and you’ll seriously wonder how smoking ever seemed like a fair trade for how fantastic you feel :)",1687732764,jpirc91,t3_14iqyi1,t3_14iqyi1,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Start cerobrolysin and donepezil, then alpha gpc, uridine and piracetam. The gist of the video is that you need more choline and neuroplasticity to easily quit vaping/smoking. 

Gonna try this myself some time in the future, in the meantime I'm still vaping but slowly lowering my nicotine. Was on 10mg nicsalts 3 months ago and I'm now vaping on 6mg and 4.5mg base nicotine.",1687713306,jphjd74,t3_14iqyi1,t3_14iqyi1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Time-Fix-4158,"Thanks a lot! I was using the Rhodiola from double wood and it helped with energy, I’m not sure it helped with much else. I’ll definitely give Paradise Herbs a try. And how could I forget NAC. It’s just beautiful, really. I can’t believe I didn’t mention it in my post but it’s hands down what has helped me the most so far.",1687733102,jpis1t7,t3_14iqyi1,t1_jpirc91,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Isaiah61,How have you been taking NAC? I have some sitting around but I'm not sure when/how to take it.,1687842858,jpop5ul,t3_14iqyi1,t1_jpis1t7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Time-Fix-4158,"When I wake up 4-5 times a week. 500 mg. 
Sometimes I take it when I need it - splitting headaches or an itch in my throat that feels like the oncoming of an allergy or cold. Works wonders dude!",1689425995,js27jpu,t3_14iqyi1,t1_jpop5ul,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
