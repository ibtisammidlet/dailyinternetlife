expanding_crystal,"I was doing 5-HTP for a while, and it works, but I do not recommend for long term. It starts to unbalance your other neurotransmitters. I went down a rabbit hole of trying to add other stuff to balance it out but ultimately it was too much work and I need my brain to function every day. I stopped about a month ago and will probably not re-try it.

Tongkat Ali, I like. I take it daily. Enhances energy and maybe mood a tiny bit. Increases libido and sexual performance as well.

Have you looked at Ashwagandha? That’s my #1 for controlling anxiety. Works well, no long term negatives that I can tell. I’ve been taking it for more than a year. 

Magnesium is also good for lowering anxiety. Magnesium L-threonate is the most bioavailable I’ve found and works well. Helps with muscle cramping too.

My new anti-anxiety helper that I’m still excited about is Mexidol. You can buy it on Amazon. Works well for anxiety and has other systemic anti-inflammatory effects. No downside yet that I can tell. 

For cognitive boost/maintenance, I like lion’s mane mushrooms, L-theanine, and a tiny bit of cdp-choline a few times a week. I’ve also been trying out NMN nicotinamide the past few days and things seems a little “brighter”. Still in experimental phase with that one.",1687706630,jph48bk,t3_14in1ex,t3_14in1ex,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
