Psychological-Park48,Look into tropisetron. It works on the nicotine receptors but isn't addictive like nicotine. It has many nootropic benefits.,1688271520,jqcesdy,t3_14nq9d6,t3_14nq9d6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

joshharvey02,"Ok that's very interesting and anecdotes are still useful to me. I've never smoked + I'm sure the extra chemicals and carcinogens present in cigarettes make it slightly different to something like Nicorette. 

While I agree with the aim of not being dependant on it, I would argue 90% of western civilisation are dependant on caffeine but because it isn't viewed as harmful people don't see an issue. Nicotine is neuroprotective which I find particularly fascinating considering how it is viewed by wider society. 

I use caffeine every day to help my productivity and would certainly be less productive without it, and I view nicotine in a similar way at this point. I don't plan on smoking/vaping so the main concern people have with nicotine causing harm is removed hence I'm finding it hard to find issue with using nicotine.",1688203793,jq8p2dn,t3_14nq9d6,t1_jq8oltf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
