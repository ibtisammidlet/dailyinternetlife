dylan_0001,I agree but I like to use noots as shortcuts to things like that when I’m in an environment I feel like I can’t relax in. The end goal is to certainly not need the help from anything and be far into meditation.,1688253067,jqbgsjl,t3_14nh388,t1_jqa6d74,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

D2_Agonist_Master,It’s just something I’ve noticed a while after I started taking it. Sometimes when I’m drifting to sleep if I imagine something it’s like to the point where I visually see it. Pretty rad. Memory calling also has been really great,1688182789,jq7wsb4,t3_14nh388,t1_jq7tif4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Agitated_Internet354,"Incorrect. It can be strengthened insofar as the ""muscle"" exists. In your case you probably can. However, some people do not have that specific ""muscle"" at all. Like trying to curl your tongue in a way it doesn't bend for you. Nothing happens. People with aphantasia get by fine, but they don't exist as a result of a lack of trying to visualize.",1688187755,jq84ouv,t3_14nh388,t1_jq7t7d0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

DoggoChann,All you need to do is distract yourself into your mind last time I did it there was a ton of noise around me. Focus on creating imagery or if you can’t even do that even one color.

dylan_0001,"Not a muscle that atrophied. If someone is born naturally skinny it doesn’t mean their muscles atrophied or they were born completely without them. It just means they have to work twice as hard to look like the person genetically predisposed to being muscular. Everyone is born different but it does not mean we are born completely missing what others have. Maybe it was a poor analogy to grasp but if one person is capable then so is everyone else. As different as we are, we are all the same. You are only incapable when you believe yourself to be because you bought into the idea of something like aphantasia when you struggled at what came easy to others. Give someone with aphantasia a psychedelic and tell me they see absolutely nothing at all. Have someone with aphantasia really practice deep meditation and tell me they saw nothing in all of their practice because I guarantee they did to both which means they aren’t born without the ability it’s there and just has to be practiced.",1688197522,jq8ho3z,t3_14nh388,t1_jq7uvcj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

D2_Agonist_Master,"There certainly can be. But honestly from mine and other people’s experiences that I’ve read, we barely get any side effects at all. All that I experienced was a slight increased sensitivity to getting sunburnt but that was about it. Obviously it numbs your mouth a bit if you do it sublingually but I got used to it after a few days and had no taste loss.

As far as MAOi side effects- absolutely 0. I’m still eating just as I did before with absolutely no trouble.

I would watch out for supplementing with methyl donors while taking it though.",1688221209,jq9g6z2,t3_14nh388,t1_jq8hzop,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

dylan_0001,"So I watched and read a little bit and find some conflicting things like one person that said 

“5ht3 antagonism causes constipation. NMDA antagonism causes psychosis. Nicotinic 7 receptor antagonism inhibits nearly all forms of cognition involved in learningLastly, there's a possibility of addiction in some individuals. Just take a break from stimulants don't rely on memantine” 

I also find some people say it works good for them and some people say it makes them feel worse and that it is also a dissociative sort of like low dose ketamine. Idk lots of conflicting stuff.",1688255106,jqbkzqq,t3_14nh388,t1_jq7uve3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

D2_Agonist_Master,"Yes, it is an MAOi, albeit a reversible one. It’s pretty potent on MAO-A but fairly weak on MAO-B. Read up on the compound itself as well as on MAOis, I’m sure you’ll find it interesting. I can’t find the post right now that talked about it in detail, but avoiding supplementation of methyl donors should in theory eliminate 9mebc’s metabolism into a neurotoxin.",1688270836,jqcdpn7,t3_14nh388,t1_jqccqqu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
