Now these are statements and findings of i dont know which year, so maybe there is someone here knowing more about the legal status of Pregnenolone in EU countries (I live in Austria so if one knows that or how I can find that out, it'd be great).",False,t5_4aoxhu,Legal status of Pregnenolone (in EU)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14mharg/legal_status_of_pregnenolone_in_eu/
