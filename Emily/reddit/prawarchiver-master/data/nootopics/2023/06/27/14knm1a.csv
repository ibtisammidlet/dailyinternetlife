Black_Cat_Fujita,"Spraying technique is absolutely critical to deliver a consistent dose. And dosing consistently is crucial for getting the desired effect. It‚Äôs possible to waste most of the bromantane. It can run out the nose or run down the throat (where the much smaller amounts used intra-nasally will have negligible oral effect). And since much smaller quantities are necessary to get the same effects intra-nasally, one spray too many can mean getting way too much bromantane absorbed. Either way, too little leads to no effect, and too much leads to side effects. I suspect at least some of the negative reports from intra-nasal use actually relate to faulty technique. People just need to be aware that using this sprayer can really be tricky, but it can be done. It is necessary to prime the sprayer and it is sometimes wasteful to do so, but think of how much you are saving compared to taking it orally. And it can be a pain to lean your head back and roll it around in order to get the oily mist to adhere to the sinuses. But once you get the technique down, it‚Äôs easy. A little patience and research goes a long way. I think it‚Äôs worth it. It saves money and is a much more effective ROA for me (and many others) than oral.",1688441422,jql9urj,t3_14knm1a,t3_14knm1a,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"I'd be far less concerned about the three noted, ""one off"" adverse events (AEs) than the countless positive anecdotes regarding IN bromantane were I considering giving it a try. While it's always a good idea to use caution when exploring new substances, I feel that you're giving far too much weight to anecdotes.

I've learned from personal experience (and via repeated advice) to perform as much independent research on new/unknown substances as possible. Then, after I have some understanding of how ""x"" substance is supposed to work and what it *may* do for me, I take anecdotes into account.

Keep in mind that in most cases (I'm guessing, but I'd be shocked were I wrong), people are not taking these substances in isolation (they'll usually specify if that's the case). We also have no idea what other medical and/or psychiatric issues people may have going on. Not saying they're worthless, but possibly of questionable value, all things considered.

Sometimes this works the other way around, wherein certain anecdotes will pique my curiosity and/or interest. That said, independent research is a necessity regardless. If you're not familiar with how to read the basics of a medical study, I'd get familiar (there's a pinned post in this sub that should give you a starting point).

Edit: for the record, I use IN bromantane daily. Typically 3-6 sprays, but it varies. No significant side effects, but I do feel a bit more tired / fatigued than normal when it wears off; if I have the time, I'll dose 2x a day. This can present as sleepiness sometimes, though poor sleep schedule is equally at fault.

Helps with wakefulness, physical/cognitive fatigue, more confident in general. These effects are subtle, but they are present. They're more prominent when you first start using it.",1687908031,jpsd7ea,t3_14knm1a,t1_jprosxn,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
