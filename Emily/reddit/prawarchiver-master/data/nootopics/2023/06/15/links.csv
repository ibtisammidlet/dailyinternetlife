I am currently taking 20 mg of Prozac daily and am very interested in experimenting with TAK-653. I apologize if this question has been answered already. Since TAK-653 is an AMPAR potentiator with minimal agonism and Prozac is a 5-HT2B receptor agonist, are there any interaction possibilities I'm not aware of? Any oversite would be appreciated",False,t5_4aoxhu,TAK-653 possible interactions with SSRIs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14b0bo7/tak653_possible_interactions_with_ssris/

Do any of these cause an increase in resting heart rate or blood pressure? Have you experienced any negative health markers while taking any of these or a combination?
