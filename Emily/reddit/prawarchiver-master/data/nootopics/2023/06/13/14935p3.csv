,"I’ve also had great experiences with J147. 

For me it really seemed to quiet down the noises in my head and let me focus. 

Used it during a very depressive time and felt it helped me get back on track. Only reason I stopped was because I felt it was impacting my sleep but I plan to go back and run it solo to see if that is the case.",1686750322,jo3p0h4,t3_14935p3,t3_14935p3,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"Yeah I totally understand that for me it really quiets down the thinking of something is too hard or things like “I don’t need to do that now I’ll do it later” i still don’t really feel like running errands but I just say okay I’ll do it.

And to get the more profound effects like I had socially the alcohol was a key factor, or phenibut and other things that help me deal with social situations. Also bromantane helps too to magnify the enjoyment, and generally ads a little complimentary boost.

What was your dosage? I range from 35 mg to 100 mg in two doses daily but I found 35 and 10-15 to be about right.",1686761519,jo4ekod,t3_14935p3,t1_jo3p0h4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Yeah I did, it’s something that unless stacked is really mild actually made me need a nap at first so think if it has been tried it’s been dismissed.so to get the bang for your buck id stack it with something maybe proglutamatergic or otherwise mentally stimulating I actually don’t notice many pro cognitive effects as far as focus etc and try it before like going to a movie or something it may enhance the experience.
On top of that it just is plain healthy for your brain lol",1686742581,jo3ba8s,t3_14935p3,t1_jo38mfy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"My dosage on J-147 would range from 30-45mg just once in the morning. 

I’ve tried Bromantane and I just can’t sleep no matter what dosage I try. However, that was also mixed with caffeine, now that I’ve basically given up caffeine I may try some lower doses of Bro to see if I still have the sleep problem.",1687271421,jou2b99,t3_14935p3,t1_jo4ekod,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,Nothing perceptible but it’s not all that perceptible in the first place. There was a post on longecity from a person who had really good anti depressant effects that said he got some lasting effects for a few days iirc but there’s no withdrawal sense for me either it might just be dependent on circumstance,1691035519,jukpysl,t3_14935p3,t1_juccwdz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
