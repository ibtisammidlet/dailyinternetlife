harry_lawson,I have some 2mg Nicorettes and I hate them. Give me a weird itchy sensation in my mouth and throat and make me feel wired. Not worth the addiction imo.,1686664720,jnzsy1e,t3_148fc7y,t3_148fc7y,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Maestroland,"It is a shame about the addiction but I have, in the past, really appreciated nicotine as delivered when smoking a cigarette. Nicotine is one of the best things to have to make you focus. It is great when you are under lots of pressure and really have to produce.

Now that I don't live in Berlin any more and reside in the US where smoking cigarettes is taboo, it is no longer part of my life. Probably for the best.

I was never addicted. It would take me 2 weeks to get through a pack and then I would always wait 2 weeks before buying the next.",1686701670,jo1s4yy,t3_148fc7y,t3_148fc7y,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

I was vaping, using it when I was either tired, stressed, or just felt like I needed to be sharper... Then I tried to quit, and my god, yeah, it was like 2 weeks of hell! Lol was very easily agitated; felt horrible, weak, almost like I was dying; and got SUPER angry... At EVERYTHING! and I'm not one to get angry easily either.

It's quite the rush as well.

And I'm still just trying to get off the regular nicotine...it is the most addicting substance. The hape is different though..I and many others I'm sure have experienced being nic sick. I got it the worst from vaping",1686733224,jo301ef,t3_148fc7y,t3_148fc7y,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
verysatisfiedredditr,"I'm not sure if its worth it, but if you really want to try it, get Swedish snus.  If youre in the US you can find General brand at retail stores.  After that its really cost effective to order it from Europe.  You'll have to take them out after a few minutes, they are really strong.

I've used nicotine off and on for twelve years and its not hard to quit, half of its just psychological.  Wellbutrin or Bromantane/Tropisetron make it easy.  The B/T combo might actually be preferable to nicotine.  I have gone cold turkey off of 8 snus a day with no issues.

Patches or snus actually enhance dreaming, you actually have more willpower/control in the dream.

I've never liked straight nicotine products, this might be due to the harmala alkaloids in tobacco.

Weird thing I noticed is that 80s European rally drivers smoked in between stages. They wouldve known about snus.  Maybe they were just on speed, but I have a theory that there are cognitive benefits to chasing dopamine which nic primes you for.  That is a total broscience pet theory though, maybe someone can chime in.",1686667622,jnzy6y6,t3_148fc7y,t3_148fc7y,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,Eh nicotine is a wildly double edged sword. Is one of the more powerful nootropics? Yes. Is it incredibly addicting? Absolutely. Is it good for certain aspects of long term health?

skytouching,"In my opinion reports of it being some game changer are predetermined by reading it’s a game changer else where.
I’m not say it doesn’t work and I talk about people responding differently to everything but to think of it generally speaking as an effective nootropic is hyperbole.
I think it’s possible that a very low dose patch maybe even half of that patch for someone without a history of nicotine use be useful in a stack as a potentiator to something else.",1686749642,jo3nn13,t3_148fc7y,t3_148fc7y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

wetliikeimbook,"The addiction is more insidious than any other in the world in my opinion. I’ve tried so many substances and have never had an addiction to any other like I do with nicotine. The issue is how severely it compromises your baseline in between use and long term if you decide to quit. It does that severely but also more subconsciously than other things if that makes sense. It’s like you can’t quite put your finger on it but then when you use nicotine again an hour later, a day later, a month later you feel more like yourself. I’ve quit for two years, for six months, for periods of weeks and I’ve had to accept that I will never be as functional and happy without it as I am with it. So here I am with this terribly annoying addiction for the rest of my life and it bothers me just the principle of it. There are so many cognitive enhancers out there that aren’t extremely addicting and my advice is to stay very far away unless you are absurdly desperate.",1686686396,jo0zevu,t3_148fc7y,t1_jo0yrcd,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
