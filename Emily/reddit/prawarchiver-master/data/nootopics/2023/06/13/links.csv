And in my opinion I’m glad I gave it a shot.

I’m situationally very depressed in a apathetic not sad way and have some anchedonia that I believe is related to it On it’s own it was okay I noticed slight improvement in my mental health. But one night I got myself to go hang out at the bar with my best friend. It was a good night I had fun I got pretty drunk but the next morning even though I had a hangover and wanted to lay around all day but I was actually happy not just not depressed. I was chatting my mouth off all day I was laughing out loud at party down and bought a ticket to skrillex at red rocks something I’d normally talk to myself about worries about not having fun or various other anxieties and other similar neurotic thinking about why I shouldn’t or couldn’t do it.
The effect faded and it still it takes a bit of self motivation to do things like go out to dinner and stuff but when I do it removes the anhedonic response and amplifies the gratitude for  those simple things. 
My musical perception is heightened and appreciation.
I don’t believe it’s or even mainly a bdnf driven necessarily a bdnf driven effect. It seems like it’s involvement with the 5ht1ar has a lot to do with it there’s a change in thinking and slight reduction in inhibitions to do things I don’t want to that feels serotergic without the sort ofblah feelings of a ssri. There’s some rational to support a dopamine dishibition theory via 5ht1ar agonism. Flibanserin (a drug I really would like to try. Even though it has some 5ht2 and subtype antagonism may work similarly. I will also note it’s not like mirtazapine which is effective but lacks the sort of sense of well-being that j147 can have.

It takes work and possibly stacking with phenibut bromantane and other nootropics. But it’s reminded me life can get better.
Ithere are not a whole lot of discussion or experience reports and it’s been around for quite a bit and I think it may be under appreciated.
Also I’m going to busy through the weekend so I may not reply to all questions.",False,t5_4aoxhu,J147 is the can be the most impactful nootropic I’ve ever taken,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14935p3/j147_is_the_can_be_the_most_impactful_nootropic/

My sleep has been destroyed, and I feel like a shell of my old self. I was using Semax previously and now it makes me feel even worse. From what I see online Emoxypine can help inflammation because of its properties as an antioxidant. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have a lot of Emoxypine around and I’m considering trying it to help my symptoms. 

Unfortunately due to this lame “lockout” (or whatever they’re calling it) all previously posted info on Emoxypine on the OG nootropics sub is gone. Any info would be appreciated, I’d dig more but using screens is a big trigger for my symptoms.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Emoxypine for post concussion syndrome?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/148vxpt/emoxypine_for_post_concussion_syndrome/

I have always been warned to avoid it because of its addictive properties. 

With that being said and understanding the warnings I have several questions for folks who use nicotine pouches, gums, or patches.

1 - How do I dose it? I find myself to be most effective before 2pm.

2 - How late can one take it without it affecting sleep? 

3 - How do I control my intake without experiencing withdrawal symptoms or a need to up the dose?

4 - What other nootropics do you couple it with to boost efficacy?
