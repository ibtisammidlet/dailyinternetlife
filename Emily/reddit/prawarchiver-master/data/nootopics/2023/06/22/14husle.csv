Vye7,Digital disimpaction prob your best bet,1687632335,jpdmxit,t3_14husle,t3_14husle,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheMostStableGenius,Itâ€™s primarily a 5-ht3a antagonist I think so find one that isnâ€™t,1687652180,jpes013,t3_14husle,t3_14husle,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,There's a dose discrepancy for sure. Gts 21 is also an a7 partial agonist but its side effects are even worse because it causes nausea,1687625206,jpd6twb,t3_14husle,t3_14husle,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

stabbedbyresonance,"I always have great and regular poops. only when I take Tropisetron itâ€™s like my bowels just stop moving. I feel like I need to go but canâ€™t make. I havenâ€™t specifically tried to increase fluids and fiber when taking trop, no, but I drink a lot of water and eat a salad and other veggies most days so I feel like Iâ€™m covered?",1687655569,jpey8tj,t3_14husle,t1_jpejrm3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Yeah Iâ€™m doing it once a week right now. Itâ€™s more sustainable. Might try twice a week.,1687707007,jph52oi,t3_14husle,t1_jpfxt49,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

I kid",1687632567,jpdng7x,t3_14husle,t1_jpdnatf,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheMostStableGenius,For sure. A related 5-ht3 drug Odansetron gives me similar problems,1687656496,jpezwi2,t3_14husle,t1_jpexv1t,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Some a4b2 partial agonists because they weren't addictive and improved cognition in healthy people, however the synthesis projects didn't pan out because it was too costly to create them",1687697340,jpglrzu,t3_14husle,t1_jpdn7ts,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita,"Yeah me too, but goddam I get ginormous turds which a a little painful but satisfying to pass. Yeah.  I know TMI.",1687655850,jpeyqke,t3_14husle,t1_jpey8tj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita, Thought of a possible solution. Lower the dose of the tropisetron to mitigate the 5-HT3 antagonism. Then add a low dose of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (like huperzine) to boost the nicotinic agonist effect. Or am I oversimplifying?,1687832702,jpo7990,t3_14husle,t1_jpey8tj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,Let us know.,1687714275,jphlkc5,t3_14husle,t1_jph52oi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Just have to enema everyday now ðŸ¥²,1687643767,jpeben8,t3_14husle,t1_jpdng7x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,"Seems like it could work. It would depend on if ACh/choline and Tropisetron bind to the same site on the receptor. Trop is a pretty strong poop-stopper for me though so dropping the dose might not help. I usually take 10mg and tried 5mg and it still made me constipated, Iâ€™ll try 2.5 and see what happens.",1687881504,jpqhlwq,t3_14husle,t1_jpo7990,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,So when I take 2.5-5mg it seems to mitigate the constipation,1689293848,jrvfqw1,t3_14husle,t1_jphlkc5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita,"I got backed up before even going above 5 mg. Besides trying  with huperzine, I might try lowering to 2.5 and combining with an HACU enhancer like coluracetam (pramiracetam might work if that works). If no",1687882706,jpqkmic,t3_14husle,t1_jpqhlwq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,Aha. Dose dependent. Do you still get a cognitive boost at that lower dose?,1689339091,jrxghe5,t3_14husle,t1_jrvfqw1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Cool try it out and report back. It looks as if nefiracetam has activity at a4b2 and maybe weakly at a7 nAChRs so it might potentiate Tropisetron.,1687893538,jprcv7y,t3_14husle,t1_jpqkmic,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,So when I take 2.5-5mg it seems to mitigate the constipation. I get better effects from 10mg but more constipation too unfortunately,1689293912,jrvfvwa,t3_14husle,t1_jpqkmic,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Yeah but not as much as 10mg. Itâ€™s more subtle. I prefer the higher dose but you canâ€™t have everything in life.,1689608471,jsbxy6s,t3_14husle,t1_jrxghe5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita,Good point. That one has the perfect profile for a stacker (on paper at least).,1687895451,jprhs1r,t3_14husle,t1_jprcv7y,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita,"I tried spreading the dose out throughout the day (3 x 2.5) and taking a moderate does of Huperzine A (100 mcg). No constipation, but I could tell it would still help with diarrhea if that makes any sense.",1689367812,jrzfjyu,t3_14husle,t1_jrvfvwa,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Black_Cat_Fujita,Found and interesting prospect for a stacking companion for the tropisetron: cytisine. It's a partial nicotinic agonist that's used for tapering off tobacco. It's used mainly in Europe. I ordered some of the Polish version off of Amazon.,1690820084,ju7x3qi,t3_14husle,t1_jsbxqkv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
