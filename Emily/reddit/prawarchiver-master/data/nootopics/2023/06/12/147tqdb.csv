•Despite adequate treatment, residual symptoms is a major problem in patients with psychosis.  
  
•Unmada, described in Ayurveda is equivalent to psychosis and related disorders.  
  
•Management of Unmada described in Ayurveda could be a suitable add-on treatment for psychosis.  
  
•There is a need for neurobiologically informed research in the management of psychotic disorders using Ayurvedic approaches.  
  
  
Abstract  
Background  
Despite advancements in the treatment of psychosis, many patients continue to experience persistent symptoms and relapses during antipsychotic treatment, particularly when they fail to adhere to prescribed medications. Ayurveda explains psychotic disorders as “Unmada” and describes various treatment protocols. Although these therapies and methods have been in practice for several years, systematic evidence has not been generated for the same. Thus, in the current review an attempt has been made to illustrate currently available clinical trials on Ayurveda management of psychosis.  
  
Methods  
We identified 23 studies by literature search in PubMed Central, Cochrane Library and AYUSH Research portal. Out of these, 21 were retrieved after systematic deduplication. After excluding nine studies, 12 studies were included for review.  
  
Results  
Total of 12 articles comprising 10 clinical trials and 2 case reports were reviewed. Most of the studies demonstrated significant improvement in psychopathology assessed through various symptom rating scales.  
  
Discussion  
The role of Ayurveda, in the treatment of psychosis is least explored. Currently available studies on the effect of Ayurveda treatment on psychosis are very less in number to draw a valuable conclusion. Hence there is a large scope for conducting neurobiologically informed clinical research in the management of psychotic disorders using Ayurvedic approaches.",1686593863,jnwx295,t3_147tqdb,t3_147tqdb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Have you read any of the studies? I’m not saying that the theory of the article is wrong but I looked at all of them and they are extremely vague or not producing any evidence of spe routes of research that to find more effective treatments because the articles are so vague.
I’m not saying you’re wrong but the evidence provided isn’t extremely convincing. Improvement in symptoms doesn’t mean improvement in treatment. There is no comparison or in combination to other drugs etc.. 
That’s my personal take.",1686769141,jo4wzxs,t3_147tqdb,t3_147tqdb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
