Totum_Dependeat,Piracetam is pretty subtle and probably wouldn't mess with your sleep. I would save it for early morning or afternoon though just to be sure.,1686674429,jo0bfkt,t3_148b9ym,t3_148b9ym,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Rozeu,"Thank you for your reply.

It is advised to divide the daily dose of piracetam into three sub-doses throughout the day.  

In that case, wouldn't taking piracetam in the first half of the day be a bit too short?  It would correspond to a dose every 2h30 more or less.",1686747990,jo3kg3z,t3_148b9ym,t1_jo3b1y8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

For example, the standard Piracetam dosage is 800mg / three times a day, which is 2400 mg in total. I'd split the daily dose in the following manner: 9am, 12pm, 3pm either way",1686751954,jo3sgab,t3_148b9ym,t1_jo3kg3z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
