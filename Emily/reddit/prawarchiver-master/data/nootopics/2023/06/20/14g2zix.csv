oldmate-onyabike,"Ive been taking d-serine recently as its supposed to have a rapid antidepressant effect with acute dosage via the exact same mechanism as ketamine. Thats what the studies say.
But as usual, it doesnt do shit, just like every other supplement/nootropic ive gotten my hopes up about.
D-serine is basically the same as sarcosine, i was going to test sarcosine first but the studies indicate d-serine is superior.
In conclusion: nothing works. Only pharmas work, and half the time they dont either. Depression is harder to cure than brain cancer.",1687439501,jp36xac,t3_14g2zix,t3_14g2zix,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
