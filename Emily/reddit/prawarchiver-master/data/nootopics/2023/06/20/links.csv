And truth be told, there is very little on the subject. But, it's known that sweet scents can negatively impact career success and attractiveness:  [https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.123](https://sci-hub.se/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.123), and as one of our primary senses, it's inevitable that it will have an effect.

There's a lot of pheromone products, but most are seriously underdosed, and not matching clinical trials. Additionally Androstadienone has the most evidence, so that's what I decided to go with. 

Androstadienone was shown in clinical trials to make people appear more attractive: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26827295/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26827295/), [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18601928/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18601928/), and increase men's success with women: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987372/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987372/). It's otherwise a metabolite of testosterone, which is likely why it's correlated with living a better life: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280082](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280082). Androstadienone has no smell to it, thankfully, because many pheromones smell like sweat.

Iso E Super is the only scent I found that was rated as objectively pleasant. In addition to that, it also decreased the perception of bad odors: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223005547](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223005547). People claim it increases the projection of fragrances, however I have seen no real proof of this.

Caveats:

Iso E Super is a one dimensional smell. Somewhat like a spice, or woody note. One might not find it suitable alone as a fragrance, however the goal of this product was objectivity. Perhaps it could be added to another fragrance to yield greater results. 

Androstadienone has both a study that shows it decreases cooperation between men: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29390162/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29390162/), and increases: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062499](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062499). While either could be the case (or neither), it's worth noting that the positive study outweighed the negative one both in change from baseline and overall methodology.

I do not recommend spraying Iso E Super/ Ethanol point blank on your clothes, better to mist it from at least a foot away.",False,t5_4aoxhu,The first fragrance listed to everychem.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/14gasel/the_first_fragrance_listed_to_everychemcom/
