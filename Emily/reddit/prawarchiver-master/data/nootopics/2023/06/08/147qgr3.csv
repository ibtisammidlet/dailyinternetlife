Turbulent_Zone_5324,"I relate to this so much.

Guanfacine and (not with) Propranolol are the only pharmaceuticals that’ve worked for me in reducing sympathetic overstimulation from Amphetamines. Not by the mechanism you’ve described above though.

I’ve come to the conclusion it’s best to search for alternatives regarding stimulants, rather than patching up a problem, caused by another problem. But Dextro-Amphetamine + Guanfacine is for sure a great combo. Not optimal for longevity, obviously.",1686590534,jnwqjns,t3_147qgr3,t3_147qgr3,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Merry-Lane,"Here is what happens when you have too much adrenaline :

Sympathetic hyperactivation  

Hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is not a recognized condition in itself, but it is a component of a number of conditions, as well as a possible consequence of taking sympathomimetic drugs. It causes a distinctive set of symptoms including aches and pains, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, headache, paleness, and a drop in blood glucose. If sympathetic activity is elevated for an extended time, it can cause weight loss and other stress-related body changes.

The Wikipedia part about adhd and noradrenaline says:

ADHD  

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a psychiatric condition involving problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.[60] It is most commonly treated using stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), whose primary effect is to increase dopamine levels in the brain, but drugs in this group also generally increase brain levels of norepinephrine, and it has been difficult to determine whether these actions are involved in their clinical value. There is also substantial evidence that many people with ADHD show biomarkers involving altered norepinephrine processing.[61] Several drugs whose primary effects are on norepinephrine, including guanfacine, clonidine, and atomoxetine, have been tried as treatments for ADHD, and found to have effects comparable to those of stimulants.

Long story short, yes, you can have noradrenaline issues with adhd meds, but it s really likely you don’t (because you don’t mention specifically the issues above and that adhd usually benefit from noradrenaline).

What you mention is either normal (attention issues arent solved purely with meds) either you may benefit from building up your tolerance to adhd meds.

I had feelings similar to yours during my titration period, but dosages close to your « effective long term dosage » need to be adapted to. It may take weeks before you get used to it and actually ask for another small increase.

If you told me you had these symptoms altough you were taking the same dosage for months everyday and didnt drink caffeine at all, then yeah your dosage is too high and needs to be lowered.

But I doubt it and I would advocate against « hypothetizing that you have X because you feel Y and thus look after countering Z that induces X coz that it would make it better ».",1686590762,jnwr00m,t3_147qgr3,t3_147qgr3,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

I’ve damaged dopamine and NA through med abuse, and it’s the NA that helps me focus more when I increase it. 

This sounds more like an anxiety problem, lowering NA might help short term, but really want you want (I’m the same) is to lower activation of the HPA axis and default mode network. 

Mindfulness for 10 mins box breathing and focusing on body can really help. 

I found myself to be over stimulated in the DFM, so lowering that is what helps more then anything.

Guanfacine is an a2A agonist, promoting the best that NE can offer (this is my interpretation of the paper).

I usually use propranolol for specific situations where I have to speak in public. With great success (with the exception of sweating hands, but this could perhaps be solved by increasing the dose).

Rozeu,"Does L-Theanine have this ability to reverse norepinephrine into dopamine?

I read a [study](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cpb1958/34/7/34_7_3053/_article) on mice that stated that:

* L-theanine actually reduced the levels of norepinephrine;
* But when L-Theanine was combined with caffeine, norepinephrine levels rose more than the control group.

I know that NA plays a very important role in ADHD.

But for some reason in my case I must pass the threshold of desirable. Or maybe my body overreacts to NA.

This difficulty in concentrating used to happen with ADHD meds, and it happens to me now when I combine caffeine/NALT. At the same time, I have to squint, as if I have tunnel vision. So I want to test this theory and try to block Norepinephrine production.

On the other hand, this [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15205875/) says that excess norepinephrine can impair the cognitive functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which play a key role in ADHD.

""Modest levels of NE engage postsynaptic a2A-adrenergic receptors and strengthen working memory"".

""In contrast, higt levels of NE released during stress impair PFC cognitive function""

WouldYouCalmDown,"I am obligated to fix your error regardless how old this thread is because it spreads tremendously false claims. 

- First
L-Theanine does not convert norepinephrine to dopamine. That's biologically impossible. Norepinephrine is made from the break down of Dopamine. L-Theanine's main mechanism is aiding in the conversion of glutamate to gaba

- Second
Not all people with ADHD are the same as you, meaning they all don't benefit from more norepinephrine. Norepinephrine helps the brain attain focus, but acetylcholine is what allows the brain to maintain focus for long periods of time.

- Third
Lowering activation of the HPA axis is not ever recommend because it causes a lot of issues, including reducing the body's ability to handle and regulate stress. Remember it's a whole system involving 3 separation brain structures. It's generally never the case that all of them are overactive and normally that one part is distegulated. The term lowering is the wrong word, and what should replace it is balancing your HPA axis.

- Fourth
NAC while does convert excess glutamate to glutathione, also lowers dopamine. Taking it daily for extended periods of time will cause worsening in ADHD symptoms. There are plenty of people that can attest to that on here as well.

- Proponet

mikorbu,"Can’t say much on propranolol, but adding Guanfacine to my Dexedrine (low dose for ADHD-PI) not only got rid of the scattered focus and peripheral tension/side-effects, but also allowed me to use an even lower dose after about a week in.

Didn’t seem to make much sense considering it’s MOA, but from what I remember digging up it seems that Guanfacine also improves PFC function and restores proper mGlur and AMPA signaling— which is usually aberrant in ADHD brains.

I actually juggle around between a couple adjuncts, using either L-Theanine, Apigenin (personal favorite) or when cycling off the Dexedrine (to maintain efficacy and prevent dopamine receptor and TH downregulation) I add NAC 1-2 hours after the morning dose on top of the usual nightcap to knock out any residual amp activity before bed.

Ill_Possible_7740,"Don't get hung up on Norepinephrine = fight or flight response. That is just a generalization. Dopamine and norepinephrine work together often. Some pathways are combined meaning they work on both at the same time. And if I recall correctly, your mental model of dopamine gets made first then gets turned into NE is wrong. They don't come from the same pool of dopamine. Even in cells that work on both NE and dopamine, the vesicle that holds the NE produces dopamine and turns it into NE. THe vesicle for Dopamine produces its own dopamine. So preventing NE does not mean more dopamine left over. NE is critical for focus and attention etc.  working with dopamine. (same is true for epinephrine vesicles. It makes dopamine ->converts to NE->converts to epinephrine without affecting the dopamine and NE vesicles that may be in the same cell)  And to be honest, this is just a generalization because some vesicles store more than one neurotransmitter. But production is not typically from the same pool of one to be used and to make another.

I recall reading that ADHD inattentive type tends to have a higher deficit in NE than dopamine and the opposite for primarily hyperactive types. I can't say the accuracy though since I hadn't fully vetted the source and checked for others to confirm it. But I can say the brain is probably 100 or a 1000 times more complex than any of us on here think it is so guessing based on generalizations about it will be a difficult path to follow. There are processes, counter processes, feedback loops, and tons more things going on.   


I really really really don't like when people talk about the overstimulation wearing off as you get used to it.  Reason being is it is not a matter of getting used to it. What that really is, is building tolerance and down regulating your brain.  For many people it turns out to be no big deal. But for many others it is the beginning of a down hill slope to ""why doesn't this work any more"". Or in my case why do I have anhedonia, why doesn't this work any more, why did adderall destroy my endocrine system hormone balances, etc. Even, worse but I'll spare you the details. Another way to put it is ""getting used to it"" is the equivalent to making your brain more deficient than it already is so that you can reduce the stimulants pique effects. And possibly adding deficiency to things that are working ok to start with. Better to take less meds and possibly add on a supplement to add a boost to get to where you need to be. Like less stim and add an acetylcholine enhancer and see how it does for you. Or skip the stim and try a non stim option like strattera and see if you respond to it. People don't all respond the same to different options.   


Others probably can give you better advice on stack changes to manage your particular issues. But I would recommend making sure you re getting the right calcium and magnesium daily and in the right ratio to help mitigate overstimulation of your NMDA receptors which amphetamine often causes excitotoxicity damage. I think methylphenidate does too but not as bad. And may possibly be a factor in your overstimulation. People always talk of Adderall and dopamine. But reality is ADHD stim effects NE, serotonin, as well as your orexic, glutaminergic, and histaminergic systems and probably more stuff as well. 

Should keep Ca:mg ratio between 1.7 to 2.6. from all sources. Targeting 2:1. There are things like mementine that are purported to help protect overstim of NMDA receptors too but others would know more than I do about that I hope.  Either way, take a multivitamin and I would recommend a moderate dose B-complex vitamin daily in the morning too. Proper levels of selenium and zinc to support Glutathione among other things as well. Especially if taking amphetamine based stims.   


I'd also take wikipedia with a grain of salt. There are a lot of things that piss me off in the Adderall/amphetamine page. A lot of bias in there if you know what to look for.  


Hard thing is, shrinks really don't know enough about the underlying mechanisms of ADHD stimulants, but they are still the best first resource to work with. If you have further issues, try an ADHD specialist if not already, neurologist or a neuropsychiatrist or even an integrative psychiatry place. Just make sure if going integrative it's not one of those BS places just trying to upsell you supplements.
