I now suspect that my body somehow produces too much norepinephrine after using compounds dedicated to treating ADHD. Or else it reacts exacerbated in the presence of some norepinephrine.

I say this because despite feeling extremely motivated to be productive, at the same time I can't concentrate and organize my ideas. And I associate this problem with a fight or flight state, that is, the production of norepinephrine.

So I want to test this theory by trying to somehow block the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine.

Can you name some compounds that have this effect?",False,t5_4aoxhu,What nootropics/supplements can decrease the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/147qgr3/what_nootropicssupplements_can_decrease_the/
