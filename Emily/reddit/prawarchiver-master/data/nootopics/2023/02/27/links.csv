I don’t abuse it or anything, I just take it as prescribed for sleep. Besides the fact that it is an opiate, it’s something specifically unique about Ambien that lifts my mood mentally and makes me feel happy, bubbly and very affectionate? 
I plan to stop my Ambien in the near future just because I’m trying to get off of most prescription medicine. What does Ambien do to the brain? What are the receptors it hits? obviously I know that it is a controlled substance and gives a feeling of euphoria, but I feel like it also does something else for me and I can’t quite place it.",False,t5_4aoxhu,how to replicate Ambien antidepressant properties?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11dv28t/how_to_replicate_ambien_antidepressant_properties/

I've tried Polygala and I like it since it helps with overthinking and mild anxiety.

The only downside I've got is that it seems to **raise histamine* (I've already have high histamine levels) and I get itchy scalp.

Do you have any suggestion to avoid/minimize this side effect?

Maybe pairing Polygala with something that decreases histamine, such as *stinging nettle leaf, holy basil, reishi or quercetin*?

Thanks!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Polygala and histamine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/11dlffq/polygala_and_histamine/
