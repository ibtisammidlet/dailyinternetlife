Komputer_One,"I quite like tropisetron. It really helps with headaches and nausea for me. The effects it has on vision is nice as well.

What else did you experience from TAK? I have an order of it on the way for me but I'm quite curious to know what to expect or be aware of it.

It's interesting to know that I'm not the only to feel irritated while using agmatine sulfate. I do not have depression however it help with anhedonia. 

Thank you for you anecdotes. It is much need since TAK-653 and Tropisetron aren't widely used.",1676169382,j86yzq2,t3_11044ab,t3_11044ab,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

WelcomeMasses,"Damn, what effects do you get from it, and what kind of dosages are you using?

To me it seems like a nice little boost at lower doses (<10mg).

BDNFan,">What else did you experience from TAK?

When I first started taking TAK was during my semi-daily weed use. This combo is incredibly potent and most likely induces aberrant synaptogenesis. Typically the first few days after smoking I am left socially dissociated. When I was using TAK daily this was greatly exacerbated. I was self-conscious, idle, slightly delusional and more HPPD

After quitting weed and fasting it out of my fat. I got back into TAK and it was amazing. I noticed some introspection boost / antidepressant effect, but continued to leave me *slightly* antisocial. I assumed this was a lingering side effect of the weed combination. The antisocial aspect disappeared after my DMT + TAK experiment and all positive effects were greatly potentiated.

I'd tell you my DMT experiment here, but it's long as fuck so I'll make another post about it",1676172389,j874w1e,t3_11044ab,t1_j86yzq2,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

labratdream,If you are responder in the best case instant enhancement of mental processing speed especially increased verbal fluency and expansion of the scope of vocabulary and faster learning speed of verbal material. But this milder than another positive cognitive effect of cyclazodone on the attention which results in  prolonged capacity for sustained focus of attention at unbelievable depth level and without the impairment of cognitive flexibility but partially similar due to similar capacity of methylphenidate used in beyond therapeutic levels  to narrow the focus and and increase the focus depth on lesser amount of items simultaneously perceived at decreased processing speed which suppose allows to change direct the overall mental reources on singular or limited amount of items increases the capacity to filter distractions and process them more slower then items within narrowed focused attention scope. From experience I believe that stims at high doses slighly change perception and its depth and intrnsity and are capable to affect the perception of time to make it feel slower and incresed neurotransmission deceases the speed of processing to small but perceiveable extent. The reality feels more intense sensually and perception of spatial and temporal dimensions are affacted too because the feeling of being here and now feels diffetent but the visual enhencement of perception of reality will be first to notice because colors are more colourfull and view is more sharp. However the big advantage of cyclazodone is that it doesn't decrease the speed of shift between the narrow to broader like in case of methylphendiate and its effect to cause tunnel vision and narrow and deep focus but the expansion of attention from narrow to broader focus but with lesser depth on larger amounts of items simultaneuosly  perceived slowly because the processing speed is slower than in the first case. Thankfully Cyclazodone doesn't impair the flexibility and speed of attention shift which is a very common foundation for proficiency in solving intellectual tasks which involve mental operations on data which sounds like a term from computer science but in case of brain the data is are memories and mental operations is thinking and you cant think about nothing or move technically conduct mental operations without data. The so called thinking is what we commonly identify with the term smartness and which is what we measure in majority of iq tests.,1676763279,j93iod1,t3_11044ab,t1_j912xfx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

WelcomeMasses,"Awesome, man. Thanks for the explanation.

(Were you on cyclazodone when you wrote this, btw? Because you wrote a ton, LOL.)

What kind of dosages have you found to work best for you?

For me, 15mg orally just felt too adrenergic and uncomfortable. Like there was too much tension in my body that I couldn't do anything with. I didn't even feel like working out.

Doses of about 8mg provide a nice boost. But it's a bit more subtle. Maybe 10-12mg will be the sweet spot.

labratdream,"Perhaps it sounded like encouragement but it is not. Even now after testing hundreds of cognitive enhancers I still  consider Cyclazodone the best one even after considering the unknown safety profile especially the possiblility of fatal hepatotoxicity due to structural similarity to a pemoline which was a reason it was withdrawn from the market because of very few but serious cases of hepatotoxicity some of which resulted in liver transplant or death.  
Most importantly is not to forget that cyclazodone is a stimulant and that every stimulant is addictive and the stimulant effect is not limited to the brain but also a body which is an arousal state from the very first use to the very last  and in the worst case when addiction develops the physical damage especiallt to the cardiovascular system is a certain. In case of this particular one, quite unique class of stims cyclazodone is one the most prominent member keep in mind that after years of regular use and within therapeutic limit which inventors  set up to 30mg per day you may find out that this drug has the other advantages over other stims such as a very benign comedown and slower tolerance buildup. This may lead to one time abuses to finish the extra work at the job or as a cramming tool to pass an exam.  The intensity and number of cardiovascular side effects which occur less likely in comparison to other stimulants and on top of this less benign comedowns may eventually lead repeated abuse and underestimation of addictive potential as well as the severity of side effects for cyclazodone which are basically the same as with other stims and the only difference is the longer time to occur but not the severity of them. 

So if you have never used a stimulant consider if you want to even start because after years of moderate usage you may become addicted to them without being aware of it contrary to popular belief even for the time of addiction you may be fully functional and it may go unnotticed by the others but the physical damage to the brain and body especially inflicted on the cardiovascular system will not be fully repairable back to the baseline level of performance it was before the addiction.",1677034524,j9i1q27,t3_11044ab,t1_j94v0vc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

WelcomeMasses,">after testing hundreds of cognitive enhancers I still consider Cyclazodone the best one

That's a really solid endorsement. 

I agree with you in regards to its potential for addictiveness, because it can be so smooth.

Because you're so experienced with it, here's my one question for you though:

What dosage and frequency have you found to be most beneficial for you? And what route of administration do you think is best?

E.g. 10mg once a day taken orally",1677071654,j9jmbm9,t3_11044ab,t1_j9i1q27,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,Well my initial dose was about 10-12mg and then after some time I doubled it but I must admit it wasn't the best dose in terms of intensity or duration of effects and I eventually ended up with 60mg sometimes twice a day which gave reduced my need for sleep during working days to a total 8-12 hours per 5 days plus additional extra 12-15 hours during the days of the weekend and I repeated this pattern of behaviour for months which from the time perspective is hard to believe. Another thing is a focus with a compulsion to gather the vast amounts of data sometimes to the point of physical exhaustion not reaching the next decision making step based upon the gathered data. Keep in mind that such abusive dose will be harmful and I personally experienced quite a scary aside effect which was a temporal blindspot in one of my eyes probably caused by the brust of a minor vein in the eye which luckily resolved within the minutes though I didn't rely solely on the luck and to prevent and limit the harmful side effects with each dose of cyclazodone I took about a dozen of medicines and supplements to address a broad range of side effects like for example the one preventing the raptures of veins by strengthening their structure.,1677082656,j9k7f2p,t3_11044ab,t1_j9jmbm9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
