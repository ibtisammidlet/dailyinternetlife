ScienceWins_87,"Loved the write up, thanks for sharing. DMT + TAK 653 is clearly something of an unusual and quite out there combination.",1676187609,j87tjvl,t3_1107lvu,t3_1107lvu,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
BurtonThescribe,"Eutropoflavin, bromantane and psylocibine(megadose) works well too. But eutropo is probably totally different than TAK. Never tried it, sadly",1676195242,j882s7k,t3_1107lvu,t3_1107lvu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

BDNFan,"Thanks bro

But yeah I figured I was one of the first to try the combo lol",1676190152,j87wpvx,t3_1107lvu,t1_j87tjvl,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,"Great nootropic it pairs well with TAK, never did much to confidence or social interaction for me but it's a great mood boost

Honestly the best thing I got out of this experience was the visualization boosting. I've noticed that it really helped my ability to learn and integrate knowledge by watching and visualizing.

Before this, I was limited to learning by physically doing the task myself while I'm given instructions. Now it's far easier to listen to what someone says --> visualize --> integrate before I even start the task",1676179494,j87hpjq,t3_1107lvu,t1_j87gso9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

AromaticPlant8504,Does Tak improve visualizing on its own or you need to take DMT also for that effect?,1676224881,j89l54d,t3_1107lvu,t1_j87hpjq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,"I avoid it due to potential Liver-failure / toxicity & other side effects. It's method of action is counterproductive for cognitive enhancement due to it being a GABA-A PAM.

In addition to this, iirc it's neurotoxic to combine Gabaergic drugs with AMPA PAMs. I'm not trying to ditch my beloved TAK so that's another reason why I'm not interested",1676181510,j87l17b,t3_1107lvu,t1_j87is6u,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,It does this in a way. It makes me think more spatially and I think because of this it can cross over to visualization,1676230226,j89ye4c,t3_1107lvu,t1_j89l54d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
