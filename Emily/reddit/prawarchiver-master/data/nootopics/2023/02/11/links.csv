After semi-chronic and adolescent THC use I developed some frustrating lasting side effects including; social dissociation, aphantasia, and depression. Shortly after that I abused nutmeg (I know) and developed HPPD, Learning difficulties, and further intensified my social overstimulation & dissosciation. ***This self inflicted damage is why I got into nootropics***

**Goal:** After detoxing THC with fasting and exercise for a month. I decided to try microdosing DMT, which helped my HPPD and anxiety in the past. But this time I'd add TAK and see where it takes me.

**Dosing Regimen / INFO**

* Extended-duration micro DMT doses after a highly social day. I dosed 4 times in 2 weeks. I took 3mg TAK in the morning before the social event and would vape DMT around 4 PM.
* On microdose days I would vape very small amounts of DMT while playing the guitar. I took 3-5 baby hits in the span of 30-60 minutes.

I have microdosed DMT in the past without TAK and I can say it's very different and less noticeable. Through out the week where I was microdosing with TAK I noticed a number of interesting lingering effects;

**Week 1**

* Noticing potentiation of TAK's typical benefits; introspection, analyzation and most pronounced now -- Antidepressant boost
* During these social events I could see through and break down the complexities of social interaction.
* My favorite result of this experiment is more social involvement. It got rid of my tendency to dissociate from stressful interaction
* My ""inner-eye"" or visualization skills dramatically improved, it really helped my weed-induced aphantasia

**Week 2**

* I now notice my HPPD is *altered* but not worsened. It was just as staticky but felt more *beautiful* and less *glitchy*.
* At night I practice inducing CEVs with my eyes closed. These are fun to explore. Dreams are wild and serve as automatic premeditation.
* Because of my staticky HPPD I could *almost* see my visualizations with my eyes open if I tried hard enough. After practicing I found I could actually see a string or rope tying people to phone's, people, etc..
* I could see a visual manifestation of the way I interpreted the dopaminergic attachment to their surroundings.
* Now this may sound delusional but I was fully aware it was a hallucination, and one that I actually had to force myself to see.
* I can sense a god-complex forming because my state of awareness made me realize how many others are not aware.

**Week 4 (Now)**

* My 1st TAK bottle is gone and I'm on my second. I discontinued DMT after the second week
* These open eye visuals faded but my analytical and introspective skills remain
* Antidepressant effects are just as strong and I'm still more outgoing and confident socially

**Review**

* The TAK made me very sensitive to the cumulative effects of the DMT. Typically DMT micro dosing gave me a mild afterglow but never kept me in a semi-psychedelic state like this experiment definitely induced.  
* I feel more stable now and my mild God-Complex has faded. It never became a problem but my ego had been lifted when I was able to break down and quantify social patterns so easily
* This was an overall positive experiment but next time I will reduce the frequency of DMT dosing",False,t5_4aoxhu,DMT + TAK-653 Experiment,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1107lvu/dmt_tak653_experiment/

These are the most effective noots I've tried and I've done all the Bullshit ND placebos too.

**1.TAK-653**

introspection, analytical skills, mental visualization and antidepressant. **NOTE:** Makes THC psychotic, this combo intensified my HPPD and brain-fog. On the other hand after quitting weed TAK greatly helped my aphantasia and poor memory.

**2. Tropisetron**

Clears my HPPD by 50-60% consistently, depth perception increase, really nice smooth focus, Household nausea remedy, added bonus as a diarrhea antidote.

Something else I experience on tropi is it's potent anxiolysis. One side effect of my HPPD is the tendency to get socially overstimulated. Interestingly, Tropisetron vastly reduces this and I have some theories of my own about nAChRs, specifically a7, in involvement with HPPD.

**3. Agmatine Sulfate**

This noot annihilates depression, and an amazing combo with TAK. Something people may think of as a side effect is increased irritation. For me though this is generally positive because of my people-pleasing tendency to put others wants over mine. Agmatine irritation makes it feel natural and justified to create boundaries

**Weed Recovery Noots**

* Istradefylline (Deactivates CB1 via a2a antagonism)
* Pregnenolone (CB1 NAM)
* CBD (CB1 NAM)
* ALCAR (m1, upreg NMDA)

Over the past two years I have used both powdered Bromantane for more accurate dosing, as well as the EC nasal spray, with dosages ranging from 10mg-100mg. 

It takes me a long time to fall asleep generally but when I use Bromantane I can fall asleep within 30-60 minutes without issue. It does wonders for my overall energy levels the morning after if I take it at night, but I do not experience the direct stimulatory effects that others reportedly experience.
