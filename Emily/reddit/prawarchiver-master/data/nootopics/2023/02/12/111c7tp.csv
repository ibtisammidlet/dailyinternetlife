As for sleep quality, didn't notice much, maybe I had sufficient blood levels already.",1676308875,j8e4yw4,t3_111c7tp,t3_111c7tp,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Citrate is low bioavailability used as a laxative

Glycinate is good for brain or sleep , threonate allegedly bedt for the brain but its hinky science

And mag glycinate is cheao",1676324371,j8f8mcx,t3_111c7tp,t3_111c7tp,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Not sure where you saw the citrate form recommended for sleep, but it's not terribly common as a supplement given its poor bioavailability. Magnesium citrate is most commonly used as a laxative, if I'm not mistaken.

Magnesium L-Threonate (Magtein) is probably the form I see most commonly recommended for cognitive benefit. I've recently begun taking this myself (picked mine up from ND), so the jury is still out on my opinion (<3 mo).

It does, however, appear to be the first form of magnesium that actually meets the claim of not causing GI discomfort for me. I've lost count of how many forms I've tried unsuccessfully.",1676311543,j8ebm1v,t3_111c7tp,t3_111c7tp,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

OutrageousBit2164,"Check on yourself

In my case all magnesium forms cause insomnia. 

Citrate 
Glycinate 
Taurate 
Bisglycinate
Malate etc.

Some people just have problems with magnesium being used to form ATP more than NMDA antagonism. 


Btw citrate and malate are part of KREBs cycle so I would advise against it.

Bisglycinate/taurate should be more suitable for sleep.

But as we all know... There are no RULES YMMV ðŸ˜„",1677513619,ja87ykm,t3_111c7tp,t3_111c7tp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
