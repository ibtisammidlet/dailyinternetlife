Also, any pitfalls or adverse reactions to be aware of? 

I'm specifically interested in what the consensus on the following topics are:

1) Dosage (or ranges) for effective, sustainable results
2) Is cycling Agmatine helpful / necessary?
3) Are tolerance breaks (t breaks) helpful / necessary?

For clarification, I mean ""necessary"" in the sense of maintaining the effectiveness and/or sustainability of Agmatine use.

I've been using Agmatine since August of last year and while I feel that it's been helpful, I've never seen some of the benefits many claim (for example, reduction in tolerance to and/or potentiation of other substances).

Started off at 250 mg 3x daily, now at 2 g twice daily. I don't cycle use and have not taken any t breaks, though I don't feel any ""need"" to use Agmatine, so I'm more interested in the dosages people find helpful.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Agmatine as an antidepressant: dosages, cycling, etc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/110px7r/agmatine_as_an_antidepressant_dosages_cycling_etc/
