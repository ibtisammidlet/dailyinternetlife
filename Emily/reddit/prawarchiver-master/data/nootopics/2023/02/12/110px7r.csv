Whatever_acc,"For my depression I took 1.2-1.8g twice a day (2.4-4.5g), sometimes more. About the rest, no idea. 

It helped anxiety more than it helped with depression.

Sometimes it initially made me insatiably hungry especially for carbs, but not always, for unknown reasons. Bad farts initially.",1676259086,j8btsjp,t3_110px7r,t3_110px7r,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"It definitely did initially. It's hard to say whether the results have been sustained, though. I feel like it was also helping with anxiety, but either things have gotten worse or I've become accustomed to those effects.

I've been having a difficult time in general of late, and I am currently dealing with a lot of fatigue, anxiety, and diminishing returns in general. My best guess is extreme chronic stress / burnout (mostly from work stress, but I'm just completely overwhelmed in general).

As such, I hesitate to render any judgment on Agmatine right now. At the least, it seems to be holding me more or less at status quo.",1676248571,j8b59ny,t3_110px7r,t1_j8auvws,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

In this paper they showed that naltrexone blocked the AD effects of ketamine, showing that there is an opioid-receptor mechanism essential to AD effects:

infrareddit-1,"Thanks, again. 

As I said above, agree with you on AMPA. I just think my opioid is involved as well. In addition, I think BDNF is involved as well. And optimization of GABA/Glutamate ratio. 

Depression seems to be multifactorial. AMPA alone is not going to do it.",1676312311,j8edjhp,t3_110px7r,t1_j8e9b25,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
