Hxmusa,"In my experience, if you‚Äôre used to stims it won‚Äôt give the same type of motivation. 

It‚Äôll give a motivation to improve your life but not ‚ÄúGet up off your ass and do something‚Äù. In my experience it just makes me feel bad if I‚Äôm not doing anything with my life which in turn makes me motivated indirectly if that makes sense.

That‚Äôs the best way I can describe it.

With caffeine (After around 3 hours) it definitely resembles a very small dose of Amphetamine for half an hour which then the ‚Äúget up off your ass‚Äù motivation kicks in. I use that pre workout.

3 sprays is also my sweet spot. Any more and it‚Äôs a little sedating. Any less and I can‚Äôt really feel it.

You have to get your technique right also. Make sure you have a clear nose and follow some tutorials on YouTube.",1677087863,j9kld4t,t3_119454s,t3_119454s,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Makes sense. You're basically guilt tripping yourself into getting stuff done because you feel guilty if you've done nothing. 

And I'm gonna start laying down and leaning my head back for 10 minutes after application. I've read that people have good success with this. Unfortunately, I have to limit my caffeine usage due to GERD.",1677088170,j9km7f1,t3_119454s,t1_j9kld4t,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Birdy1979,"Hiya, I read that with interest. Thank you üôè. I‚Äôm trying to gauge best dosage and cycling to avoid tolerance. I‚Äôm concluding it‚Äôs 3 sprays (27 mg), once or twice a day, for 3 days max a week, without further cycling.  But if I use more regularly, say 5 -6 times a week, then a whole week off.
I‚Äôm encouraged by anecdotes that it continues to work a number of days after discontinuation . 

Only question I need to figure out is whether it‚Äôs necessary to take twice a day.
