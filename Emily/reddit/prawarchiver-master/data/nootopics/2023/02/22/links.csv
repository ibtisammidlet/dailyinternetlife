I don't really feel much from it unless I do 3 to 4 sprays. Some of it still drips back out, so maybe I'm not getting the full dose from each spray. I took with 3g of L-Tyrosine. I also tried stacking with caffeine, Magtein and Sabroxy. 

My experience:

- Heart pumping
- Feel subtle energy
- Did NOT feel more motivated or like I had to get things done. I could just sit down with heart pumping and not feel agitated.

Questions:

- Anything else I should try stacking bromantane with? My goal is motivation so I can get stuff done around the house. 
-Would N-Acetyl-L-Tyrosine work better?
