In the informal survey on r/nootropics they found that this was one of the highest drugs with probability of being ""life-changing"" that increase synaptogenesis rather than just being a raw stimulant.

Risks: A study that sequenced all the ingredients found 638 random peptides and growth factors, none of which were known. It seems that the primary risks are autoimmune / prion / cancer risk. Tbh I think autoimmune and prion risks are relatively low as evidenced by the literature, but I could see the tumorigenic effects being significant, especially if these growth factors are binding to random receptors, some of which are oncologic (ie c-Met being an oncogene). In particular curious about your thoughts u/sirsadalot
