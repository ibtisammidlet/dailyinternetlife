,"The prion risk has been well prosecuted. Stay away from the cerebrolysin offshoots that use cattle and youre fine.

Pugs have the odd ability to essentially be immune to pripn diseases , they had to take mad cow and grow it in deer brain and then transfer that to pigs to get it to stick (or somethibg wacky like that) and even then it was like petri dish science. Luterally no natural pig prions and zero instances of pig to human or human to pig prion transfer.

50 or 70 years of use in the EU.

DidNotVote2020,"Anything that promotes growth will feed an existing cancer, but crashing estradiol/test/hgh/igf-1 is not healthy.

If your concerned about cancer your best bet is caloric restriction and keeping low but not too low (enough that you have no mental symptoms of deficiencies) levels of androgens and IGF-1 for the rest of your life. Eat keto for rest of life. Not taking anything that increases any growth factors. You give up protection against neurodegenerative disease for the hope of preventing any cancer development. That means no lion's mane and no nootropics at all beyond stuff that increases blood flow circulation in the brain.

Low dose naltrexone has many anti cancer effects and is much more sustainable.

Not sure I recommend this, but valproic acid titrated slowly, assuming you are not trying for kids, has many anti cancer effects in addition to facilitating a more childlike learning. That is not a pleasant medication and I haven't tried it myself. I dug through HDAC inhibitors awhile ago aside from tributyrin and eating celery the pharmaceutical options all had some major negative attached.

An alternative approach would be to cycle. A cycle of abundance, bulking, where you increase growth factors and build muscle, run nootropics, etc. Followed by a cycle of restriction: fasting, keto, intermittent fasting, caloric restriction, no increasing growth factors, and the like. My broscience is that this best follows our evolutionary history of having seasons of abundance and seasons of rationing.

> probability of being ""life-changing"" that increase synaptogenesis rather than just being a raw stimulant.

Well, that sub is full of people looking for powder that gets them high but is legal addy and can be bought with a debit card. Cerebrolysin and cortexin will not do that, but they are very effective at facilitating a disciplined and structured approach achieving a goal by by increasing a bunch of different growth factors and working through pathways we don't quite understand. 

Increasing neurogenesis doesn't mean shit if the people involved spend their days playing videos games and on porn. They are just adapting themselves more effectively to a lifestyle that is stagnant. All these compounds are a means to an end. Maybe for some that end is to reduce the risk or delay development of neurodegenerative disease, but for most it's more sustainable to have short-mid term goals that grow into a long term vision.

stinkykoala314,"Literally life changing. Been on it for 3 weeks, and having added it to helminthic therapy (HDC, 3 years -- see [the Helminthic Therapy Wiki](http://helminthictherapywiki.com) -- has completely eradicated the insomnia that has plagued my life until now. I can't emphasize enough how monumental this is. 

I've tried every sleep medication, every antidepressant, several different exercise regimens, keto and other dietary modifications, and literally hundreds of supplements and nootropics. Some helped enough to keep around (exercise, magnesium, helminths) and most didn't. I'd sleep 3 hours, or 6 with numerous interruptions. My body needs 8-9, as I dimly remember from my high school days before the insomnia became crippling.

The first two days after starting cere I was sleeping 8-9 hrs, only waking up a few times. By the end of the first week I had reduced my sleep medications by 25% and was still sleeping well. Memory is much better (digit recall improved from 9 to 12 and still going), energy / personality / interest / focus / drive / sociability / humor / dexterity all at levels I haven't had since my 20s (42 now).

The heuristic I've heard for cere is that it can be miraculous for restoring lost function, but won't give you anything you didn't already have before.

gluepancakes,"are you trolling re: helminthic therapy? my gut instinct is, understandably, disgust - is there scientific basis to it? What's the intuitive explanation for the mechanisms that make it actually good?

edit: looked into it, seems like the basic idea is parasites don't want to be killed - modulate your immune system to be less aggressive. Seems reasonable as a potential treatment for autoimmune diseases and reducing inflammation. 

I think my argument still stands though - it's very much a spectrum. Why not just infect yourself with bacteria periodically? Theoretically, we could say that there exists some mechanism through which we need to ""spend"" some quantity of a substance to maintain efficacy (ie how ejaculation improves prostate health). Or why not perform periodic bloodletting to reduce excessive iron levels? In the past, I'm sure we bled a lot more frequently, as we got into fights and cuts from various animals. Overall I think the risks of helminthic therapy are probably not worth it, unless you have an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder that is moderately to severely affecting your life.",1679334889,jcz6ixi,t3_11eefxt,t1_jcxzkrs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
