Hi there,

I would like to try out a low dosage of 1 or 2 mg Memantine. The thing is, I got some 10mg tablets (bluely coated) from Rupharma which dont seem to be meant to be splitted. I have once tried a 10mg pill and it took me to a different dimension which was an aweful feeling. So I really want to start with a very low dose.

what could be the worst thing to happen if I crush a 10mg pill and divide it into 5 portions (filling in empty capsules)? Could this work?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Need Advice On Preparing a Very Low Dose Of Memantine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10udi1b/need_advice_on_preparing_a_very_low_dose_of/
