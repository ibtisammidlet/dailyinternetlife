Internal_Security_44,"What's the best way to convince my Dr to prescribe this to me ? He thinks it's only for Alzheimer's. I don't want to sound like I know more than him , but he is just a GP and doesn't specialize in mental health and off lable uses of these type of drugs. He's a good dude in general. Should I just explain the effects of glutamate antagonists have on anxiety?",1675628649,j7cmn9g,t3_10udi1b,t3_10udi1b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,Yup weigh out the whole pill.  Determine the Memantine to filler ratio.  Then crush the pill thoroughly.  Then calculate how much of the crushed up powder you need to take to get your 2mg.,1675646363,j7drj7i,t3_10udi1b,t3_10udi1b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,You arent meant to start from large amounts. It takes two weeks for alzheimer patients to go from 5 to 20mg.,1678280220,jbearru,t3_10udi1b,t3_10udi1b,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

iakobos,Bring in research articles. Print them out if you have to.,1675630282,j7cqpad,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7cmn9g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Internal_Security_44,Great idea. It seems like it's what I need. Topamax works but it hurts my eyes . I can tell it's glutamate antagonist properties have a great impact on making my mind quite down.,1675630390,j7cqz6y,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7cqpad,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
iakobos,Yeah Topomax can be a little rough. Have you ever tried lamotrigine?,1675630712,j7crs5j,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7cqz6y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Internal_Security_44,"No. Is it a glutamate antagonist?

Edit: I looked it up. It looks like it does and it works on gaba as well. Is it as strong as mematine? I for sure need to switch from topamax ASAP.",1675630740,j7crumn,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7crs5j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
iakobos,"Not as strong as memantine with respect to glutamate, but the side effect profile is extremely tolerable",1675631251,j7ct40a,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7crumn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Internal_Security_44,Thanks for the tip! Have you tried either one?,1675631463,j7ctn3w,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7ct40a,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
iakobos,"Yep, tried both. I haven't been able to get memantine consistently enough to give a proper review, but I found it moderately effective. Lamotrigine I've been on for ~17 years for bipolar disorder. No issues so far!",1675632074,j7cv537,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7ctn3w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Internal_Security_44,How come you can't get it consistently? Is it hard to get prescribed? Sorry bout all the questions,1675632280,j7cvn4c,t3_10udi1b,t1_j7cv537,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
