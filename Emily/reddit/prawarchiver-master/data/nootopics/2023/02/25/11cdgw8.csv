,"[Yeh , nitrous oxide seems to act as a cotransmitter in the raphe nucleus and as far as we know nowhere else](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3412368/)

Pretty early in the science but the implication is striking because the raphe nucleus is the master switch for all the serotonergic neurons in the brain.

So , the fact that the neruons in that area utilize Nos opens up a way to specifically target that.",1677414541,ja2shbz,t3_11cdgw8,t3_11cdgw8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
WouldYouCalmDown,"Nitrous oxide is a well known potent ndma antagonist that also causes the release of norepinephrine. Part of its ability to be used recreationally in higher doses as a dissociative without passing out is due to the norepinephrine component. 

But it does have detrimental effects if you are low on b2 or b12, and also depletes b12 due to scavenging of cobalin. As well as the formation of ROS in multiple settings. 
There's a reason it's always given in a 50:50 mixture with oxygen during anesthesia. 

Overall honestly long term use doesn't have a promising view given the amount of underlying factors that can lead to neurotoxicity

,"Well. The ""rapid effect"" probably isnt dependant on the RN area I brought up , it is laughing gas after all. I was just brining up an orthagonal but related line of study",1677434063,ja3z7jy,t3_11cdgw8,t1_ja3xu20,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Oh yes , i'm just flitty and the article you posted made me remeber that.

IIRC xenon inhaled also boosts mood and cognition. I know gases work intersynaptically as backward messengers so I imagine the receptors are just sort of lazy and take any old gas that comes along as a ligand (but we definitepy dont have the evidence base to hold me to that!)",1677434724,ja40wn8,t3_11cdgw8,t1_ja3zl4j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
