Switch_23,"Sounds very similar to me. I can wake up, up to 20 times per night ... It's a state of extra vigilance, ie. anxiety which could be caused by the autoimmune thing you have going on. How's your gut health?

Conversely, the only thing that helps for me are H1 antagonist's. Nothing helps as much as they do. Not even benzos. So it's a matter of increasing sleep pressure and decreasing REM, increasing SWS. Unfortunately H1 receptors desensitize rather quickly, so it's not a reall solution to the problem, but it goes to show that histamine is a problem. 

Considering you have a histamine problem (how do you know this?), it makes sense. No magnesium, inositol, p5p, etc. bs is going to make an appreciable difference here, I'm sorry. This are just the most common layman internet recommendations everybody gives.

Histamine receptors are very tightly connected to wakefulness and in fact, is what narcoleptics have problems with. Modafinil, for instance, increases histaminergic tone. The orexin system, which is the system responsible for wakefulness, works via the histamine system.

So my advice for you is to work on your histamine issues.

And what will work for you as a band aid is to increase your sleep pressure via H1 antagonists.

You can also have overmethylation which is responsible for Ach synthesis. 

I would advise you to check how you react to cholinergics (neck muscle spasms, anxiety, poor sleep, fatigue, brain fog, depression, anhedonia) if you have DNA test done you can check SNP's for choline metabolism and methylation.


I removed all cholinergcs from my life and added Forskolin and Bromantane which decrease Ach. + take non methylated B complex and avoid methyl donors such as Creatine,TMG

Sounds like you very well could have MCAS or something connected to your mast cells (I read that you had problems with acetylcholine supplements which is something I always have had), when it comes to that, first getting it diagnosed/ruled out is step number one, if you have it then make sure to remove all possible triggers for mast cells like high histamine food, histamine liberators food, supplements, mold and etc.

Also, from wiki: *Cetirizine crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier only slightly, and for this reason, produces minimal sedation compared to many other antihistamines.*

Histamines agonizing histamine receptors in the brain is the problem, not in the periphery. Try something that crosses the BBB a bit more like diphenhydramine or ketotifen, mirtazapine, trazadone, etc ...

>Agmatine, reishi, CBD oil, nigella sativa

I have exp only with CBD and it's going to help as much as relieving anxiety helps but in of it self, 5-HT1a agonism is contraindicated for sleep. One of the reasons why SSRI's are bad for sleep. However, in the case of too much REM, it might be useful to a degree, as serotonin lowers REM sleep. But it's only a band aid at best and it's also temporary as HT1a's downregulate rather quickly. But CBD can also raise glutamate signaling, which will make you dream even more. Anyway, no harm in trying it out.
