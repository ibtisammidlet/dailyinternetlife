BDNFan,"This is true low dose nic gum / patches are cognitive enhancing but have diminishing returns due to quick tolerance development. In the wise words of sirsad: 

>It is likely that this cognition enhancement is due to a7 nAChR \[[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/1300393)\] and the fact that Wellbutrin doesn't impair cognition in healthy people further supports this \[[2](https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-005-0128-y)\] 

Tropisetron is king, but my favorite thing is to combine them. Tropisetron definitely potentiates nicotine, I feel it in my body and my vision clears up like crazy",1676922403,j9bste6,t3_117gvl2,t3_117gvl2,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

DrBobMaui,"Thanks for this combo idea, I really like it! 

So I would really appreciate what would be generally a good starting dose with each, and do you take them at the same time? Any tips would be appreciated as well.

All the best too!",1676931100,j9cew2t,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9bste6,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

BDNFan,"dose 5-10mg tropisetron wait for onset \~10-20 minutes, then take 2mg nic gum whenever",1676934369,j9cmtwz,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9cew2t,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,"Most likely not, nicotine mainly hits a4b2 and other nAChRs while Tropisetron just hits a7 which is vital for cognitive function 

Peripheral a7 also meditates anti-inflammatory response so Tropisetron will probably give you the opposite of physical sides",1676997384,j9frk6n,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9etuo8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

BDNFan,It's mostly stimulation and positive task reinforcement. The heightened dopamine is connected to the task rather than the gum due to the extended half life. This is why smoking is far more addictive,1676951547,j9do4fo,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9dmq4y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Liszt01,"And in relation to concentration, working memory, fluidity of reasoning, did you feel anything?  The same questions are valid for Tropisetron, I ask such questions because I try to find something less aggressive to treat ADHD, because at the moment I don't feel safe to try something more ""heavy"", because I am new in this world of nootropics and I don't have much technical knowledge",1676958091,j9dziok,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9do4fo,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,"Tropisetron helps working memory a bit, sustained focus, and some mild anxiolysis that helps with cognitive flexibility. tropi seems like a great ""non aggressive"" ADHD noot while in contrast I doubt nic will help you.

Another thing I notice with Tropisetron is visual depth perception is boosted, along with VS reduction. It's interesting, this vision alteration is the main thing I appreciate with tropi",1676958311,j9dzure,t3_117gvl2,t1_j9dziok,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
