Since some time, I'm having this issue.
I'm not having nightmares, but vivid dreams that cause many ""micro-wakeups"" during the night.

I'm not really waking up (and I have no problems in falling asleep) but my deep sleep is affected and I get too much REM sleep. Fitbit seems to confirm this.

Is there anything that can help? Somebody in the past adviced *agmatine*, but AFAIK it raises histamine (I already have high histamine levels).

I have a theory that maybe the cause could be **too much acetylcholine**. Does it make sense?
However, that would be odd, since I'm taking an anti-histamine daily (for an autoimmune skin disease), and AFAIK antihistamines *lower* acetylcholine.

Another theory is that it could be caused by some kind of **brain inflammation**, since in the past, when I took Ibuprofen before sleep (for other reasons), my sleep seemed to improve. But maybe it was just a coincidence.
