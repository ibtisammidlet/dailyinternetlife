SunDevil329,"Update 3/30: tried trop 5mg with Cymbalta 60mg a few times. Works well for anxiety, but unfortunately it is contraindicated for me due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Caused constipation and bloating, side effects that I seem to be especially sensitive to due to IBS.

I'd recommend trop to others so long as constipation and/or IBS are not already issues for you. Most people seem to be able to tolerate 5mg without constipation, so ymmv.

On an unrelated note, TAK-653 does not seem to have any issues with Cymbalta (and presumably other SNRIs and SSRIs). I've been taking 1-1.5mg regularly for a few weeks now. 1mg seems to work best for me, as higher doses cause anxiety and restlessness.",1680218121,jec7v46,t3_117iugn,t3_117iugn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
