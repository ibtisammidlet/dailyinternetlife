infrareddit-1,"Congratulations on stopping benzos. I have visited r/benzorecovery and gotten a sense there of just how difficult this can be. 

This is the first and best thing you’ll do for your memory. Piracetam is a very safe thing to try, and there are some data suggesting it may help with memory, particularly when there are deficits. 

Another option supported by data is the herb bacopa monnieri.",1675621822,j7c5rp0,t3_10tp64n,t3_10tp64n,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
insaneinthecrane,"This is a very common issue from everyday benzo use. Biggest thing you can do by far for benefit other than sustained quitting which it seems like your already doing is making sure you’re getting a full night of high quality sleep every night and exercising often. Aside from that, diet and supplements can but not always have a significant impact as well. 

Some people get memory benefits from choline supplementation or other supplements / drugs that positively affect acetylcholine. Gotta pay attention to how you feel. Many people are deficient and notice energy and mood boost as well as alleviation of brain fog and memory benefits. Some people on the other hand are sensitive and may start to feel more brain fog or lethargic and mildly depressed from too much choline. Best source of it from diet is eggs. A more potent supplemental version of it you can try is alpha gpc (some recommend cdp choline but I’ve heard many have issues due to how much it can build up in your system over time). Other things that affect choline are things like huperzine A and many people get benefit from bacopa monierri (though bacopa can make some people feel bland or lethargic over time particularly if you have adhd). 

A B complex and omega 3s can also be beneficial. Magnesium threonate can also mildly improve memory over time (though watch that it doesn’t disturb sleep like it does with some people, though it should actually help it). 

Many people benefit a lot simply from caffeine as well often taken with l theanine if you find caffeine normally too jittery. If none of this seems to help, many people seem to get  great benefit from noopept or racetam drugs like aniracetam or Piracetam (though racetams are hard to find these days). All these are often supplemented with choline as they can quickly deplete choline levels. Lastly if you happen to have adhd and are untreated prescription options will probably be more effect than anything (aside from good sleep, exercise and diet). These include the classic stimulants like adderall, vyvanse, or Dexedrine or options like modafinil or armodafinil (provigil / nuvigil)

Also I know you’re in college so this may be difficult but alcohol and cannabis definitely hinder good memory formation and retention (i say this as someone who used them in the past and was in denial but it’s very true and only fully realized once quitting both )",1675547855,j78hnk3,t3_10tp64n,t3_10tp64n,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

CriaturaDemente,"Thank you for responding! I started weight lifting about a month after stopping Alprazolam and it was difficult but certainly helped in falling asleep. I think I may have some Coluracetam, Piracetam, Oxiracetam, Fasoracetam, and Pramiracetam left. Do you know if any of them will work better for memory retention?

insaneinthecrane,"Have you tried any of the racetams already? They all work a bit differently and effect everyone differently. Some people get great benefit, others actually may feel more foggy on them, and others won’t respond to them at all. They are all very safe but It all just requires  being very aware of how each is effecting you and approaching it with care. Again choline supplementation is often necessary for good effect from them but also will sometimes make it worse. It’s unfortunately quiet complex and some people may get issues like a headache or brain fog from too little choline and others get those issues with too much. So again just requires slow and careful approach to find the balance that works for you. I wouldn’t recommend using them for than a few days a week though Piracetam you could probably get away with daily with breaks here and there to kind of reset and reassess. 

I’d say pramiracetam is probably the most effective for memory of the ones you have and maybe give an instant acute effect. It can be slightly stimulating and can give you a pretty pronounced focus effect. Beware some people can get focused kind of to the point of being kind of irritable with short tempered with people but I find it less pushy than something like  adderall as long as dose is kept somewhat low (~300mg though you can go higher if you don’t notice issues).

Piracetam is good as well but far more subtle and you may not notice improvement until after taking it for a couple weeks or so. Oxiracetam to me is a nice subtle and smooth stimulant feeling while still feeling very much like yourself whereas coluracetam and fasoracetam will be more anxiolytic. Some people even find fasoracetam slightly sedating but a kind of calm and focused way. Personally I enjoy almost all of them except coluracetam as it makes me just feel a bit “weird” in a way I can’t quite put my finger on. Sorry again I know it’s been kinda complex but it really just kinda requires listening to your body and trying one at a time to see if you get a benefit from any of them",1675644652,j7dnvme,t3_10tp64n,t1_j7cob3a,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

CriaturaDemente,It’s okay. I apologize for the late response. I haven’t tried Racetams in months if not a year or two. I will be trying them tonight as I have a test due tomorrow. I think I’m going to try Pramiracetam first then. Thank you for your advice! I really appreciate it!,1675910267,j7sl55z,t3_10tp64n,t1_j7dnvme,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
verysatisfiedredditr,"Thats crazy they gave you baclofen, as i remember it can put you in a week long coma without killing you, seemed like a one way ticket to hell

Youre right about skullcap, its just that its really mild and seems to have alot of other benefits.  Alot of gaba herbs give me 'withdrawals' with even occasional use, such as valerian and magnolia.  i just don't get that from skullcap imo.",1675569916,j79r85t,t3_10tp64n,t1_j79a6ui,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
