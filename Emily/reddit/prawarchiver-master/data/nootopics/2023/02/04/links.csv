I took Xanax for ~10 months increasing to 2mg everyday. I have been off completely since July 2022. In college now and I am having memory problems. Any advice on what would help me recover? Or at least boost my memory for the time being as I am in college? Any help would be greatly appreciated!,False,t5_4aoxhu,Benzodiazepine Memory deficits?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10tp64n/benzodiazepine_memory_deficits/
