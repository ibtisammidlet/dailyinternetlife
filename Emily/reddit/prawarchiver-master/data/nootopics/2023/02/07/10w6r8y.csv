""Results show that roflumilast improves sensory gating in healthy young human volunteers only at the 100-μg dose. The effective dose of 100 μg is five times lower than the clinically approved dose for the treatment of acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). No side-effects, such as nausea and emesis, were observed at this dose.""",1675849184,j7osc3p,t3_10w6r8y,t1_j7lq11m,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Seems they used a selective PDE4 inhibitor called rolipram in the study. Per Wikipedia, rolipram was explored as a prototype antidepressant in the early 90s, but was discontinued in clinical trials.

The prescription medication roflumilast (Daliresp in the US) appears to be the only selective PDE4 inhibitor that I'm seeing. It's FDA approved for the treatment of COPD, so you'd need a prescription in the states.",1675803652,j7mccif,t3_10w6r8y,t1_j7lq11m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
