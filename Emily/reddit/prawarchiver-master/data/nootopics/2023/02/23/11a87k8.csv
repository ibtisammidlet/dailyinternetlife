lambjenkemead,"The three people who trialed it on the discord all gave it raves after first trial. Much more calming, anxiolytic and antidepessive than Tak. I think he’s just figuring out what ROA he wants to go with for efficacy and cost effectiveness.",1677190285,j9qs9mo,t3_11a87k8,t1_j9qkeqg,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

GmodZ,You're not suppose to feel anything lol. There's no euphoria to tak.,1677198501,j9rce8z,t3_11a87k8,t1_j9r7tzy,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Sure of what? I’m just reporting what the three people on the nootopics discord who tried Neboglamine said after a first pass. I was saying that one of them specifically said they preferred Nebo to Tak,1677197649,j9radu9,t3_11a87k8,t1_j9r7tzy,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,"This is a direct quote from one of the people who tried it: 

“They feel very different

With TAK it helps me come up with complex ideas, dreams and introspection

With Neboglamine it feels very anti stress, mood boosting/ antidepressant, meditative and brings me closer to my own cognisance. And while I haven't tried it daily to test this, in theory it should produce an aversion to non productive hedonism.”",1677209356,j9s0o7m,t3_11a87k8,t1_j9rhai8,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,At least two of them are also on Tak as well. Don’t think they mentioned anything specific about the combination.,1677208591,j9rz28w,t3_11a87k8,t1_j9rhguk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
