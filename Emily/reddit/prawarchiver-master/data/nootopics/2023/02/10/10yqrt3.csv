BackgroundShelter631,"I tried Palmitoylethanolamide for my cholinergic urticaria and it did nothing. Maybe a bioavailability issue? Theoretically, it should work, but it didn't help at all.",1676223769,j89ieri,t3_10yqrt3,t3_10yqrt3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Superb_Ad4373,"Slightly old thread, but found in as I'm waiting for a diagnosis of for my alopecia areata, which I think is histamine related and currently going down the rabbit hole.

I think it was triggered by Selank which is in your list, so I'd procede with caution on that. There's a few anecdotal reports of Selank/Semax flaring autoimmune disorders, even if undiagnosed. 

I've also been taking Lion's mane, and never knew there was a link between NGF and histamine. So I'll be stopping that straight away.",1690193217,jt8c1q3,t3_10yqrt3,t3_10yqrt3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Confident-Ease-3423,"As a possible MCAS sufferer myself, (boy if only I'd have known that word in the beginning) I find Theanine works for symptoms. Doctors tried to convince me it was asthma since I was 2 and a half, I'm 47 now, the so-called asthma goes off when it wants to, inhailers, asthma medications, breathing treatments, zip. No defense. In and out of the emergency room with 'uncontrolled asthma' pattern wise every 17 days for steroids today it is day 24 without an ER trip. I found theanine by accident and went to Nootropics Depot and got 200 mgs without the caffine, (found it in a C4 energy drink and tried to figure out why it worked). I take 3 in the morning at 8 am and 3 more if the symptoms return will try to go down if I can and plan on trying apigenin and even palmitoylethanolamide if necessary, as all the others never worked for me. KEEP searching PLEASE. For me this is an almost 20 year search. Medical Doctors are baffled and throw steroids at me, nutrotionists throw up their hands, so here's to hoping.",1691804740,jvtej5j,t3_10yqrt3,t3_10yqrt3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Kratom_Dumper,"Thanks, I looked it over and have bought some of those things, very interesting site. One thing that confuses me is that for example curcumin is both in the ""avoid/bad"" and ""good/mast cell stabilizers"". How am I suppossed to know if I should or should not use curcumin?  


It is a very good site for natural supplements but it doesn't go into nootropics, peptides or medications. So still not sure what I should take which kind of nootropics, peptides and medications.  


And I still don't know what I should do regarding IN bromantane and IM cerebrolysin because in your link it says.

""Nerve growth factor (NGF) can activate of mast cells. R  
NGF stimulates histamine release and sensitizes transient receptor potential V1 (TrpV1), which may cause histamine-induced itching""  


And if I am understanding it correctly, both cerebrolysin and bromantane increases NGF but at the same time it does a lot of other possible positive things.  


Hoping you or someone else can give an answer to this",1676093430,j82uv16,t3_10yqrt3,t1_j802qx8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,"Cerebro and Bromantane dont increase NGF very strongly, the main one to avoid wrt NGF is Lions Mane. Curcumin has both negative and positive effects wrt histamine so ymmv, only can see how it impacts you.",1676138572,j851grb,t3_10yqrt3,t1_j82uv16,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Kratom_Dumper,"Alright, so do you think it would be smart to continue with cerebrolysin and bromantane? Noticed a very clear reduction in neuroinflammation after 2 days with 10ml per day of Cerebrolysin.

Any other thing you recommend to try?

 Amlexanox looks interesting but seems hard to find",1676139267,j8537jy,t3_10yqrt3,t1_j851grb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,"Yeah for sure if its helping you, IN CBD is really great for neuroinflammation too: https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product/nasadol-biospectrum-cbd-nasal-spray-extra-strength-10ml/",1676169464,j86z5wz,t3_10yqrt3,t1_j8537jy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
