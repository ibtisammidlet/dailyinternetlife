I have been doing some research on different nootropics, supplements and medications that have mast cell stabilizing effect or have some other positive effects on mast cells. These are:

\- High dose Vitamin D   
\- Cromolyn  
\- Amlexanox  
\- PEA ( Palmitoylethanolamide)  
\- Selank  
\- KPV  
\- Melatonin (I wonder if this is the case for the medication agomelatine as well)  
\- Thymosin Alpha 1 (Seems to help but not sure how)  
\- Quercetin  
\- DHT, DHT-derivates like Winstrol  


There are probably some other I can't remember and also the standard ones like anti-histamines.  


I am curious if there are other nootropics, peptides, supplements and medications that you guys would recommend that can help MCAS by stabilizing mast cells or help in some other way?  


I am currently taking IM Cerebrolysin 10ml for 10 days (on day 5) which seems to have lowered my neuroinflammation but at the same time triggered some mast cells, could that be because it increases NGF? [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24674674/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24674674/) If yes, what would the best way to deal with cerebrolysin?  


I am also taking IN bromantane which seems to help but it depends a lot on how my MCAS is. I also saw that bromantane affects NGF and I am wondering what impact bromantane could have MCAS? Could it be possible be better to quit both Cerebrolysin and bromantane and then start it again once I am on some mast cell stabilizers?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Best nootropics, peptides, supplements and medications for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome? And which nootropics to avoid?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10yqrt3/best_nootropics_peptides_supplements_and/
