I tried, but can't find. I was also wandering about agmatine metabolism to spermidine, how much etc. Thanks",False,t5_4aoxhu,Agmatine bioavailability,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10y0gqt/agmatine_bioavailability/

Phenylalanine is an amino acid that can be converted into tyrosine and then into dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, which are neurotransmitters that activate the cAMP signaling pathway.

Activation of the cAMP signaling pathway by phenylalanine can increase the release of glutamate, which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Glutamate activates NMDA receptors, which increase the synaptic strength of neurons and lead to an increase in brain activity and CMRO2.

In conclusion, phenylalanine has been shown to increase the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) by increasing the release of glutamate and activating the cAMP signaling pathway. This increase in CMRO2 can be important in conditions such as stroke or cerebral ischemia, where it can play a role in improving brain function and recovery. However, caution should be used when administering phenylalanine as it can have adverse effects if taken in large doses.
