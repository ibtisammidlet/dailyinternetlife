ConnorGoFuckYourself,"In my experience (in combination with ADHD medications),  N-acetyl-l-tyrosine typically carries a heavier body load, whereas phenylalanine is much better tolerated.

NALT at the same dose as phenylalanine would cause profuse sweating, slight agitation and a high heart rate.

Phenylalanine typically wouldn't have anywhere near the same issues unless a quite high dose was consumed.

I want to say NALT didn't seem too bad with methylphenidate, but with Lisdexamfetamine it was rather unpleasant (I could be misremembering, I would suggest avoiding combining either).

One thing about NALT is it tastes surprisingly good, like very sour and quite sweet all at once.

Now of course the acetyl group could cause this change but I cannot say for sure.",1675872714,j7pyfql,t3_10wtvi3,t1_j7p6v8c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
