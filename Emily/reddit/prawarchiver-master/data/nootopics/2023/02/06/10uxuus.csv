Turbulent_Zone_5324,"I honestly wouldn’t be taking Phentermine at all. Way too taxing on the heart (that’s why it’s prescribed for a maximum of three months).

For weightloss, aside from the obvious ‘’just’ restrict caloric intake’, you’d be better off taking/injecting GLP-1 agonists like [Semaglutide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993760/) if you have the money for it. Semaglutide and TAK-653 can be taken together safely, according to their mechanisms.

Even though Phentermine (TAAR1 agonist) and TAK-653 (AMPA-PAM) don’t have overlapping mechanisms of action, they’re both CNS stimulants (Phentermine being much stronger than TAK), so I wouldn’t risk it. IF you were to still take both, I’d advise starting with the 15mg caps of Phentermine Hydrochloride.

Other amphetamine derivatives like Adderall have a better, and more well-known/studied, safety profile (also a TAAR1 agonist) and supresses hunger too. Take this with [caution](https://www.addysafe.org) as well, as Adderall can be highly addictive and neuro-/cardiotoxic too. 

Hope this helps.",1675702668,j7gg5ad,t3_10uxuus,t3_10uxuus,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
