Perhaps, I should probably consult with my doctor before doing any of this, but I would like your opinion first. I know many of us might not be medical professionals or experts in chemistry. However, we can certainly say we are sort of scientists, right? We like to experiment with ourselves by consuming a wide variety of nootropics. We have the same goalsâ€” to become more focused, more smart, and more productive. 
I just started my journey with nootropics. I know I should be sharing anecdotes after more time, but I've been taking TAK-653 with PRL-8-53 since last Sunday. However, I don't think PRL-8-53 is for me. It makes my head feel really weird. So, my friend gave me these tablets from Mexico called acxion, which is phentermine 30mg over there. He said it made him feel quite active during the day, which also helped him lose some pounds, but he could only take them for 3 months. 
My question is: Do you think it would be wise to take phentermine with TAK-653? I would like to try it out because I want to feel way more active during the day and have the energy to go to the gym and lose some weight. Still, I don't want to stop taking TAK-653. It makes me feel pretty focused during classes and also very happy and calm the rest of the day.
Thank you for your time.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Phentermine with TAK-653,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/10uxuus/phentermine_with_tak653/
