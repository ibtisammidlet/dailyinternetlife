Upset_Scientist3994,It is said that effects what come out partially from epigenetic mechanisms for GABA system last 10 days minimum after you finish with Selank. But by many anecdotes even much more.,1703956603,kfkrr38,t3_18ugkyb,t3_18ugkyb,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,I’ve never had wd from either selank or na-selank. I’ve read some odd reports of people claiming their is a slight withdrawal .My body is sensitive to gaba anything rebound or withdrawal and I got zero after dosing up to a 1mg subq or equal nasal of both(not at the same time) never got the high people talked about but never had any wd either. Just positive effects.,1703950881,kfkczxu,t3_18ugkyb,t3_18ugkyb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"As far as I can get you can take week breaks off, so you save on costs. But this require enough long usage period so the effect actually takes impact which may not be imminent with drugs working with this way.",1704030661,kfp4418,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfkze5k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Selank works epigenetically to upregulate your GABA system. Not as direct agonist like benzos and booze to downregulate long term.

Selank effect may not be immediate and not direct dose-dependant. But also it means that once you get whatever subtle you get from it, it will last also after you finished of your usage of it.",1704030604,kfp3zzw,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfkzjcr,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"No
I’m sure it does to some extent but it has a long ass half life and it would be a slow taper that’s why I think I feel it honestly <30days after a cycle 
Edit I’m an idiot",1703992933,kfneuwc,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfkzjcr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,It shouldn’t you should really look into Memantine it would probably helps millions with or without the selank. Also subq brings amazing results way better then nasal. How close are you to the end of your taper are you,1703979178,kfmg5cl,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfkdvxn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
paulm19855,"Great ! That’s all I wanted to hear 
I was fearful stopping would Dow regulate it and near end of benzo taper 
The fact it can help upregulate is great 
Ordered the na selank version and be here in uk next week .
Rekon it will be useful when in acute withdrawls .",1704031667,kfp6279,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfp3zzw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

What’s thoughts on that ?",1704029072,kfp16re,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfmg5cl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"I have no clue what you mean, but Selank is totally non-addictive as its effect is not linear and not even dose-dependant and there is no need whatsoever to taper it away if you mean that with your reply. Just quit anytime, no withdrawal therefore it is availible over-the-counter in Russian pharmas.",1704031657,kfp61i3,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfp1bch,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,I can’t see it hurting any. Honestly yes use it. I would assume semax would be great towards the end of a benzo taper to rebuild cerebrolysin is like semax on crack lol I’d start is asap. Where did you source your btw,1704039987,kfppgi7,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfp16re,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

paulm19855,"I’m using bromantane also for dopamine and gaba t .
I started the bromantane in July when I started taper as I had just stopped vyvanse for adhd and needed something to upregulate dopamine that didn’t cause anxiety . 
Do you think stopping bromantane will have affect on gaba , and it’s gaba T it affects ? 

Have semax in fridge but not used yet . 
Aye thinking of the Cerebrolysin one months after acute withdrawl to start neurogensis .",1704040479,kfpqpzu,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfppgi7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
paulm19855,"So Cerebrolysin a good thing to start even tho not completely off benzos ? 
Like I’m on a very low dose 0.0625 mcg klonopin which is equal to 1mg Diaz . Be jumping next week I think .",1704040534,kfpqv3f,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfppgi7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,I’ve never noticed an issue stopping bromantane I take at least 50mg every day but I take weeks off and it’s just fine again I wouldn’t worry. I’d start with the cerebrolysin while tapering still how long are you projecting it to be till your taper is done?,1704041033,kfps5cy,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfpqpzu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Yes do this and if in the end you still feel off start a semax cycle but I bet you won’t need it.,1704041097,kfpsb7i,t3_18ugkyb,t1_kfpr3uw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Can you take Cerebrolysin with bromantane or selank ? Can’t find any info on this lol 

Just don’t wanna stop bromantane atm as dopamine still ain’t at a good level with all these addictive drugs I’ve tapered off in last years
