If regime could be something similar. Too bad nobody is making such elaborate posts anymore...

Upset_Scientist3994,"St. Johns Wort could be dropped if taking loads of other supplements.

Its mode-of-action is to affect certain liver enzymes, and it may nullify the effect of many other things in your stack it is said. Or mayby to enhance them into dangerous levels - not heard that but possible.

One doctor when briefly discussing about supplements warned about St Johns Wort in particular that it is tendencious to inflict liver damage in interactions with other substances.

But if you take it into clean head without anything else, then on-par or superior to SSRI mediciations.

One mode-of-action of it is that it contains amentoflavone what has bunch of cool effects, but Ginkgo Biloba has it too, so that can serve as replacement of St. Johns Wort for that certain part of its effects.

Since that plant or herb blooms in trenches and roadsides and meadows in many places here I used to gather and dry it and throw it into my stack. Not anymore after learning all this, so I have big bags of that thing dried perpetually unused. One thing of that herb is that if you pluck flowers of it when being fresh, skin in your hands gets purple spots where it touches or wherein phytochemicals are absorbed. And it wont go away when washing hands for couple days, and how your hands appear after picking one plastic bag full of that herb gives good scare for other people afterwards. Apparently phytochemicals are pretty strong in it, and issue with photosensitivity on your skin after using that should be taken seriously if their effects really is so colorful as I experienced.",1704032647,kfp81nj,t3_18towq1,t3_18towq1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,"Below 6mg it partially antagonizes opiate receptors for about two hours then the body responds by releasing 3x the normal endorphins. It can counteract the fatigue that APs naturally cause.

Crafty-Emu-769,what it has even higher affinity for than opioid receptors is TLR4 the antagonism of which reduces inflammation. also low doses are pretty good with opioids actually and help maintain higher chronic effects. 2-6mg might be a bit too much to just add right away if one has already been taking opioids for a while tho ofc.,1704020834,kfop39u,t3_18towq1,t1_kffk5yl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Selank mostly blocks the metabolization of enkaphalines, including endogenous opiates. For that reason partially it is being used in Russian pharmacology into opiate and alcholol treatment along other things. This mode-of-action should be non-addictive as such. 

That is part of Selank anxiolytic mechanism, but there are epigenetic things in it also to appear and last for long term.

Other substances to do the same are Semax peptide, and then D-phenylalanine present in D,L-Phenylalaine combo what comes out if you manufacture Phenylalanine synthetically (from foodstuffs you get only L-phenylalanine).",1704032051,kfp6te2,t3_18towq1,t1_kffn0or,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
