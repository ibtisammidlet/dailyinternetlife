Hello. I am currently suffering from side effects that began after I took two doses of three medications: Abilify, agotine, and topiramate. I took them for approximately a month and a half and abruptly stopped without tapering off.

Around two hours after the first doses, I felt an intense high, accompanied by agitation and hallucinations. I had never experienced such sensations before. People passing by also commented that I appeared as though I were under the influence of drugs.

From the second day onwards, I started bexperiencing severe issues. Firstly, I noticed a complete change in my mental state. It's difficult to explain, but it felt as though my mind had become flat. Previously, I was a musician and possibly an artist, but now I feel significantly worse, lacking any dynamism or character.

After that day, I began losing many things, including my memories, thoughts, feelings, and musical abilities (which used to be my greatest strength). I was an exceptional guitarist before, but now I can hardly play at all because the connection to sound and music has disappeared from within me. I felt my life was lost, I was completely lost, and I still have that feeling.

I have also developed tardive dyskinesia, which causes abnormal movements when I'm stressed (particularly in social situations). Additionally, I've experienced akathisia, short-term memory loss (to the extent that I can't remember what I saw just two seconds ago), and constant feelings of suicidal ideation. I also feel as though I've aged significantly and that life no longer holds any colors or impressions for me. Furthermore, I perceive that my facial appearance has changed in a negative manner.

In an attempt to find relief, I started purchasing numerous supplements based on information I gathered from various websites, mostly through anecdotal accounts. 

These are the supplements that I currently have :
Thorne - Niacinimide, 5htp, Iso-phos
Nootropics depot - Ashwaganda, uridine, vitamin E
Now - Ginkgo, NAC, L-tryptophan, Beta alanine
Life extention - PQQ, cistsanche

How should I take these supplements? Which ones should I take, at what dosages, and in which combinations and timings? 

I also have some supplements on the way, but I can't recall all of them anymore.

I am willing to do whatever it takes to heal. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
