Cat_Dabs,"I recommend storing nasal sprays in two Ziploc bags, with desiccant in each bag, in the refrigerator. I noticed when I was storing nasal sprays in the fridge they would grow bacteria around the spray nozzle, so I put it in the ziplock bag and it still started to appear after a while so I put in two ziplock bags and it never appeared. Also it doesn't hurt to use an alcohol swab on the nozzle before and after use.",1702938392,kdydd5u,t3_18lecaw,t3_18lecaw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Art_hur_Schopenhauer,"it is definitely a risk, no question about it. in fact not only cerebro is a risk and never without chances to contain some deadly-level bacteria but also every single day is a risk and not without chances of terrible bacteria overgrowth and/or death.

thedreamingmoon12,It can get contaminated this is why it’s important to A) order the smaller amps so they you going through a fresh amp relatively fast once it’s opened B) storing the sprayer in a baggie or two away from food. C) cleaning the sprayer including line after each amp. D) don’t share the sprayer,1702940668,kdyjbqe,t3_18lecaw,t3_18lecaw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
snAp5,I’d buy potassium sorbate or benzalkonium chloride if you’re making a nasal spray of that stuff. It goes foul pretty quickly.,1702941226,kdykpvp,t3_18lecaw,t3_18lecaw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ImpressiveAd6357,"I put about 1% Benzyl alcohol in my nasal sprays. It’s a bacteriostatic preservative and typically used for this purpose, as far as I know.

And make sure you use sterile water when mixing your nasal spray, in case it’s not pre-mixed.",1702967700,ke07ed0,t3_18lecaw,t3_18lecaw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Bacterial growth is very unlikely unless it’s a dirty nasal sprayer. That said if you have an autoimmune issue then Cere can potentially trigger an issue by its effect on Toll-Like receptors. Also rare but possible,1703701482,kf5k9l9,t3_18lecaw,t3_18lecaw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Sharp-Huckleberry862,"There’s a risk to eating anything, any food you consume has a chance of having a deadly bacteria that kills you.

stinkykoala314,"I thought about doing this, but was worried that this would denature the proteins in the Cerebrolysin. Have you done this with cere specifically, and if so, do you notice any difference in efficacy?",1703181516,kecon1l,t3_18lecaw,t1_ke07ed0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Art_hur_Schopenhauer,"i was just kidding brother. it is 99.9% far fetched. it was just weird to me that fear neurosis is growing too much.  nothing terrible will happen to you even with contaminated cerebro which is by itself probably a very very rare thing. nobody will die from it. worst very rare case scenario is some kind of infection that will pass.  the whole point. it is absolutely not worth your anxieties, fears, concerns, contemplations, ruminations over and over again.. as it is the case with basically all big fears/anxieties.  but one can't do much about it whatever he says, it is a pretty damn stable tendency of psyche/personality.  that's sad.  waste of life quality on so much fears that have so little chance to happen.  even if chances are big, high anxiety/concerns/fear is useless.  problems without redemption, problems of human condition.    but what do i know, do what you like",1703214547,kef08pn,t3_18lecaw,t1_kedzsow,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
