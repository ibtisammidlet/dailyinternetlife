Upset_Scientist3994,"L-carnosine is said to chelate heavy metals. It is apparently part of its function as endogenous neuroprotectant.

Alpha-lipoic acid, or preferably R-lipoic acid is said to do the same thing too.

But those are for input of new heavy metals what you consume, that is different how to get out something what is inside your tissues and mayby is not moving naturally anywhere from there.

Your choice should align with your desired mental state. If you're seeking a nootropic that promotes relaxation and a sense of calm, Bacopa monnieri is the ideal choice. It's known for its soothing properties, which can help in reducing stress and enhancing mental clarity. On the other hand, if you prefer a nootropic that provides a more stimulating and uplifting effect, 7,8-DHF would be more suitable",1703618318,kf0sjl7,t3_18rd8xk,t3_18rd8xk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
