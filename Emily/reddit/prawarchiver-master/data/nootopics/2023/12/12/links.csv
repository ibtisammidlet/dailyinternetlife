I've recently been getting more and more interested in nootropics and i've ordered a few myself, particularly the racetams, however insufflation/nasal sprays, especially nasal sprays, spark my curiosity. I've got a few questions about them, and i'd love to hear people's experiences with insufflation/nasal sprays if you guys have any

1. Is it irritating long-term to the mucous membranes? What about nasal sprays, same thing? Is it fine to take occasionally in that case or best to avoid it entirely?
2. How effective/fast is this method of administration?
3. How much would i need to decrease the dosage from oral/sublingual, roughly? (I know this can depend significantly since each substance is different, but is there any sort of estimate i can go off of like ""x times less weight""?)
4. Not really related to insufflation but: What are some other effective fast methods of administration that have worked very well (or just as well) for you, if you've got any experience with them? (Note: personally sublingual hasnt worked too well, or fast, at all)
