TitosII,"Not nootropic, I used this for a year  when I had some issues with heart, when using it found great performance increase like running or doing any intensive activity easier than before, it's good to mention that this is considered doping for athletes.",1702421683,kd3ppef,t3_18gsmtn,t3_18gsmtn,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"I'm currently trying Trimetazidine, the MOA is very similar to meldonium. Mainly because of this study in healthy volunteers:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28626744/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28626744/)

In short, it seems to have some modafinil-like effects in healthy volunteers. I have been experimenting with it for a couple of weeks and there is definitely a *very* clean uptick in vigilance. Nothing like (ar)modafinil or stims, this stuff feels much more natural. Further advantages are that it's easier to obtain than mentioned compounds and is quite cheap. I will probably write an experience report about it soon.

Although plausible, I have no idea if meldonium would produce similar effects though.",1702552178,kdb25nd,t3_18gsmtn,t3_18gsmtn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
