I gradually increased to around 1200mg, which triggered the darkest form of suicidal depression I have ever experienced. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through that again! It made me believe the only way out of the darkness was to end myself. 

It was so terrifying that I no longer take choline supplements at all, not even with my racetams (aniracetam) in case it triggers another depressive episode. I don't recall having a headache since then, but even if I did, I wouldn't go near a choline supplement again.

In case anyone wonders where I get my dietary choline from I follow a carnivore diet and consume liver daily in small doses to get my choline.

To make matters more confusing, I also cannot take L-Tyrosine anymore. It used to work well as part of my preworkout stack dosed at 500mg and helped with anxiety and focus for work. However, after the Alpha GPC-induced depression, L-Tyrosine would focus me at the gym (taken on an empty stomach) in the morning, but then I would progressively become depressed and moody after, although not as severely as with the Alpha GPC. Thank God! It would only last about a day. 

All that being said, I have read positive things about Uridine and ALCAR, and even better things about stacking the two together. They seem to benefit verbal fluency and make for a great pre-workout addition. I have researched extensively on Reddit and YouTube, and it seems that both can have anywhere from neutral to amazing effects. I have heard that Uridine can be used indefinitely and helps promote neurogenesis, making it great for language acquisition. ALCAR I believe can also be used indefinitely which make both ideal for my work and training. 

My only concern is that I have read one or two comments about people experiencing depression with either nootropics. These comments are in the minority and are overshadowed by the positive literature and videos, but it still gives me pause for concern.

ALCAR increases acetylcholine synthesis, which could be concerning for someone who don't do well with high levels of choline. On the other hand, Uridine, from what I have read, partly converts to AcetylCholine, raising similar concerns as mentioned for ALCAR.

If I have any of this science wrong, please correct me.

My question is: given my predisposition to choline depression, do you think it's worthwhile for me to try Uridine or ALCAR, or both, as part of my daily work stack?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Is ALCAR or Uridine a good idea if I am prone to choline depression?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18uooc1/is_alcar_or_uridine_a_good_idea_if_i_am_prone_to/
