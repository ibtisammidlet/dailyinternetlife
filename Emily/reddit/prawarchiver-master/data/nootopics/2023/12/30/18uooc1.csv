Upset_Scientist3994,"There was elsewhere in Reddit hypothesis on choline precursor induced depression on the idea, that free choline somewhat interacts with alpha7 acetylcholine receptor already and problem is connected with that. Acetylcholine goes to all receptors simultaneosly, and some of them like alpha4 make you feel strong in the nerves or at least balance the effect out. 

This would explain why choline precursors make people typically melancholic, but then again something like Coluracetam what sucks choline into cells effectively in order to turn it into acetylcholine to boost its levels works against even treatment resistant depression. Because free choline from blood is taken away at faster rate into acetylcholine form what acts differently. 

For me those wild guesses and hypotheses sound like something of a plausible explanation for paradoxic mystery of this. 

ALCAR is no precursor of choline, taking it does not increase free choline in bloodstream. But it may act similarly getting free choline out from your blood more rapid rate in order to turn it into acetylcholine. Generally there is much less reports on choline depression on ALCAR rather than from choline precursor forms.",1704105761,kfti94y,t3_18uooc1,t3_18uooc1,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

The_Advocates_Devil_,"Great explanation!

So you essentially want to remove the free choline to prevent it from acetalizing in the wrong place or overloading on the nerves.

This makes me think that if you did have a problem with ALCAR you could always stack it with a racetam to prevent any possible depression. That would preclude it from an everyday stack which is what I am searching for.
