,"Phenylpiracetam - it improves mental focus and physical performance for example a heavy set of 10 on squats feels like a walk in the park. Lung capacity improves and I don‚Äôt over exert on it, heartbeat seems to be more stable under physical stress. Also seems to make me stress resistant whether physical or mental, another thing I noticed is that I don‚Äôt feel cold or warm on it. Overall it‚Äôs my favourite !",1703082012,ke6k4uo,t3_18mveo0,t3_18mveo0,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Murky_Expression_938,"Phenylpiracetam, i just use a 5mg scoop full, put under the tounge and i feel the effect, more alert, my brain work better, i'm more focused, i'm in 5 days in a row no tolerance....if I encrease the amount I think i'm going to encreise the effect but for me is good like this, i want to use daily...the effect last few hours, I did a full 5mg scoop 3 times, sometims i add 5mg of noopept, but i think PP is more powerful.

when I use it I go out and stay out so i cannot redose, I think if i bring the jar with me i'm going to redose too often, so i want to stick to 3 dose of pheny and if i want a bit more push i can add some noopept

I was surprised this ittle amount has a good effect, i'm more talktive, it was what  looking for, i feel more secure in social contest, I feel smarter...I'm less dumber :-)

I hope this daily routine continue for long time and hope no side effect because I feel smarter

fasoractam make me tired, i get it a bit one time beetwen dosing of PP

I have coluracetam and oxiracetam and aniracetam, but didn't take those at moment, it was a purchase did a year ago, and now I just want to retry, and phenyl is good in this way, it can be placebo? I don't think so because are few days in a row, usually after 2 o 3 days i feel normal, but at the moment i feel the push...let's see

one thing i notice I talk more loudly and I have more disinibition, and even more generosity, one night i pay few drinks and spent more money than usual...I don't have the usual brake on things",1703102982,ke84y6k,t3_18mveo0,t3_18mveo0,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

In fact most of them make my executive functioning worse. Fasoracetam is unique in that while it‚Äôs not a stimulant, it seems to truly get to the bottom of my executive functioning issues. With time it improves my ability to sustain attention, plan and organize. It also improves my working memory, sense of time and emotional control. I believe my executive dysfunction stems from some type of mGluR mutation as Fasoracetam is more effective for me (in most ways) than FDA approved medication. Although Fasoracetam still has its downsides. It can be somewhat anxiogenic when first starting it. It doesn‚Äôt provide much of any mental energy or motivation. It also noticeably blunts my orgasms.
