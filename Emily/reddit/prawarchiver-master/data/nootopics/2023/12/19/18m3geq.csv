PossibleDirection524,"I know for me, it's much easier to dose something like that once it's in solution. 

Bromantane is lipid soluble, so I put 1.5 grams into 30ml of olive oil, then I can dose 50mg/ml with a dropper. 

It's an absolute must-have for me before the gym now. It makes all the difference in the world. Most days I'll take 50mg in the AM (5-6am-ish) to get my butt in gear, then another 50mg about 30 minutes before I go to the gym (anywhere from 3-5pm depending on the day). 

I would definitely take it slow getting started out. Took me a couple days to get used to it, and it can cause some insomnia at first. 

Good luck, have fun, and I hope I can be just like you when I grow up!",1702998902,ke1lw0l,t3_18m3geq,t3_18m3geq,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
icyeconomics42069,try co q10 ubiquinol and NAD+ liposomal. Also take TMG with it as it depletes methylgroups. For energy,1703010224,ke2grsz,t3_18m3geq,t3_18m3geq,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

StrikingCheesecake69,"I had quite a unique experience with insuffalated bromantane.  The effects have lasted for months.  Coming from my personal experience, I can only recommend trying a 3-5 day cycle (one 5-10mg insuff dose per day) and then give yourself at least 2 weeks to really get an idea of whether or not it has had an effect.  It upregulates the enzymes responsible for dopamine synthesis.  Goes much further than just primary receptor effects (how most drugs work)",1702998436,ke1kpnc,t3_18m3geq,t3_18m3geq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"Wow, thanks for the quick reply and good suggestions! On thing I wanted to make sure I am understanding correctly is do you hold your olive oil bromantane solution sublingually for a while or just swallow the drops? 

Another thanks for the comment about being just like me when you grow up! Although, I hope you are way better than me when that happens! And actually, I am still trying to grow up and hope to be way better myself!",1702999599,ke1noui,t3_18m3geq,t1_ke1lw0l,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

DrBobMaui,"I really appreciate the quick reply and will take your cycle advice to heart. One thing though, I cannot do insuffalated so would you have any specific suggestion for the amount I should start with doing it sublingually? No problem if not as it may not be something that you can easily compare dose amounts.

DrBobMaui,"Well, you got me thinking about insuffalating as I like the idea and using less bromantane would be great too. So I wanted to ask, does it irritate your sinus at all? I am assuming that you insuffalate just the powder, right?",1703850086,kfegqsa,t3_18m3geq,t1_ke1kpnc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PossibleDirection524,"Oh sorry! Guess I should have clarified. 

I actually use empty Capsules. Just dump 1ml of the solution in a ""00"" sized capsule and down the hatch. You could probably get away with it sublingual. I've just never tried it myself. I HAVE used a bromantane nasal spray, but I seem to respond better to taking it orally.",1702999927,ke1ojg9,t3_18m3geq,t1_ke1noui,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
