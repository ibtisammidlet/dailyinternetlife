I hope you will give me some suggestions as to how to start using it. I am a 77yr old ancient ager and have a great diet, work out, have had good results with ""noots"" especially with microdosing. My main objective with bromantane would be getting a little more physical energy. So here's my quick questions:

1. What would be a good starting dose and should I begin with just once per day or do more? I understand that it's best to start with a morning dose.

2. I have read that it might be good to take it with olive or MCT oil? I do good with sublingual and have no problem holding it for 20 minutes if needed, with or without oil? I don't do well with nasal because of some severe nasal damage so that's out for me.

3. I enjoy a light caffeine drink in the morning, would it be okay to keep doing that with bromantane?

4. Are there any other supplements and/or tips, that you would suggest with my bromantane dosing?

Big thanks in advance for any suggestions. And big alohas and all the best to all my Nootopics friends too!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane Powder Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18m3geq/bromantane_powder_questions/
