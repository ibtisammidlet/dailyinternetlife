smartscience,Didn't NSI-189 fail a Phase 2? That still remains popular though! What were the exact details of the presumed failure? Did it still meet any secondary endpoints?,1703279251,keiik2e,t3_18ol4rj,t3_18ol4rj,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

sanpedro12,yeah I have read about it. its commonly used in research but I am not sure if it is currently used in human trials,1703324169,kel2sc6,t3_18ol4rj,t1_kekzgbv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Curious_Estate_5550,It is being use in trials but hasnt come out as something to do your own research...I Guess if you can buy It might be worth it,1703324466,kel391i,t3_18ol4rj,t1_kel2sc6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Curious_Estate_5550,"it means that the inhibitor forms a long-lasting or permanent bond with the FAAH enzyme, altering its structure in a way that is not easily reversible. In the case of an irreversible inhibitor like URB597, the effects on FAAH activity are more sustained and persistent.",1703364876,kennp99,t3_18ol4rj,t1_kenmazr,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
roof_lurker,How long does this “permanent” change last in a persons system? Thank you for answering and pardon my ignorance. Are we talking like a permanent/life time effect or just a strong binding affinity?,1703391045,kep9mtg,t3_18ol4rj,t1_kennp99,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

However, genomically, you will produce more of the enzyme to counter endogenous (or Exogenous) substrates over time.",1703480444,ketxcfn,t3_18ol4rj,t1_kep9mtg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
