If you’re looking to improve your own stress response to it then using things that influence cortisol and reduces dopamine will likely lessen any sort of emotional reactions. Ashwaghanda here might prove useful, I don’t recommend it often.  

If being depressive is causal in how you experience these emotional reactions then using something to treat the depression and get you interested in other things may work. It could also do the opposite and make you more emotional or aggressive. Only way to know is to try.
