Reasonable_Dot_1831,"St Johns wort, SAM-e, Agmatine, Emoxypine, Huperzine A

I can recommend all of those, and they worked also really for me. Try each of them alone, and see what works for you. I can send you also studies for each of them, they are proven to be effective.

St John's wort and Sam-e are at least as effective as prescription meds. And for me they have zero side effects.

Tianeptine is also great, I have a prescription for it.

The general opinion here on reddit is very negative. It's sold in the US as ""gas station"" heroin. The pills are heavily overdosed, and then the people blame tianeptine for being dangerous.",1703661338,kf3fumw,t3_18rslip,t3_18rslip,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

LaoBen,"Omberacetam ? Other name for noopept ?
In my experience noopept is pretty mild in terms of mood boost and motivation. I use it regularly to increase my verbal fluency and my focus capacity at work. But it provides a robot-like feeling, it dulls the emotional field.
You get less distracted by emotions I would say.
The thing I like to combine with racetams is mitragina, that plant is exceptional for mood, anxiety and motivation, but it's very addictive, so big warning, do your research, and it's often illegal. It can mess up your dopamine system.",1703664021,kf3jii8,t3_18rslip,t3_18rslip,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

la_alchemista,"On St.John’s Wort: this is a fabulous plant tincture that I take on and off for a boot in serotonin. My protocol is as needed, but have taken it for 2 weeks 1-2 times a day and then off for one to two weeks and then from there I went down to one dose every other day. That did the trick for me. I also paired it with mindfulness practice and journaling my feelings freely. *I don’t suggest taking this plant if you are on any medications as it is unsafe for several reasons.

Collationem,"What is your experience with HupA specifically? I've been going back and forth with AchE inhibitors but they seem to have highly unpredictable effects for me. I would also like to know whether (you think) the NMDA antagonism of HupA is clinically relevant (it may account for the mood boosting effects you describe, but would also obviously be anti-nootropic).",1705153266,khnz059,t3_18rslip,t1_kf3fumw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Reasonable_Dot_1831,"Nope, it's total bullshit. Here in Europe it's a normal prescription medicine, I have even the prescription for it and take it since 3 years, 3 x12.5mg per day. You can get it quite easy and I see here no abuse at all.

I never had the urge to take more, and once I even stopped 2 weeks without any big withdrawals.

The main problem in the US is the fentanyl Opiod crisis and that tianeptine is being sold heavily overdosed at gas stations.

Guess what will happen if you take 1000mg instead of 3x12,mg?

It's 26 times the dose of the official recommendation, of course you will have fatal side effects!",1703661553,kf3g5lq,t3_18rslip,t1_kf37jhp,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheGiantess927,Kratom? It’s only illegal in a few states and that’s bc of blatant stupidity. I also question this Reddit idea that it’s addictive. At low doses and using only crushed leaf or tea (as nature intended) and not the gas station shit I see addiction potential as low.,1703673575,kf3vvlh,t3_18rslip,t1_kf3jii8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
