Legitimate_Banana512,"About to buy, but.. 

You gotta pair it with Berberine.

Cause kappa antagonism on neurons appears to be fine, but kappa antagonism also targets microglial cells, which inhibit it from repressing inflamatory signals (thus cause dopaminergic dysfunction)


Berberine can inhibit NLRP3, which likely counters this

Also, 7,8-dhf could work. Patients immune to antidepressent efficiency might lack trkb signaling response",1703670014,kf3ram4,t3_18ro9xi,t3_18ro9xi,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

I don't know but I think it cause similar opioid downregulation over time as opioid agonists like (oxycodone, kratom etc.) 

Other said It could be caused by upregulation of Kappa receptors (dysphoric) by LDN. 

But on the other hand high dose Lions Mane (Kappa opioid agonist) also cause permament anhedonia, DPDR etc. Which don't make sense. 




I wanted to try LDN for my Anhedonia but now It seems like kratom couple times a month may be even safer to feel normal sometimes.
