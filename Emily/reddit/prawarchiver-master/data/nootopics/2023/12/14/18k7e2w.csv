Wellyeahso,"I have never heard of Huperazine-A affecting stimulant euphoria before. I am having difficulty finding information about this. Do you have any links you can share, or avenues of search that may lead me to understand how this mechanism could work?",1703003125,ke1x1jv,t3_18k7e2w,t3_18k7e2w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Accurate_Tough8382,"I do not have any source to this besides my own experience, but I'm starting to think that on the days I take Bromantane, my stimulants are less effective. I thought it would help it, which was one reason I wanted to try it. But I have to pay closer attention to what days I take it and how I feel.",1703006649,ke26qor,t3_18k7e2w,t3_18k7e2w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Just know combining stimulants like this is playing mad science with your neurochemistry.   If you do, lower your doses.",1703433135,ker23o2,t3_18k7e2w,t3_18k7e2w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I have seen this post and I needed better effects of same dosage because of tolerance. Then I have seen huperzine on this post & I have tried it. 

Unfortunately the dexamphe doesnt last 8h+ anymore for me, but with huperzine it is 6h with euphoria. I never redose after the 6h so I cant say anything about that. 

This smhw doesn't help with methylphenidate tolerance!

I took 200micrograms , but u should take that only every second day, otherwise u get headache because of too much acetylcholine. Maybe 100 micrograms have the same effect, i dont know.
