why shouldn't bromantane be combined with dexamphetamine/dexedrine? Is the combination too overwhelming?

When I take Huperzine A with Dexedrine, the euphoria comes back and the effects are much better.

I know the two substances are completely different, but what I'm trying to say with this sentence is shouldn't a lower dosage of Dexamphe prevent the ""overstimulation""? I want the Dexedrine to be more intense!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Question about bromantane with dexamphe,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18k7e2w/question_about_bromantane_with_dexamphe/

Are the peptides like BPC 157 and Ipamorelin offered at Everychem really stable at room temp?  If so how?  I thought they had to be stored in the fridge,False,t5_4aoxhu,EveryChem Peptides Stable at Room Temp?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18icrzw/everychem_peptides_stable_at_room_temp/
