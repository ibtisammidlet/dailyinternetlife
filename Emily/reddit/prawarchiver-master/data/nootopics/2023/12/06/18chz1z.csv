ArcticPlatypus,"I had that experience on all antipsychotics I’ve ever been on. Latuda is an antipsychotic, and while they all differ a bit in mechanism, they generally just antagonize (block) a bunch of receptors. Just looked at Latuda and it appears to block less receptors than many other antipsychotics, but still strongly blocks dopamine D2, serotonin 2A, serotonin 7, and mildy blocks the alpha-2-c adrenergic receptors. 
I’ve never been on Latuda but other antipsychotics made me feel numbed out and unable to feel much of anything. Other substances didn’t work anywhere near as well. 

I think the only thing that ultimately resolves the issue is getting off the antipsychotic. You can exercise a shitload and do cold showers and try to take things to counteract the medication but overall it makes sense that it’s blocking the ability to feel substances.",1701923226,kcbru6q,t3_18chz1z,t3_18chz1z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,I had this experience with Seroquel blocking a lot of the effects of stimulants and nootropics. The answer to the problem is to taper off the antipsychotic they can really mess up your dopamine receptors causing movement disorders if your brain adapts to them. Another word of advice would be to take some tyrosine on an empty stomach and it can help get a little magic back in the meantime,1701936825,kccc453,t3_18chz1z,t3_18chz1z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DiegPosts,"Antipsychotics reduce dopamine serotinin, other neurotransmitters which makes your brain run slower but prevents you from having extreme mood swings/thoughts. 

Not healthy really, you need to find a balance if you feel its making you dumb. Too high of a dose or the wrong medicine can be antinootropic.",1702257004,kcud7an,t3_18chz1z,t3_18chz1z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
default_user_10101,"Ughh ya this is what I figured. I hate being stuck on this medication, I've had trouble feeling dull and slow before them but now my thoughts are even more blank and I can't even escape it through nootropics like I use to anymore because of what you've outline. Very frustrating. thanks for giving me this clarity at least.",1701923480,kcbsbdl,t3_18chz1z,t1_kcbru6q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
AromaticPlant8504,You forgot D1 which it blocks more strongly than D2,1702004130,kcgaa04,t3_18chz1z,t1_kcbru6q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Oh what, they can do that? How?

Like in a similar way as stimulants (agonist instead of dopamine antagonist) can do? Or worse?",1701972781,kce6vni,t3_18chz1z,t1_kccc453,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DiegPosts,Try reducing dose if you can. Just make sure your behavior says well,1702257711,kcueu0d,t3_18chz1z,t1_kcbsbdl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
