JeebieWeebie14,"Go to a doctor get bloodwork, test hormones, talk to your doc about the physical symptoms. You got some sort of physical ailment or infection. Nootropic probably aren’t the solution here.",1701997569,kcfv8au,t3_18ct2wm,t3_18ct2wm,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Accurate_Tough8382,"I am prescribed 70mg vyvanse, 10mg dexadrine, 50mg prozac, tirzepatide, and 8mg or less suboxone, a day. I have realized and will talk to my dr, but vyvanse has started making me really sleepy. The dex works so much better. Also, that is what I am prescribed. I also buy adderall from friends and take a bunch a day because I'm soooo tired all of the time. But what has helped tremendously is that I started researching peptides and nootropics. I also had a hormone test and showed that they are all very low, which explains why I'm tired. 

2 months ago I tried Noopept and for the first time in 3 years I noticed that was happy to be outside.  Because for 3 years I have wanted nothing but to be in bed all day and night every day. However, I also had not taken any stimulants in 2 weeks and that day was when I started back on a low dose. I've never felt that euphoria from Noopept again but it's still helped me stay out of the 3 year depression that I didn't even realize I was in. 

Here is my current stack.
All of the above plus
Noopept 1-4 times a week
Aniracetam 4-5 days a week
Mic B12 twice a week
Semax Nasal 
Ghk-cu nasal- 2-4 a week
Sabroxy 1-6 times a week 
Acetyl L carnitine 1 per day
Oxiracetam-ehh just whenever I have not felt anything from it but I just keep trying lol
Acetyl L-tyrosine 1 a day
Methylfolate 1 a day
Pregnanolone 1 per day

These I have been taken for about 2 years and they helped me during my time of the month. 
Magnesium bisglycinate every night
Magnesium glycinate at Night
Magnesium citrate at night
Sometimes Magnesium threonate- after taking I wake up in the morning and feel like I  finally breathed through the night.  Not meaning like I was congested and it helped clear it. I mean like a weight was finally lifted off of me at night while I slept. And I didn't have that pressure in my lungs that apparently I didn't realize had been there before lol
Tumeric at night
Vitamin C at night


I have tried mots-c, AOD, epitalon, Oxytocin, Ipamorelin, cortagen. 
I was taking cortagen when I took the Noopept that day too. 

I'm have Cerebrolysin and cortexin that I'm waiting to start and try. 
And I also and about to try dL-phenylalanine. 

Other things I'll be trying out
Agmatine
L-glutathione 



I don't know what is working and what's not so I just keep on taking it because I feel like myself again for the first time in 3 years",1702000015,kcg0u99,t3_18ct2wm,t3_18ct2wm,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Pookykowa,"Your age, the visual disturbances, and the anhedonia would make me at least wonder about a possible psychotic disorder in an early (prodromal) stage.  Men who go on to develop a psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, etc) often begin to get symptoms of psychosis (such as visual disturbances) in early 20s and they may worsen until they result in a psychotic break.  Anhedonia can be part of the clinical picture.  (You also mentioned the visual disturbances worsening).  The smells you mention may in fact be real smells—or they could be partly imagined or exaggerated by your mind.  Psychotic disorders involve dysfunction in the dopamine system so this may be why dopaminergic meds like stimulants are particularly effective, at least for the anhedonia.  Do they make the visual disturbances worse, I wonder?  Stimulants can worsen psychotic symptoms, so be careful with them!

Im not a doctor, and what I’m saying doesn’t obviously explain your physical symptoms, but I’d make sure my medical providers and psychologist knew about these visual symptoms you’re describing. I’m sure your psychologist has also done a family history to see if you’re at a heightened risk for schizophrenia etc.

On the other hand—the mild hallucinations you describe don’t always have anything to do with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, etc.  Something like 10 percent of the population has occasional hallucinations as part of their everyday experience, so it’s not always pathological!  But I would keep the possibility of a developing mental health disorder on my radar!",1702092642,kcl9l6b,t3_18ct2wm,t3_18ct2wm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Anhedonic97,"Thank you, i have been to a doctor now and my thyroid hormones are fine, tsh 1 and free t4 21, testosterone is kind of low within normal range though and bioactive t was normal. I have been on t once before on my own in high doses and felt no improvement so i kind of doubt its that.

Crp and sr was low also, but i feel like i have a huge inflammation everywhere.. Doing keto since 3w hoping it could starve mold/candida if its that. Pain has lowered a little from ketosis so far, but not the fatigue or the other symptoms. Cervical issues also on my to check list

kittensbabette,"I was insanely tired when I was on Suboxone - It was a battle to get up every morning (well it would usually end up being afternoon by the time I got up) some days I literally got up to eat and then I'd go back to bed and just sleep. Since going off it, I'm now waking up at 8 am whether I like it or not...I didn't realize it was a Suboxone symptom until I got off, I just thought I wasn't a morning person!

Anhedonic97,"Thank you so much for your time and help! I dont think thats it because its only the visual thing(very mild only see it when i try to detect it) i think it might be brain damage or some other consequence of my past drug use. I dont feel psychotic ever except on high doses of amphetamine when i used to do that. Even then i usually get that its just in my head. Maybe however could be bipolar.

But im leaning more towards chronic fatigue syndrome, mold/other toxin, cervical issues or some other similar condition which makes me feel depressed because i feel sick all the time.",1703510358,keuz7g5,t3_18ct2wm,t1_kcl9l6b,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Anhedonic97,"Thank you so much for your time! I have done some blood work now and will soon meet the doctor again for follow up. could it still be that when my crp and sr came back low? 

Im thinking could it be me/cfs? Mold/candida/other toxin? Cervical issues(neck pain is constant and stiff muscles but its like part of the pain is deeper than the muscles are, like its inside the spine)

Other things i have in the back of my head is lupus, Epstein barr, cancer, cushings syndrome, addisons, etc..
