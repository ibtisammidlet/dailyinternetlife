26Male
On 18mg buprenorphine and 40mg vyvanse

Symptoms: Extreme fatigue, anhedonia, constant stressed/tense, mild to severe anxiety and lots of weird other symptoms. 
I listed all of them below at the end of the post.


Diagnoses by doctor:
ADHD(non hyperactive) 
General anxiety disorder
Atypical depression
Body dysmorphia bdd
Probably autism, but not that severe, doing the test now with my psychologist and she thinks so.


Clean addict, however, all symptoms except the visual disturbance were present before i started using in the first place. Some has got worse though. 
Also these symptoms are the reason i started self medicating.

What i have tried:
Tried almost every type of recreational drugs, most symptoms improve drastically on amphetamine and methylphenidate. Even the inflammation-like symptoms. 

50+ nootropics both common ones and obscure like semax and selank.
Tried all the standard antidepressant classes except MAOIs. And many neuroleptics in low doses to try to upregulate dopamine receptors.  No help except that anxiety might have improved on them.


I listed my symptoms below and i would really appreciate any ideas on both possible causes to test for and theories on why only the stims .
I really want to quit them and find a non-rewarding drug to help me without the triggering of my past drug use and to feel ok for more than 3 hours/day and at the cost of worsening symptoms in the afternoon.


Here are my symptoms:

 urination and difficulty emptying the bladder. Urgency to urinate. Leaking drops when sitting down or standing up. 

Constant fatigue; I can only perform non-cognitive tasks at best, and at worst, I struggle to brush my teeth, delay bathroom visits, and experience brain fog regardless of my current mental state. 

Pain in the neck and ankles, sometimes in the feet (underside), wrists, and fingers, especially when playing the guitar etc

Burning sensation under the foreskin when washing, requiring twice-daily washing to prevent inflammation and a foul smell. 

Burning and tingling sensation on the skin of the face in the morning, with swelling, especially in the eyelids. 

Urine smells bad and is occasionally foamy, but the foaming has improved. 

Overly tense and highly sensitive to stress and stimuli, to the point of avoiding phone calls entirely at times. 

Very stiff joints, unable to sit on heels, worst  in the upper back. 

Tingling in legs and forearms, like RLS accompanied by a heavy feeling, less intense now but constant. 

Trembling often when sitting or going down stairs. 

Symptoms almost disappear when running but return afterward, usually worsening then. 

Itchy rashes, eczema, dandruff, acne (less acne when other symptoms are better). 

Fluid has come out of the nipples a few times, accompanied by itching. 

Occasional chills, freezing especially in the morning, and sweats with an overheated feeling, usually in the evenings. Full feeling in the ears that decreases when turning the head, with a clicking sensation.

Many symptoms improve during fasting. Worse with adaptogens, I believe. 
 with stimulants, but worse in the evenings. Mild visual disturbances; things ""breathing,"" but unnoticed unless focused on. Temporary loss of sensation in feet and fingers, usually in parts of a finger, a 1-2 cm area. Extreme sweating, especially in the face, when warm. Heart palpitations even without anxiety, occurring intermittently.

I use nootropics to aid social functioning and when on them I have more to say, and my thinking is quicker and more efficient. Basically I'm more engaging to be around, and without them I feel dull, slow and awkward. Does anyone know why Latuda has hindered the magic of noots for me ?  Has anyone experienced this before ? I think it's stabilizing me so much it's not allowing any powerful, glowing mental shift to take place. I hate feeling dull on this medication.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Nootropics not working anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18chz1z/nootropics_not_working_anymore/
