I recently noticed that whenever I smoke a cigarette I instantly notice a massive nervous inner tension, brain fog which is paired with hyperarousal and enhanced distractibility for the duration of about half an hour after the cigarette.   At the moment I am trying to quit my tobacco intake but I am writing this post because I would like understand the pharmacology behind this phenomen.  I know nicotine has stimulating properties but I dont experience those symptoms when I take Vyvanse, Methlyphenidate or Modafinil. Interestingly, I dont experience these symptoms when I take a nicotine spray (so I might guess that it doesnt necessarily have to do with activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors??!!). What do you guys think could be the (pharmacological) reason?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why Does Smoking a Cigarette Instantly increase My Brainfog and Decrease My Excecutive Functioning?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/189x78u/why_does_smoking_a_cigarette_instantly_increase/

Right!

Any tried Milk Thistle?

This is week 3 of taking Milk Thistle, along with Rhodiola and Saffron extract and I feel significantly better

I've suffered from GAD and OCD most of my life. I have had a particularly nasty bout over last 6 months. Constantly renumerating distressing thoughts, therapy (CBT, ERP, ACT) wasn't helping at all. I came across this article, listing supplements that xan help with OCD: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7066598/ and I'd already tried most of them but I hadn't tried Milk Thistle and i read this: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20035818/ basically saying Milk Thistle is as effective as Prozac, without the side effects. So thought it was worth a try...... I took two pills in the AM and two in the PM along with Saffron and Rhodiola and by the next day, my thoughts were significantly better, and I'm feeling pretty good . Whilst Im far from cured and the thoughts are still there, they not as distressing, and I don't feel compelled to react to them or fight with them.

My biggest fear now is that the effectiveness is going to ware off. I'm going to try and have breaks and keep dosage down.

This also convinces me that my OCD isn't just psychological but there is also a brain chemistry factor that needs to be considered.

I'm wondering has anyone else had success with Milk Thistle, did it work for you and is it still working?",False,t5_4aoxhu,My possive experience with Milk Thistle and OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/188kwj7/my_possive_experience_with_milk_thistle_and_ocd/
