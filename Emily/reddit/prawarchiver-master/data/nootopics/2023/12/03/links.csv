I  got myself some 9-me-bc to combat my anhedonia, depression and fatigue... I only  later figured out that there is lots of controversy on whether it is  safe and what substances may be beneficial or problematic in combination  with it. I still want to give it a try since I've read many positive  reports on it, and since I am desperate enough to take some risks...

Based on what I have read, this is the stack I want to try for the next 20 days:

* 5mg 9-ME-BC sublingually, dissolved in 1ml PEG 400
* 500 mg Vit C liposomal as an antioxidant
* 40 mg Zinc-Gluconate as an antioxidant
* 800 mg NAC for liver protection
* 300 mg milk thistle seed powder for liver protection
* 650 mg Lion’s Mane extract for neuroprotection
* 100 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine for neuroprotection
* Omega 3: 500mg EPA, 250mg DPA, triglyceride form: for anti-inflammatory effects
* 50mg Curcumin for for anti-inflammatory effects
* 2000 IU Vitamin D3 for overall health
* 125 mg Niacin flush variant to reduce methyl groups
* 0,15 g psilocybin mushrooms 3x per week for antidepressive effects

What do you think about this stack? Do you see anything that might be problematic or that might be missing?

I've  also read that it is very caustic and burns your oral cavity, so I  wonder what can be done to reduce these negative side effects. I have just ordered  *PEG 400*  as a solvent for 9-ME-BC, since I have seen that some vendors sell it  as a liquid, solved in PEG400. My plan is to dissolve 5mg 9-ME-BC  dissolved in 1ml PEG400 and take it sublingually. Does that seem sound  to you?

Kind regards,

UPDATE 23.12.2023:  
I've been taking 5 mh 9-ME-BC every morning since about 2 weeks now, and I am pausing it over the christmas holidays. This is my experience so far:

&#x200B;

* It dissolves very well in PEG 400. I dissolved 15mg in 1 ml.
* In this mixing ratio it doesn't burn in my mouth, it still feels rather unpleasent and negatively effects my sense of taste. Especially coffe tastes awful even hours after taking it.
* It gives a feeling of alertness, that comes pretty quickly and lasts for a few hours. Heart rate  goes a bit up after taking it.
* It still didn't improve my cognitive performance, rather the opposite. I have more brain fog with 9-ME-BC than without.

I'm not sure  wheter I will continue taking it since I didn't experienceany positive effects from it.

What is your experience - should I be expecting positive effects after two weeks? Or did it take longer for you?
