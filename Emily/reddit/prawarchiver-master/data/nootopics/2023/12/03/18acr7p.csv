Collationem,"Neboglamine is a PAM of the glycine binding site of the NMDAR. SAGE-718 does look very promising as it is a direct PAM of the NMDAR (i.e. the PCP binding site).

I've already looked at custom synths for SAGE-718 but it's extremely expensive (even by custom synth standards).",1701688256,kbxuvo2,t3_18acr7p,t1_kbxtbgo,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
