CryptoEscape,"I was desperate too and I took the chance with 9-me-bc.  

I couldn’t even get out of bed and basic tasks felt downright painful.  

I’m incredibly glad I did.  I used much more than you (30 mg also Sublingual for 20 minutes every day.)

There’s no high or stimulant feeling IME, but I can get out of bed now, do basic tasks, not feel a chronic sense of doom, etc.  Basically I just feel like I should feel.

My life is good, there’s no environmental reason I should be anhedonic.

I dramatically cut back my excessive Kratom use too, almost effortlessly.  My previously low libido has come raging back…,I’m not sure if this is from cutting the Kratom or the MAOI properties.

The burning under your tongue is unpleasant, but I remind myself that a life of anhedonia is much worse.

I still have most my taste, some people do lose taste.  

I tried oral ROA last year, and I didn’t notice anything, but sublingual I do.

I’m on day 25 of a 40 day cycle.  I’m kinda scared to stop taking it, I really hope the improvement remains.",1701705962,kbyu0tw,t3_18ajzxp,t3_18ajzxp,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Yeah it is worse when I first place it. 

But I feel it mildly burn the whole 20 minutes.  And then for a few more minutes after swallowing.

What’s actually more annoying though is trying to not swallow all the saliva pooling up.

How long do you hold it for?

My technique of getting it under my tongue properly has improved a lot, which does make it easier",1701739011,kc1a46t,t3_18ajzxp,t1_kc198eu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"I only use it in one month cycle.  We don’t know if it’s safe, or even effective, to take longer.

But yeah every day, preferably in the morning, for 30 days.

I used 30 mg per day.  Some people use less (15-20 mg)

Yes I’d try to use it before you exam….it improved my memory and focus.

However your exam is far enough that you can do a cycle now, take a two month break, and then do another cycle.

Here’s the biggest trick to making 9-me-bc work:  You need to learn to hold it under your tongue for 15-20 minutes.  No swallowing.  This is surprisingly difficult at first and may take a few attempts to get right.  You don’t want saliva to pool up under your tongue….this dilutes it and makes it very difficult not to swallow.

So the best time to use it is upon waking up….youre a bit dehydrated and your mouth is dry….this makes it easier to hold it.  Also clamp your teeth and keep your mouth shut.  Don’t tilt your head forward (tilt it slightly back.)

I know that sounds like a pain, and it is, but if you do it right, 9-me-bc is one of the best nootropics out there.

Expect to notice an easier time getting motivated, better verbal fluency, high libido, and more.

Research potential side effects too, especially be careful in the sun.

fruiop,"Ah ok makes sense. The way you said it I thought that you were like in pain the whole time. I also do a max of 20 minutes. And yeah some burn after swallowing.

Snoo_93314,"My exam is on June 8, my grades are average, I am willing to study, but I cannot continue regularly and consistently. When I only study for a week, I cannot work for a week. If I exert myself, I get very sleepy, but when I play games, I never get sleepy...  


I want to work, I have to work and I love working, but even though I am so willing, studying makes me sleepy. No matter how well I sleep, I feel sleepy 1-2 hours after I start studying. My body is holding me back. Long time ago I set an alarm at 8 o'clock in the morning every day to solve math problems. I was able to comply with it for the first 2-3 days, but then I started to have a hard time staying up in the morning.  


I bought 300mg 9-mbc from Science Bio. How can I use this 300mg most effectively?  


If I were to take 30mg daily, I need 900mg of 9-MBC :(  


I think I will take 10mg daily. Would this be too little? I can do 2 cycles, I can take the last 15 days before my exam and I can take the other 15 days 2 months before my exam.  


9-How long does the effect of mbc last? 1 day? 2 days? 1 week?  


If you were me, how would you use 300mg 9-mbc?
