Let's say I take bromantane and phenylpiracetam in the morning and at lunchtime. Do I take NAC, tudca and milk thistle in the evening or before taking these nootropics? I've tried PPAP HCL and RGPU-95. These substances are clearly not nootropics but research chemicals. Since Friday I've been going crazy, I think it's destroyed my liver. Yet I was taking NAC, milk thistle, eating well, sleeping well and exercising. I'm going to stop everything and stick to bromantane and phenylpiracetam if my liver will let me. 
The pain below my ribs on my right side is worrying. Have a nice day!
