PabloAnnie,"Without doing any further research, I can share some info already stored in my long-term bio-memory circuit, about NAC specifically.

The way NAC protects cells, including in the liver, is because together with glycine it's all that is needed to synthesize glutathione, (one of the) main master anti-oxidants cells produce to protect themselves against ROS (reactive oxygen species). There is always a certain store of gluthatione so it's always available, as it's necessary every second you're alive, but especially when energy use is high.

ROS are by-products from using oxygen to burn glucose or other energy-supplying compounds to produce energy (in the form of ATP). The produced ATP powers basically every reaction happening in your cells. It's the gasoline for our bodies, directly powering any protein performing a reaction that needs energy (some don't, when just the temperature provides enough energy to start a reaction, they just speed-up(catalyze) particular reactions that would happen anyway(but too slow) as long as all molecules are present in a solution). Proteins can't directly use the energy stored in glucose etc, but need ATP (or some related molecules like creatine phosphate . This happens in every organ's cells; though particularly the organs that use the most energy, such as muscles, brain, liver etc, because they need to produce large wua6 ATP and thus are exposed to the most ROS.

ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) are extremely reactive molecules that will damage/destroy most things it happens to directly make contact with, such as cell-membrane components, DNA, proteins etc. Even worse, usually the damaged molecule now becomes just as reactive as the original ROS, creating a chain reaction that damages anything bouncing against the last damaged molecule. Too much exposure (high enough ROS concentrationz) could even kill a cell or severely damage it's DNA, resulting jn temporary or permanent mutations, even so much a cell will self-destruct which would e.g. prevent that cell from progressing to a tumour.

The only way this toxic pinball reaction can stop: when it comes into contact with (the right) anti-oxidant, gluthatione neutralizing large parts of total water-soluble ROS. To protect fatty components like membranes though, you'll need a fat-soluble anti-oxidant like (bioavailable) vitamin E (tocopherols), ALA(alpha lipoic acid, not the omega acid with the same initialism!) or others.

Lots of foods contain all kinds of really good anti-oxidants, like fruit (especially red/dark ones, who contain lots of anthocyanins, a very potent one) legumes, brown/red rice. Your body produces the bulk itself (AFAIK). Cells are able to store large amounts of gluthatione, while it doesn't have this capability for many other anti-oxi's. That's why it's so important to replenish and fill up those stores with e.g. NAC! Combine it with glycine though,1:1 as you need both to produce gluthatione. Also, cysteine is the only sulfur containing amino acid, which is crucial to produce proteins containing crosslinks (disulfide-bonds), so that's another plus.

Answering your question, gluthatione get's stored so I don't see the need to take it right before energy-demand increases. Rather do it before so your body has time to synthesize. Also make sure to take it on empty-stomach about â‰¥2-3h after last meal and ag least 30m before a meal. Else other proteins will compete with NAC for absorption and you'll take up less. 

It's also got numerous benefits for the brain, through other mechanisms. When taken before bed it helps your brain switch from primarily glutamatergic activity (excitating) to primarily GABAergic activity (inhibiting), so helping you fall asleep. During the day it can help against OCD-type symptoms, skin-picking, and many people with addictions have great benefit from it, helping them to feel better / reduce craving. This goes for numerous stimulants as well as downers, with research uncovering more by the day.

I do believe some say long-term (too high) administration could promote cancer somehow but I know nothing about that.

Also isn't Milk Thistle's active compound the anthocyanins I just mentioned? Believe people take that after exercise to promote recovery? So depends on your use-case as well.

If the pain is quite intense or keeps lingering, please call a doctor! Better safe than sorry :) 


Have a great day as well and keep learning!",1702497409,kd816gl,t3_18hmbag,t3_18hmbag,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
