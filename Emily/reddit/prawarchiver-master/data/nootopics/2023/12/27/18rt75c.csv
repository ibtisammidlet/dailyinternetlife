Upset_Scientist3994,"My bet would be anything increasing especially GDNF neurohormone what has the power to reset, harmonise, and increase general dopamine system thus working effectively against addictions. Cerebrolysin and Cortexin mentioned here have it directly. Many other things increase it more or less.

Here is lists; [https://mybiohack.com/blog/gdnf-what-it-is-and-how-to-increase-it](https://mybiohack.com/blog/gdnf-what-it-is-and-how-to-increase-it)

Peptide DNSP-11 mimics or increases release of GDNF and is tried for Parkinson disease for this reason. Or DNSP-6. But there is strangely very few user anecdotes out of them no matter how intresting they are at least for me. 

Because antipsychotics are the ones that block your dopamine, and shrink that system to death whereas stimulant drugs ruin it by burning receptors out - same result both ways.

And then along with it Fish oil, Uridine, Choline in order to give some substrate to rebuild new receptors.",1703780942,kfa7yeu,t3_18rt75c,t3_18rt75c,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"Dopamine antagonists? Perhaps berberine, because it is strutcurally related to dopamine and decreases inflamation + increases expression of dopamine receptors.

This effect is however blocked whenever a dopamine antagonist binds to the receptor. But perhaps it heals inbetween, it doesn't cause sognaling like dopamine agonists do",1703671404,kf3t2a4,t3_18rt75c,t3_18rt75c,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Do you have more exact data of berberine & dopamine receptor expression? I was into that thing since 2011, but recently have not taken due of some further studies on component and its pretty complex effect have mixed me. 

Just I would like to know how dopaminergic substance it actually is? This that not only increased dopamine via MAOI-impact, but receptor expression enhancement is something new. 

I also vaguely remember some science paper claiming that berberine increases dopamine.... by modulating microbial life in gut what is another issue then indeed.",1703696163,kf55cwy,t3_18rt75c,t1_kf3t2a4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

This should be helpful.
After reading your list of noots you’re trying as far as side effects or possible negative effects I’d consider it worth a shot or definitely some research atleast.",1703939392,kfjpzmw,t3_18rt75c,t1_kfjp1uy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
