Chisto23,"To be completely honest with you, and everyone should hear this right now, once you dive into medications such as what has been listed here by OP, not even saying one wouldn't need them, you're already too far in for anyone online to give you an accurate answer to a question like this with supplements to try, your brain is already modified with heavy drugs that alter your brain chemicals heavily, there is not one person here who can accurately tell you that you can benefit from something, you at this point you don't have a baseline brain at all, adding one ""promising"" supplement to the mix doesn't work for you the same way it does for others, theres so much alterations in brain chemicals right now that it's like shooting fish in a barrel, you're either going to have to hammer down and practice natural ways that don't involve intaking things, or you're going to have to guess for eternity finding just the right balance for your very own one of a kind brain makeup at this point.",1704385503,kgans2n,t3_18vhp7i,t3_18vhp7i,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

la_alchemista,"What‚Äôs worked for me during excruciating social anxiety is taking Milky Oats tincture as a preventative (so in the morning before emotions and mental disregulation start revving up) and in the moment of the anxiety symptoms. I truly don‚Äôt believe you can take this remedy too much. Tinctures are special in that you need 1-3 droppers and you hold them under your tongue or in your mouth for 20-30 seconds and the plant constituents go into your blood stream and into your brain and the effects work quickly after that. 
I would also suggest lowering caffeine and sugar intake, these things cause your adrenals fart and then they aren‚Äôt able to help you recover and burnout and brain fog happens. Being consistent with these things is important. I would also suggested taking lions mane and reishi mushrooms and adding ghee into your warm beverage this will help give your brain the food it needs to recover and heal. All of this together you will start giving your body and brain what it needs to start regrowing its neural pathways. And then you can probably start microdosing mushrooms again if that is something you want to implement again.

dushamp,"If Xanax was too drowsy, maybe a lower dose? I tried 0.25mg my first time and fell asleep a little later so a much lower dose may be the correct therapeutic dose for yourself. Otherwise, I‚Äôve had gabapentin be more of a way to turn off physiological symptoms that elevate anxiety like shaking or breathing heavily as a result of anxiety will then worsen itself after I notice it so it just makes me not hear my heartbeat in my ears during a situation or whatever. Benzos have been my holy grail after getting doses right, though something to understand with these medications is that they have downsides like physical dependence so it is recommended that during these states of less anxiety you do potentially try to unpack some of the stuff that makes you anxious, write it down, work through it in your head, figure out why specific things make you so uncomfortable and how they may not apply to new situations unlike old dynamics we experienced while younger or in a familial setting ya know?",1705487270,ki9ftcg,t3_18vhp7i,t3_18vhp7i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
