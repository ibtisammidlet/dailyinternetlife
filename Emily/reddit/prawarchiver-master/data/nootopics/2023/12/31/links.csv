I have many undermethylation symptoms and I'm trying to find a way to do genetic test here in Italy. That being said, bloodworks showed that I have high histamine and high homocysteine.

Recently I've started investigating this topic more and I have many doubts, in particular about the **relationship between undermethylation and slow COMT, since I also have overthinking/worrying issues, high perfectionism, and some obsessive thoughts (mostly health anxiety)**.

From what I've understood, usually an undermethylator has **low dopamine and serotonin**, thus he could boost methylation and the production of neurotransmitters by supplementing B vitamins and methyl donors, such as SAM-e, creatine and TMG.

However, if an undermethylator has also slow COMT, it usually means that **dopamine (and adrenaline) is high**.

What I don't understand is if:

> supplementing with SAM-e or other supps for increasing methylation would be suitable for people with slow COMT, or in this way dopamine would increase even more, thus exacerbating the anxiety symptoms?
