sirsadalot,"Absolutely. Just so you know I can 100% assure you that getting real Phenylpiracetam, that isn't the hydrazide version, is like fucking impossible in China. That's why I'm even skeptical when vendors say they have it at all in the US.",1703232439,kefv7l6,t3_18o848p,t3_18o848p,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

tapestry0fm0lecules,I don’t wanna promote as I’m skeptical as they had black shards in their product but umbrella labs sent me the hydrazide verson that was contaminated so resent me normal phenyl and yea it was 100% real I have used this for a long time and it was def real but that was months ago,1703277971,keifdq0,t3_18o848p,t1_kefv7l6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
dootiedog,Wait were you saying that the phenylpiracetam sold at these low prices might actually just be phenylpiracetam hydrazide? Or would that also be completely bunk at that pricepoint?,1703303715,kek3ho9,t3_18o848p,t1_kefv7l6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Probably still the hydrazide version. Unless you're saying you got it 3rd party tested to prove otherwise. It has been off the market for a few years now,1703289626,kej8ge0,t3_18o848p,t1_keifdq0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Oopsimapanda,"Same exact thing happened to me and I speculated they sent me the hydrazide on purpose in an attempt to dump it, hoping the customer doesn't notice. I put that in a review and they deleted it. 

That being said, they sent me the real thing after too and I compared both and it def seems legit.",1703333742,kelj2d5,t3_18o848p,t1_keifdq0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,You’re sure it was contaminated or irregular? Because their bro was different and legit. They have coas I don’t expect them to be dishonest,1703839890,kfe33wc,t3_18o848p,t1_keifdq0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,I don't know either way its a no from me,1703318478,kekt9lo,t3_18o848p,t1_kek3ho9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Oopsimapanda,"They have third party verification attached on all their stuff, so unless you think their third party is fraudulent ([MZ biolabs](https://cdn-hecpl.nitrocdn.com/JKJNweyaRldoRBjbiBHLeWGwiYmwuSUu/assets/images/optimized/rev-7079f04/umbrellalabs.is/wp-content/uploads/08-08-2023-umbrella-labs-phenylpiracetam-certificate-of-authenticity-coa-768x991.jpg)) then seems like it's the real deal. 

I've tried both their Hydrazide and reg PP. Hydra is complete bunk, normal PP feels 100% legit.",1703334435,kelkdyd,t3_18o848p,t1_kej8ge0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,If you have means to test it I’ll send you the left over jar I have with has allot of extra powder on it if you have the means to test it. Send to ec or whatever but I wonder if it’s something different in disguise because it tasted and felt the same as old phenyl,1703537683,kewk8l4,t3_18o848p,t1_kej8ge0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,"Yes, it was small black chunks in the white powder I still probably have a pic.",1703875207,kfg313q,t3_18o848p,t1_kfe33wc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tapestry0fm0lecules,Food for thought thank you,1703375261,keobyic,t3_18o848p,t1_kekt9lo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,I believe you that’s unfortunate. I’ve always gotten quality products from them it’s sad they’d send that out and put that on their reputation.,1703933911,kfjiek2,t3_18o848p,t1_kfg313q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
