_SaintJimmy_,">Dopamine agonism helped my anhedonia

Dopamine agonists are typically used to treat hyperprolactinoma. If they help, it could be an indication of very high prolactin levels. Have you had your prolactin levels checked recently?",1702118105,kcm9e4m,t3_18bgkxx,t3_18bgkxx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
LlamaMan777,"A couple of things make me wonder if it is diet related. You mentioned that many crashes are food related. Additionally, and I really mean this respectfully, 125lbs is pretty light for a guy your age. Can totally be healthy, if you are smaller in stature/frame etc, but isn't the norm. What is your diet like? Are you underweight, or do you follow any non-conventional eating patterns? Dietary deficiencies can and do cause psychological problems, and psychiatrists are notorious for not looking into diet. I knew one girl who tried multiple doctors and a laundry list of meds for her depression and other issues until one doc finally figured out she had a serious B vitamin deficiency due to undereating on a vegan diet. Fixed the B vitamin problem and went off of all meds.",1702185633,kcqemsf,t3_18bgkxx,t3_18bgkxx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Yeah I'm very underweight. Genetics + being on stimulants for basically all of my life for ADHD fucked my appetite. 

My diets pretty good actually. I got on the self improvement wave last year and started eating healthy. I throw in the occasional McDonalds every once in a while but overall it's good. 

Interesting about the girl. Lol, I hope my case is that simple that I just need to take some sort of vitamin to get better. I doubt it though tbh. I believe I have some sort of inflammation in my CNS from the abrupt withdrawal. (also my b12 is normal)",1702352890,kczrolq,t3_18bgkxx,t1_kcqemsf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,The normal range is between 211 and 911. Mine sits at 620. Initially mine was pretty high when this first began though. 847 when I got my symptoms 2 weeks after stopping the supplements.,1702932816,kdxxzam,t3_18bgkxx,t1_kdvkfv2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
