As I‘m very interested in trying these out (reason why I bought them) and don‘t want to waste any of these I paid for, I was wondering which (pharmacologically speaking) are okay to take with Wellbutrin - and won‘t have any dangerous interactions or cause other risks.

I also know (and plan to do so) that I should first wait on Wellbutrin‘s full effect and only then start supplements so I can clearly see if and hos much Wellbutrin is helping me and to know what effect comes from what, the Wellbutrin or the supplement.

1. Any of these NOT safe to take in combination with Wellbutrin which is a NDRI?

2. Any of these that actually might combine and work quite well like pharmacologically synergistically with Wellbutrin?

Talking of:

Ashwagandha

Beta Alanin

Creatine

Omega 3 Fish Oil

GABA

Inositol

L-Phenylalanine

L-Tyrosine

L-Citrulline

L-Arginine

L-Glutamine

Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)

Black Seed Oil (probably interacting not too safely? because of the strong action on this typical enzyme - how was it called P450 or CYPsomething - you know better)

Bacopa

Gotu Kola

Ginseng

Gingko

Skullcap

Kanna

My case seems to be complex and I'm looking for some advice for how to proceed, as I'm losing faith in my doctors to be able to address my issues.

21M 125lb

Previous issues: ADHD & GAD

Lions Mane (RealMushrooms - 30% beta glucans) - 1g (4 months daily)

Zinc (Nature Made) - 30mg (6 months daily)

Men’s One a day gummies (6 months daily)

Fish oil (Nature Made)- 1400mg (3 months daily)

Ashwaganda KSM-66 (Goli) - 300mg (5 months daily)

Vitamin D3 - 7500UI (6 months daily)

Creatine 2-3x per week 2.5G (8 months on / off)

**Symptoms**

No issues other than insomnia on the supplements which Began only after consistent Lion's mane use. Upon withdrawal I developed the following symptoms gradually over the course of 13 days.

anhedonia / emotional blunting, 24/7 rapid fire paresthesia, insomnia, episodic strong anxiety flareups, brain fog, tremors in my legs and fingers, no appetite, strange trains of mental visual imagery, dry mouth, entering dissociative states in the middle of the night, low libido, can’t feel endorphins / get runners high, waking up with numb body parts, and weird head sensations, episodic depression episodes (nothing matters, everything is pointless type of thoughts and feelings)

A lot of those subsided around 2-3 months into withdrawal; However the side effects in the title remain. Paresthesia has calmed down and the anhedonia / blunting is not as intense as it was in the beginning. However it is still very debilitating and drastically effecting my quality of life. I also still have the typical disinterests that come with anhedonia such as low libido and low motivation to do my hobbies.

**Anhedonia & Crashes**

Anhedonia / emotional blunting has been the one thing preventing me from truly enjoying my life since this began. At first it was so bad that it felt like I was with drawling from a hard drug. It was fucking insane and felt like I was being starved for dopamine. My parents have a video of me just groaning in mental agony walking around the house. It's improved since then and now it fluctuates and never stays at the same level for more than 1-2 weeks. What keeps happening is that it slowly and gradually improves in waves over weeks and sometimes month(s). It even gets to points where I almost enter remission sometimes. However randomly while or directly after eating food I will crash and lose all of the progress I just made. The crash happens as follows, I feel depressed and start feeling as though nothing in life matters and everything is pointless. (Irrational unnatural depressive thoughts and feelings). I then continue to get very depressed for about 20 minutes. While this is happening I slowly and gradually lose my ability to feel emotions over the span of 30 minutes. It then gets to a point where it feels as though my conscious awareness is decreased and I get terrible brain fog. I then keep getting worse for about 1-4 days. Until the process repeats itself. This process has repeated itself 7 times now.

As mentioned, all of my crashes have happened from food. It's been many different types of foods. Chicken broc rice bowl, yogurt, cheeseburger, buffalo chicken pizza, steak & cheese sandwich. I can eat these things and be fine, and then randomly while eating them I crash and I lose all of my progress that I had just made with the anhedonia for the past month or so. I still eat these foods since this reaction does not happen every time. The crashes set me back so far from where I had just improved with my progress. Its soul crushing and the experience itself is agonizing as it feels as though my body is draining itself of neurotransmitters and I slowly lose my ability to connect with life.

**Treatments**

I've seen 3 doctors including a neurologist, GP, and psychiatrist and none of them have been very helpful for getting to the bottom of this so far. My GP perscribed me some medication which helped me get through the initial anhedonia. Medication wise I have been placed on 4 meds already from doctors. I have an unnatural response to them now. The first time I took Sertraline I had a 75% improvement in anhedonia just an hour after taking the first pill. Day 2, I was in full remission for more than 2 weeks. 2 months later I tried duloxetine and upon taking the first pill I was in remission for 8 days just 45 minutes after taking the pill. Emotions and pleasure returned completely and gradually over the course of 45 more minutes after I noticed the pills effects. Both meds did not have the same effect again however. Duloxetine though would always help me get back to my baseline faster whenever I crashed. Upon taking each pill would usually follow an tiny improvement in my anhedonia. This eventually stopped the more I took the medication however. I have since stopped duloxetine.

I've also had success with low dose Abilify. I can't get back on it however since it gives me akathisia for about 4 weeks. Stops when I stop the drug or when the drug starts to take it's actual AP effect. I'd like to note that I believe it's the partial dopamine agonism that helps my anhedonia when I take it. Since it helped so early on.

The last med I took I had an extreme negative reaction to. I had added Wellbutrin to my 30mg of duloxetine. an hour after taking it I felt off and dissociated. 6 hours later I had life ruining level emotional blunting that lasted a week before randomly lifting. After it lifted I went 2 months with small gradual improvements and was almost back at baseline. Then randomly after eating a fucking buffalo chicken pizza I crashed so hard to the point I was bedridden for a weekend and my parents had to help me walk around my house because I felt so weak. It felt like I had little to no neurotransmitters being produced in my body. My skin was barley sensitive and I couldn't even produce a deep voice. I sounded weak and frail. I haven't taken any anti depressants since this happened back in the beginning of October.

**Recent Testing.**

I've done various bloodwork at the hospital when I stayed there for a week at the beginning of my issues and with my GP. I've just finished another round of bloodwork with tests she wanted to run. Here are the results.

MRI: normal

TSH: 1.07

T3 free: 3.2

T4 free 1.59

cortisol: 14.6

DHEA-S: 542

Vit D: 25

Came back negative for heavy metals as well.

hmu with some ideas for things to test for as my psychiatrist wants to continue down the hormonal route for bloodwork.

**Conclusions & Questions:**

I believe my issue is simply a disruption in serotonin and dopamine. Considering how drastically the SSRI and SNRI effected me I believe this is my issue. However this is just the end result of a complex process that has been disrupted. What mechanisms are responsible for this that I need to repair, is a question I don't have an answer for. Which is why I've come to the internet for help. The answer seems to lie within my gut, so any info surrounding healing my gut would be appreciated.

What do you think happened to me? Why did this happen only upon cessation? What's up with random meals being the impetus for the crashes?

Should I try some sort of anti-inflammatory drug? It seems I have inflammation in my gut from the abrupt cessation. I think my body got used to the mass production of serotonin from lions mane and ashwagandha that it couldn't compensate for the abrupt cessation and sent my body into chaos.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Dysfunctional reward system, offset by abrupt supplement withdrawal. 6 months of episodic low mood, chronic anhedonia / emotional blunting, paresthesia, and strange head sensations",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/18bgkxx/dysfunctional_reward_system_offset_by_abrupt/
