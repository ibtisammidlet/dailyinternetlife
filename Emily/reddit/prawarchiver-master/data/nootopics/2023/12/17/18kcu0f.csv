Legitimate_Banana512,"First, look into its specifics. Gather everything reaearch found on this subject for dihexa.

Than, look into what you are asking now. Yes, you can take things to prevent and/or minimize cancer growth. Yoh can do these things that work against a broad range or a feew different specific cancers. But it will always be a risk",1702889237,kdvbdhz,t3_18kcu0f,t3_18kcu0f,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"I tbh wouldn’t be too concerned it’s not carcinogenic as far as I know.

How is the experience?",1703840186,kfe3hsz,t3_18kcu0f,t3_18kcu0f,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neetiemad,There aren't many other good avenues for reversing brain damage breh,1702934787,kdy3j3p,t3_18kcu0f,t1_kdv42vs,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,Actually increased risk of cancer in case you already have a tumor in you applies with all neurogenic substances. But they are only way to go if to reverse a brain damage.,1702936183,kdy7f30,t3_18kcu0f,t1_kdy3j3p,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
neetiemad,So should I fast before doing any of this? Megadose Quercetin?,1702936971,kdy9kh9,t3_18kcu0f,t1_kdy7f30,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"I guess that matters if you have cancer then its growth may increase similarly like your brain cells on dihexa. If you dont have then should be no issue. 

And it is not that simple, say nerve-growth-factor (NGF) also spreads tumors, yet lions mane mushroom what increases NGF seem to work against cancer due of some other useful components in it, and then that correlation with increased neurogenesis and cancer is not mayby that simple. Notice that neurogenetic stuff does not cause cancer as such, but similarly as they help your brain cells to branch and connect they can also work in direction of making cancer metastasize better.",1702946796,kdyyaq2,t3_18kcu0f,t1_kdy9kh9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"But of course there are so numerous supplements what appear generally healthy and seem to work against cancer so there is always option to consume those what have some good health effects anyway. Like milk thistle what is basically non-toxic and tolerated, but as a bonus increases TrkB expression for more neurogenesis...",1702946883,kdyyi55,t3_18kcu0f,t1_kdyyaq2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
