Are you saying that when the stimulants wear off you're tempted to escalate dosage and/or use non-therapeutic ROAs? Or are you referring more to the dependence that regular use causes?

Even without dependence as an issue, I'm struggling to see how taking a nootropic or non-stimulant medication every day is really any different. You still have to take them regularly to achieve an effect.

Other options would include CBT from a licensed psychologist. I'm not familiar with its effectiveness for ADHD, however.

The thing is stimulants donâ€™t just work while they are in your system. They normalize brain function long term because they enable behavioral changes feeding back facilitating brain changes.

Alpha receptor antagonists can be used to treat ADHDâ€”clonidine and guanfacine. Guanfacine longer half life so is preferred but both are used in clinical practice. I used clonidine but plan to switch to guanfacine. If you are appreciably agitated as part of ur ADHD then things like lithium or add on antipsychotic can be used typical at night. Some of the newer antipsychotics are not broad spectrum dopamine receptor blockers and actually increase dopamine in conjunction with psychostimulants. Those ones gave me mad akathesia so I just stick with gold old seroquel for smoother sleep.

With vyvanse my motivation to do what I had to do was at 1000%. I only stopped to eat or to go to the toilet. I would literally run to the computer to start or continue work. The problem is that when I sat down at the computer and looked at the screen I couldn't think. I had a lot of difficulty reading a text and forming an idea about it. It was like the more I tried to think, the less focus I had. Therefore, despite my motivation being maximum, my productivity was terrible. And today I still suffer a lot from this condition.

EchoingSimplicity,"The example you gave is tinkering with receptor types, which is beside the argument I was making. And, for your last sentence, I did not say there couldn't be improvements. Admittedly, I wasn't very clear, so let me explain:

Dopaminergic stimulants (amphetamine, methylphenidate + analogs) don't seem to majorly improve executive dysfunction. I have ADHD and have taken stimulants for over a decade. My time management, prioritization, task initiation, and organizational skills don't improve on stimulants. What *does* improve is focus and productivity.

Stimulants simply allow me to get more work done, but not necessarily the right kind of work. They improve some aspects of executive function, but don't touch the meat of the issue. Same with non-stimulants. Over time (especially combined with therapy) this can change, but acutely it doesn't.

Why? Because there is literally infrastructure that a neurotypical has which an ADHD individual doesn't. This isn't just some abstract concept. A neurotypical when working has an intuitive sense for their executive function. Some part of their mind can *feel* how much time has passed and can *feel,* in comparison, how much time they should be spending.

They can *feel* in the back of their mind when what they're focusing on isn't important. They even have a whole map of how their day needs to go, constantly sitting there in the periphery of their awareness, keeping them on track. And they compare their progress to their plan, intuitively improving and changing it, all without having to think about it consciously (though they can if they need to).

There is *literally* a whole aspect of experience, of subconscious and intuitive processing that ADHD individuals don't have access to. And *stimulants don't give you access to it*. They just make focusing and being productive easier. Maybe you'll, over time, pick up on skills that you would've learned if born neurotypical, or maybe you need therapy to figure it out.

SunDevil329,"Decision was made a long time ago. For me it's gotta be fuck yes. I'll do what I can with nootropics / supplements, but they've always been somewhat (or very) underwhelming. Additionally, there are noots that reduce neurotoxicity from Rx stims, such as ALCAR, magnesium, and Na-R-ALA. 

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I find properly keeping up with any kind of journaling/tracking is impossible. It requires a significant time, effort, and energy investment for some of us, depending on our issues and obligations. 

Glad it worked for you, but personally I'd rather take a medication prescribed by my doctor for conditions covered by the DSM-5.",1683420542,jj5l0a9,t3_13a1uv2,t1_jj5ft8v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SurfaceThought,"In the prefrontal cortex, which doesn't have dopamine transporters and relies on NET for dopamine transport. Methylphenidate binds about three times more strongly to DAT than NET, those two facts combined are precisely why atomoxetine would raise dopamine more in the prefrontal cortex.

Anyway, I wasn't even comparing to atomoxetine, it wouldn't even matter if atomoxetine raised dopamine for than methylphenidate -- it could still be the case and indeed is that Methylphenidate works more strongly on the dopaminergic system that the noradrenaline",1686449810,jnqdkwk,t3_13a1uv2,t1_jnps46m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

 I believe that at therapeutic dosing both methylphenidate and amphetamine disproportionally affects prefrontal catecholamines. As dose increases it starts affecting other regions. This should inherently bias them towards increasing adrenergic neurotransmission at low therapeutic dosing.

I found a few using microdialysis to analyze monoamine concentration in various brain regions after administering MPH. However, they all used doses greater than 1mg/kg. That would have most adults(averaging 60kg-80kg) taking 70mg or more, which seems rather high IMO. These studies all do show a significant increase in striatal dopamine.",1686460786,jnqw4pl,t3_13a1uv2,t1_jnqdkwk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
