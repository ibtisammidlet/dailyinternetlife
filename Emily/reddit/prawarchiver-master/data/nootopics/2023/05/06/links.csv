But I would like to know your opinion and experience. Stimulants fix me, BUT, they also make me depressed when it wears off and cause addiction. I don't like the idea of ​​having to take something EVERY TIME I need to be helpful/sociable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against medication, my problem is drugs that you need to take all the time to feel good when you take them. I am a fan of medications that you can take daily and that have a cumulative effect, like Wellbutrin for example. I already took it, but it didn't help me with the adhd issue.

I know there is healthy eating, less sugar, organization (all the things Andrew Hurbman talks about), but I live a very healthy life and I've done everything to try to get better, but it seems that my brain has a problem. Extremely anxious and forgetful, clear social anxiety from the adhd (stimulants cure it).

So I don't know how far I'll be able to get away from the meds. Is there a way to cure it with drugs other than conventional stimulants? I've tried several nootropics with no effect.

Honestly, I'm even thinking about trying a MAOI because of its dopaminergic properties, many people say it can be stimulating without being addictive.
