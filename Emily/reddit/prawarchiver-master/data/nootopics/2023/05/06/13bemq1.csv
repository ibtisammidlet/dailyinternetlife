analXplorer,"I tried this with propylene, which in of itself made the spray quite unpleasant. The effects where waaaay stronger than both oral or sublingual pregnenolone. 

I think the formulation is the hard part, and you’d also need the right form of pregnenolone, but I’m certain there’s nootropic potential here. 

It’s very likely using pregnenolone as a spray might greatly reduce the side-effects of long term oral or sub usage.",1683534229,jjb9o25,t3_13bemq1,t3_13bemq1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"Interesting. One of my nostrils has been chronically stuffed for a while. This makes me wonder whether, if I was to be taking bromantane nasal spray, for example, I'd be able to get the effects to my whole brain. It seems as though IN would be limited in effectiveness if you can't properly dose through both nostrils perhaps?",1683548912,jjbtmpu,t3_13bemq1,t3_13bemq1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

harry_lawson,">In contrast to frontal cortex and hippocampus, the treatment with vehicle produced an effect in the amygdala, similar (although smaller) in size to the effect of the low dose (vehicle T10: +11%, vehi-cle T30: +15%, low dose T30: +14%, low dose T60: +29%). The time curve after treatment with the high dose showed a relative rise of ACh between +111% (T100) and +206% (T50)

The vehicle they were using produced a statistically significant effect in the Amygdala, comparable to the low dose pregnenolone group.

I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty sure the vehicle is supposed to be an inactive carrier.

All these rat studies on neurosteroids as potential treatments are a bit iffy to me.

DidNotVote2020,"Intranasal needs a nano emulsion gel for ideal absorption, similar to what is used for intranasal test. From a quick glance at the study, it looks like they used a nasal gel of some sorts that likely served a similar function. This also makes a big difference with improving the consistency of intranasal application.",1683566615,jjcz7i1,t3_13bemq1,t1_jjb95vj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
