If not, would Fladrafanil be distinct enough to not be considered an analog to modafanil, given it is a pro-drug? I understand the law only applies to Schedule 1 and 2, but I believe \*the purchase\* of analogs of any scheduled substance (unclear where the line is drawn here) remains illegal.

Here's maybe a better question that provides a frame of reference for the answer I'm seeking: would the purchase of either/both flmodafinil/fladrafinil be any more questionably legal than the purchase of say, Bromantane (unscheduled and not an analog of any scheduled substance, but also still considered a drug)?

Thank you in advance to those of you who take the time to answer!

p.s.

Before someone tells me not to worry about this as no law-enforcing agency will proactively monitor and regulate the purchase of (what may or may not be) a schedule 4 analog (Modafinil) - I know this. That isn't my issue. I am genuinely curious of the answer to the primary question.
