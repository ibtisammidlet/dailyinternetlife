sirsadalot,"I leave them up honestly because it builds SEO for the subreddit, even if only I and a few others ever bother to publish something in depth

The fast track to learning pharmacology was an attempt at inspiring people to make more educated statements and questions, but it's 2023 and peoples attention span is just awful

I'd love to have other high value posters, but those types of people want the larger reach of other subreddits and platforms, even if in the case of r/Nootropics they might get perma banned over trivial reasons down the road

It will only really kick into high gear when I or someone else shifts focus towards growing the subreddit, but for some reason or another something goes wrong everywhere else so I'm left constantly attending to the barrage of attacks 

I have asked others if they were interested in taking a moderator position, but when I broke the news that it entails actual work like promoting NooTopics, they stopped caring

It likely won't expand much more than it has been until I get a grip on life and build the NooTopics app which will crosslink with reddit and possibly discord simultaneously. I don't really trust the admins to have my good intentions at heart, with them suspending my account on one occasion for simply selling Bromantane. I need to actually own the community, yaknow, otherwise it's at risk of collapse

Nevertheless I haven't given up on the idea of the NooTopics app. It will come... eventually",1684646017,jkztee9,t3_13n83gh,t3_13n83gh,1,True,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Unfortunately, I doubt it would make a huge difference, as I suspect many gloss over that.

That said, there are several posts by /u/sirsadalot that I wouldn't mind seeing pinned. The fast track to pharmacology is a start, but perhaps some of these (in order of importance to those new to this sub):

mikorbu,"Seconding this!

Also despite the annoyance and repetition of similar questions being asked, they can also catch different people/time-zones that missed the originals and can add plenty of new perspectives, experiences, and questions to the discussion.

And with a majority of us dealing with RCâ€™s and fringe nootropics, any experience and course-correction against side-effects is worth many times over the slight iffiness of a repost :)",1684621531,jkyiav0,t3_13n83gh,t1_jkyfdsv,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"Yeah the only downside of Reddit is that information about a certain topic can be kind of smeared out over numerous tiny pieces, while in the 'ol days on a forum you'd just continue in the same thread. Sometimes you search for sth and you get 30 threads and they all contain 1 or two replies. Can take a while to sift through.

I wouldn't know any solution to that directly, except it might be an idea to work together on a kind of Nootopics wiki where we can accumulate the most important info. If new threads with new revelations then come we could condense it into the wiki so it won't disappear in a pile of noise. It can start real simple by just listing noots and their pharmacokinetic parameters, dosage, ROA's, most common effects / reports etc.",1685027615,jlko301,t3_13n83gh,t1_jkyiav0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
