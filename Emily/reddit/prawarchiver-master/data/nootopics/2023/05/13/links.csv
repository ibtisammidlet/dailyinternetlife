Bromantane is supposed to increase the expression of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, but I have read that this increase in the enzyme occurs at 1.5 - 2 hours, so I wonder if it is better to take bromantane first and then tyrosine or the other way around, let the tyrosine be absorbed and maybe it's in the neurons?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Bromantane and Tyrosine, which should be consumed first?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/13jncl0/bromantane_and_tyrosine_which_should_be_consumed/

 Phosphatidylserine works by reducing any cortisol rise from the pregnenolone which is the big issue for me. last night I decided to bike for 2 hours because I felt like it starting at 12:28 am. 

I was dropping off some mail I wanted to send last night because the mail lady I don't think likes me, so I usually now find those blue collection boxes and bike there, like a 9 minutesl round trip. 

after doing that I decided to bike across the bridge in my area as it's been a while, ok like an extra 10 minutes, then I wanted to go a little bit further.. but then I'd figured I could to all the way to the very top of the beach side part of my area, and I did, and even slightly further. in total the actual trip takes 2 hours there and it was really enjoyable for me. 

I don't think I would have ever done this without pregnenlone. like yeah I am 19, but I'm not an athlete, and that's really impressive for me. 
for comparison, DHEA somehow rises testosterone or maybe DHT wayy to high and makes me feel stressed and angry, which I think DHEA and cortisol are correlated. has anyone else tried this? 

also, I take finasteride twice a week, it prevents hair loss for me I think and more importantly acne which pregnenolone I know will cause (DHT doesn't like my skin or rather the other way around).",False,t5_4aoxhu,pregnenolone+ Phosphatidylserine=lots of energy ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/13gsnpd/pregnenolone_phosphatidylserinelots_of_energy/
