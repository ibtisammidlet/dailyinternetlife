slvneutrino,"Bromantane has quite a long half life. If you take it daily, you're going to reach a steady state in blood concentration over time. 

So at some point, the time of tyrosine ingestion won't matter. 

If you are going to supplement tyrosine, just make sure you're taking both, to make sure your tyrosine levels remain adequate at all times, and the bromantane will do it's thing.",1684612942,jkxzctq,t3_13jncl0,t3_13jncl0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Adding more tyrosine will make no difference and in some studies increases oxidative stress and decreases dopamine with high intake.

The reason bromantane is stimulatory partially because it enhances TH. If this is the case then it's proof there was already tyrosine. And that's logical because tyrosine deficiency is rare.

Tyrosine will just go towards protein and other endogenous chemicals if you supplement it",1684330200,jkhx27h,t3_13jncl0,t3_13jncl0,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

DJ-P-,"sirsad has said tyrosine supplementation is unnecessary as it is rare to be deficient. some people have said it works better with tyro otherwise bromo is useless. 

I would take tyro first than 20-30 mins later bro. it probably needs an hour to be absorbed but again stuff you can test. 

actually just take it at the same time, I personally wouldn't care enough to do something like this",1684292699,jkgczax,t3_13jncl0,t3_13jncl0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
DMT-Rockets,What if you have ADHD and do not already produce enough dopamine? To a smooth brain like me logically it tells me to supplement tyrosine if I‚Äôm going to be increasing tyrosine hydroxylase,1684316923,jkhakgm,t3_13jncl0,t3_13jncl0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bierak,"I have felt the benefits tyrosine by taking it with EGCG, since it inhibits dopa decarboxylase enzyme in the PNS.
