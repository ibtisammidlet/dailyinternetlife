I know that any supplement I take like DHEA or shilijat that directly acts on testosterone makes me irritated so I don't think I'm a candidate for steroids. 

I just think it's great you can correct hormone issues maybe due to your past environment or genetics. we weren't made to be perfect",1684041279,jk32pkr,t3_13gsnpd,t1_jk2vkyb,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"DHEA negatively modulates GABA activity and inhibits serotonergic activity in downstream cascades.   

Testosterone, and downstream metabolites, DHT and estradiol increase GABA activity.

DHEA also decreases cortisol, and I get the best results when I take DHAE and prognenolone in the morning, thus both of these hormones peak early in the l circadian cycle.",1684069950,jk43fon,t3_13gsnpd,t1_jk32pkr,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Very science-based approach I see.

No oral DHT blockers are worth it for young men. Your masculinity (especially during development) matters a lot more than some acne.

It's your choice.",1684073453,jk4a75k,t3_13gsnpd,t1_jk42rks,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Buddy DHEA can also cause oily skin, and some other secondary male sexual characteristics, as it can also activate androgen receptors.  

If fact, boys who get acne and body hair growth at age of 9-10 do so through increased adrenal activity and DHEA production, while their testicular testosterone production has not kicked-in yet.

It is also possible that what you are experiencing with pregnenolone + PS can be easily explained by DHEA as well.

You take pregnenolone before sleep, which converts to DHEA, which lowers GABA activity, which messes with your sleep and make you feel energised, and you take PS which increases GABA.

Hypothesizing at this point is moot without testing anything. If you are too worried you get saliva tests for hormones including cortisol and see the numbers and then act according to data.",1684079402,jk4n0xf,t3_13gsnpd,t1_jk42rks,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

DJ-P-,"I think you completely missed the point about how pregnenolone will raise DHT. 

because I already have things that raise testosterone individually, and I know what a lot of testosterone feels like. and I know that taking finasteride at high doses without pregnenolone like I did before was something I didn't like. 

this is really the only way I can correct my hormones so I can be a better person. you also still didn't address the safety profile from finasteride bc you'd don't ain't got shit on it. 

if you want to talk about the neurosteroid risk if there is any because all that's from is from like a way higher multiple dose on rats, and I take etifoxine generally anyway. 

I would understand if I was like 16 and I was taking it but after puberty, It really does not matter. if you care so much about young men and finasteride I would watch hair Cafe's video on it. [actually here you go](https://youtu.be/6zdK_YdE1nM)

like come on do you think I didn't read a bunch about this and try it myself before figured out this regimen. no point in talking to people like you. do you even know how much 100mg of pregnenolone is and how obvious in my situation that a log of it is turning into DHEA which feeds testosterone than DHT? 

I really don't get it when I've taken finasteride and my acne goes away but it lowers DHT too much, but then when I take it with pregnenolone it's the perfect balance of having healthy DHT and test while still having happy skin. also my skin genetics are horrible and I abhore my parents for not even doing anything about it when I was in middle school, I really don't care what you think. do you think men who go bald or actually confident or are they just coping?? it's literally a lie that you're attractive bald, and the same applies to skin. 

also, puberty ends at 16??? like what lol. ""my development"" I wish I could make your face look like shit and make you start losing hair so I could see the choice you'd make in my situation. but keep on regurgitating the bs because you're locked in for life and people like you don't deserve to even be spoken to. because ur stuuupidddd and don't bother to read what I say for the past responses and that's why I typed all of this up. 

have fun NOT responding to anything I say. oh wait, maybe this response was because of my heightened test and DHT from pregnenolone, any more DHT without finasteride and I'd probably be moving mountains to ensure your opinion could never ever ever be heard again.
