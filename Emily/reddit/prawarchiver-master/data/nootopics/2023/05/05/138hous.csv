sirsadalot,"So, I can't edit this post because it's now saying it's breaking the character count, so I'll just post it here:

1. I mistakenly called Trk a g-coupled protein receptor, but obviously it's an enzyme-linked receptor/ tyrosine kinase receptor.
2. I said Kd is when 50% of targets are ""inhibited"", but I meant occupied.

I made some other typos, but they're not as bad as these two. I also forgot to add a guide for animal dose to human dose conversion, so I'll put it in this comment.

Rat to human is mg/kg x (7/37) x human kg (60kg standard).

Mouse to human is mg/kg x (3/37) x human kg.

For other animal species, revert to this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804402/)",1683391943,jj3v4xw,t3_138hous,t3_138hous,1,True,t5_4aoxhu

IncreasinglyTrippy,"Over time I have noticed and noted that various compounds that are all classified together like ‚Äúincrease dopamine‚Äù have still very different ‚Äúdopaminergic‚Äù effects but could never understand why. 

In this example, caffeine, other than causing wakefulness (I‚Äôm assuming through blocking adenosine) seems to distinctly increase the feeling of optimism. But modafinil, while also affecting wakefulness (but not through adenosine?) seem to affect motivation much more but not optimism. Adderall, affects focus more than motivation or optimism. 

I am wondering if the type of analysis you describe here can be used to explain the differences.",1683484585,jj8ng3o,t3_138hous,t3_138hous,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
