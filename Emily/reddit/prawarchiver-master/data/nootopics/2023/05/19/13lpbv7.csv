Unique-Application33, I've used N-Acetyl-Selank from science(dot)bio in conjunction with naSemax and found to to dramatically reduce and pretty much eliminate social anxiety.

jdt8983,I do.  It's a game changer for me.  Im still doing trial and error with other peptides too (ipamorelin can apparently help with mood) but selank has cured my lifelong debilitating anxiety.  Everychem.com for Selank.  I'm not promoting the company for everything on there (I don't know) but definitely for Selank.  And I've done SSRIs...Meditation...Ketamine...Transcranial Brain Stim...therapy.  at the end of the day it really depends on the source of your anxiety.  Although I grew up with abuse...I also had pituitary issues.  Everyone's unique,1684618653,jkyc59m,t3_13lpbv7,t3_13lpbv7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TigerEye408,"I prefer everychems Selank for a more chill out feeling vs the NA Selank which is a chill out but you have motivation to finish your task. 

The regular is ultimate for chilling you out. It could put you to sleep. Or take the edge off a stim. 

The NA-Selank, first 2 bottles I tried, were “calm focus”. I liked that. You weren’t extra tired. You could still work but in a much more chill flow state. 
Absolutely awesome. I

I got another NA-Selank, and it seemed to highly irritate my nasal passages. Like I had a reaction to it. Must’ve been the particular fulfillment batch, since they were out for a while. Definitely nothing like previous two. I have tried it several times to confirm it wasn’t just that day. 
Bummer. Can’t return. But previous two NA-Selank paired well with the work I do. Probably one of my favorite noots. 
 
Since I trust this vendor, I will go back to the original Selank. Because I liked the way it took off the edge and relaxed me. 
Also 
Look in to their Semax and NA-Semax, I prefer NA Semax, for the stimulation/motivation. This is the best mixture I have had. And really “heightened things”. Good light motivation. Hard to explain. 

But all in all.

FreshFrozenLux,"Selank is great potency was decent from EC. A bit costly, but the other products make up for that.

It has a short term effect but it’s true effect is over the span of two -4weeks where you just feel more stress resistant and can think more clearly. You should be in a routine and enhancing it with selank, not using it as a motivator like adderal or a benzo. It won’t help a ton for panic attacks but is a great additive.

mrmczebra,"After 30 years of therapy and over 35 medications, it turns out that my anxiety is most likely caused by an overactive HPA axis, and what works is medications that reduce the effects of noradrenaline.

EchoingSimplicity,">I accept there are some very specific exceptions, but not many.

This is a classic rhetorical move. ""Sure, there's some exceptions, but they're super rare."" So rare, in fact, that they might as well not exist, huh?

Well, a few things. First, anxiety *disorder* isn't rational. It's just a webbing of thoughts interlinked which have been imbued with fear.

Also, physiological anxiety exists, obviously. Raising CO2 levels causes people to panic. There can be other environmental triggers for anxiety. Sometimes people just have an imbalance, which leaves them prone to panic.

Panic attacks themselves have a pretty clear pathology in the brain as an interplay between the amygdala and regions that are supposed to inhibit it, but lose their ability to do so.

Consider this as well: Xanax stops anxiety. Yeah, that seems like a dumb point to make, but really, think about it! Changing chemicals in the brain eliminates anxiety. Sure, maybe introspection and inner journeys can fix it, too.

But it's undeniable that there's an important chemical component here. So important, in fact, that it can completely eliminate anxiety. Does this mean anxiety is a 'brain problem' or a 'psychology problem'? Both.

Not to say that people should be taking Xanax all the time for their anxiety. I'm just using it to illustrate my point: anxiety is simultaneously an issue of neurochemistry and psychology.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

I really see it like this: if the underlying brain chemistry is the problem, psychology can only help someone cope, but can't make it go away.

You're right that anxiety is often a psychological issue, but it's also often a chemical issue. But, the differences is, if we had perfect drug pharmacology and an understanding of the brain, we could cure anxiety in everyone. While, if we perfected psychology, we could only cure some people's anxiety.

Psychology can help people disrupt the thought patterns they've built on top of what they feel, but it isn't able to change brain chemistry (at least, not broadly and potently, like with pharmacology).",1684594863,jkws09i,t3_13lpbv7,t1_jkrnb54,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
