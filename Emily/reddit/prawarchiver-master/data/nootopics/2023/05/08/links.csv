I already had good experiences with Gotu Kola, Lemon Balm, Inositol, Thiamine and Black Seed Oil for mood & anxiety so I would like to add (some of) them. I'm just not sure about what if they are taken together as I've always tried them out alone before.

My stack could consist of following **mains for depression, anxiety & cognition**:

* Bacopa
* Gotu Kola
* Lemon Balm
* Inositol
* Black Seed Oil
* Rhodiola Rosea
* Silexan (Lavender extract)
* Lions Mane Mushroom

...and following **general minerals/vitamins**:

* Zinc & Selenium
* Vitamin Complex
* Vitamin C
* Vitamin B1 aka ""Thiamine""
* Fish Oil

Any of these that significantly helped you with mood, anxiety, social anxiety/sociability and/or cognition (ADD like symptoms, bad memory, bad focus)? If yes, which ones?

What would be your recommendation of a good stack consisting of the supplements mentioned above as I have all of these at home but I just don't know how it would be best to create a stack out of them, which ones to put together and which ones to let alone.

I'm thankful for any recommendations, also other supplements that mentioned, and ideas for a stack possible to create out of these for mainly social anxiety but also mood & cognition.
