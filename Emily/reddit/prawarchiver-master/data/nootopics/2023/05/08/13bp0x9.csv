Sulbutiamine/benfotiamine

Watch out for the hormonal effects of some of those herbs like Lions Mane and Lavender for example",1683561183,jjclcc9,t3_13bp0x9,t3_13bp0x9,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,"Way too many herbal acheis. IN Bromantane and Tongkat Ali are good for social anxiety, maybe Tropisetron as well. For mood Saffron extract from ND or Affron, Nigella Sativa extract from ND and/or Polygala extract from ND are what I would recomment. Don't recommend Lavender (anti-androgenic) or LM (can be anxiogenic and lowers DHT).",1683652539,jjhrqxi,t3_13bp0x9,t3_13bp0x9,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Decent start for herbals, but you'll want to look into nootropics well. Personally, I might try something like this:

Gotu Kolu, Rhodiola Rosea, and Lion's Mane during the day. Lemon balm I'd use more as needed, depending on whether it's a proprietary form or not.

I've personally had good results with Cyracos Lemon Balm extract (ND carries it, though you can find it elsewhere). Far less sedating and impairing than their standard extract. Dose to tolerance; 300mg is usually sufficient for either ND extract for me.

Be aware that lemon balm is both a acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and GABA transaminase inhibitor. These are the enzymes responsible for breaking down acetylcholine and GABA. You may want to look into this, potentially affects other substances; for instance, GABAergics tend to be potentiated somewhat.

For Bacopa, the proprietary form does matter. Synapsa before bed is generally considered to be the least impairing. If you find bacopa doesn't impair you, feel free to dose whenever. I think Bacognize is also supposed to be effective. I'm not a fan personally (of the herb in general) b/c I don't find it effective for me.

Though I've not tried Gotu Kolu personally, it is supposed to be decent. It's actually on my list of potential herbs to try. I've heard that it actually upregulates the GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase)  enzyme, similarly to pregabalin, though less effectively.

Rhodiola is great, but conked out for me after a while. Black Seed Oil (or Nigella Sativa extract) is pretty good (I've only tried ND's Nigella Sativa extract), not sure where it fits in, though. Not familiar with lavender extract.

All of your vitamins look good to me.

Herbs I'd recommend:
- Polygala tenuifolia 20:1 extract
- affron Saffron extract (https://a.co/d/6nrxLNr)

Poly is my rock. Great herb for anxiety and mood. Some people get better effects taking it sublingually. Recently grabbed some affron (proprietary form) Saffron, good results on stress and anxiety thus far.

While it's geared more towards anhedonia, I would highly recommend checking out the following post. It has been my go-to guide for anxiety and depression nootropics:
