Shawesh90,Sublingual with a tiny bit of olive oil works great for me. Even 5-10mg are very noticable.,1685263543,jlx8b4q,t3_13trzhh,t3_13trzhh,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

kinderstander,"After spraying, lay down and tilt your head for 5 min so it flows towards your brain. You have to keep it longer for sublingual absorption.",1685286170,jly8riy,t3_13trzhh,t3_13trzhh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Black_Cat_Fujita,"I got very inconsistent results with oral and sublingual. Tried various dosing and solvents, too. I was highly skeptical about the intranasal until I tried it. I’ve gotten very consistent results with it (and with much smaller doses) with the exception that the sprayer bottle unpredictably needs to be primed sometimes and this causes an incomplete dose- especially when the bottle is only 5-10% full.",1685313419,jm00sof,t3_13trzhh,t3_13trzhh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Black_Cat_Fujita,"I asked the same general question and someone shared the link below. Special additional thing that’s specific to the bromantane spray, though: it tends to want to run right out of your nose even when sprayed properly. What some people have discovered is a way to keep it in so it can be absorbed. After spraying, you lean your head back and kind of slowly rock your head from side to side while it’s tipped back. This rolls the liquid over lots of surface area in the nasal cavity so it stays in there. Some people lay on their sides for a few.

Black_Cat_Fujita,Standing. Takes 30-45 seconds for me. It’s a little bit of trouble but highly effective,1685322087,jm0iklw,t3_13trzhh,t1_jm0bioe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
