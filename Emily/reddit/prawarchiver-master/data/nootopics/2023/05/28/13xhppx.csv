D2_Agonist_Master,I did recently have a horrible bad trip on DXM which resulted in insanely good verbal fluency a couple days later with the afterglow. What was your experience like?,1685643803,jmic3le,t3_13xhppx,t3_13xhppx,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"This is really interesting nonetheless.  I never heard of DXM boosting AMPA or verbal and working memory.

Back in my days of active addiction (to booze and other drugs) I would do a DXM trip once or twice a month.  But I was too much of a degenerate at the time to tell if it made a difference.

How long after the trip do you notice the memory boost?",1685731533,jmnc198,t3_13xhppx,t3_13xhppx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
orbitalLlama,"I'm coming down right now, lol. I’ve been doing one 300mg trip once a month since, and It’s been helping my verbal fluency/ reading ability quite a bit.  I haven't been able to replicate the level of verbal fluency I got from the first trip because that was around 600-700 mg, and I don't want to go that high in dose again because it’s such a shit experience. Even the 300mg trips suck. There’s nothing pleasant about this drug for me apart from the after affects. Hence why I’m on this sub lol.",1685644610,jmiea2e,t3_13xhppx,t1_jmic3le,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
