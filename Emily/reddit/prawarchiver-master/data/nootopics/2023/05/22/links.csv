My father is struggling with early stages of dementia. He is easily overwhelmed, reduced short term memory, lack of interest in activities. etc. He was recently put on Lexapro by his GP and it seems to be helping with the depression but I can tell her needs more for cognition. I was considering trying the following for him:

Tropisetron

Tak 653

DHA-500

Agmatine Sulfate

Does anyone have experience giving seniors any of these compounds? especially Tak? Is there any reason not to mix these substances with Lexapro?

I’ve noticed drastic improvements in my executive function and I finally feel like I have control over the impulsivity that adderal and vyvanse could never help with. 

I finally feel ready to start taking certification exams again, but I was wondering what this subs thoughts were on what to pair with these two amazing chems?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Question about stacking,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/13qmj7z/question_about_stacking/

Transporter Selectivity 
“Originally it had been reported that Tesofensine has IC50 of 8.0, 3.2 and 11.0nM at the DAT, NAT and 5HTT.[11] More recently, though, the following data was submitted: IC50 (nM) NE 1.7, SER 11, DA 65.[[12] cited in [13]] The revised IC50's would adequately explain the lack of efficacy in treating Parkinson's disease, i.e. insufficient DRI potency relative to the SERT and the NET. This could also help account for why Tesofensine is not reliably self-administered by human stimulant abusers[14] since it has been believed to be the case that DAT inhibition is necessary for this and not NET inhibition.[15][16]”

It apparently has a cholinergic component that seems significant enough to mention but not do a little more research on and and shows possible benifit on depression.

Besides being effective for weight loss I really can’t find much on it I. It’s really expensive but it’s really a pretty novel substance to come to the market.
I”m really looking for something to augment the j147 I’m taking with slightly transient but great success. 

Anyone have any experience or thoughts?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tesofesine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/13oghn7/tesofesine/
