taktician-653,"Hi! Created this account so I could comment on this post.  


I also enjoy the benefits of taking TAK and bromantane daily. I combine them with agmatine and neboglamine. 

  
For context, I used to be on very high doses of stimulants for \~ 7 years. Then switched to modafinil (which I take on occasion but not often), which couldn't really help me the way the stims did. The above 4 compounds together, though, have transformed my personal, social and professional life.  


Neboglamine feels similar to TAK and taking them together, in my first person experience, just makes me even better cognitively. Agmatine has been a wonderful addition, as it has helped greatly with my ability to socialize, handle unexpected and unwanted ""surprises"", etc.  


The first three (bromantane, TAK, and Nebo) improved motivation, focus and ability to synthesize thoughts, solve problems, and hold larger problems ""in my mind"" (working memory, I suppose). They didn't do as much for me in terms of sociability, flexibility, etc. Agmatine topped it off nicely as it made me a nicer person to myself and others, haha.",1684952294,jlgid39,t3_13qmj7z,t3_13qmj7z,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Good writeup, but I'd strongly disagree that Neboglamine feels similar to TAK. It's a very interesting substance with definite potential.

That said, I ultimately gave up on TAK, as it just made me feel ""off"" in an unpleasant way. I suspect this was due to the known issues many seem to have with THC/cannabis use and TAK.

I have nothing against it, definitely think it's worth a try. I liked Nebo quite a lot initially, but it seems to have stopped producing acute effects. I'd try higher dosages (typically take 40-50mg oral), but if that's necessary it's financially unsustainable for me.",1685129845,jlqjfuj,t3_13qmj7z,t1_jlgid39,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Optimal_Shape_2916,"Interesting - how would you characterize the differences between tak and nebo?

To me, they have similar stimulatory feeling. However, I am able to distinguish them from each other; nebo has an obvious emotional component to it (for me) where I actually FEEL like I’m doing better, whereas TAK is very strictly cognitive in the sense that it is obvious to me that I am more articulate, more creative, better able to form connections between concepts, etc. While I also experience this from Nebo, I do not seem to experience the last benefit “connecting ideas” quite as much from Nebo",1685131677,jlqnljs,t3_13qmj7z,t1_jlqjfuj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Intel81994,"thanks for this, absolutely LOVE modafinil but it's a bit too much sometimes even if I only take 100mg. Keeps me up. I believe in taking min effective dose and sporadically. Got some TAK, trying 4mg today and I notice studies used 6mg so will try that. Really want to aid my executive function as well. Also trying mantra meditation and seeing how it goes!

I used to have a vyvanse script back in high school but not trying to use amphetamine like that daily. Meh. Prefer coffee/noots/kratom.",1694103074,jzjp5vv,t3_13qmj7z,t1_jlgr2qk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

taktician-653,"Oh, sorry :/ I guess because of the significant difference it has made it my life (and as a corollary, my earning power) it feels cheap for “what I get” in return.
