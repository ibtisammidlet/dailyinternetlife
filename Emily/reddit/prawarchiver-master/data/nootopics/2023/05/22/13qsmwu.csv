PapaverOneirium,"I would look into Dihexa. It’s been shown to have results with improving cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer's disease-like mental impairment with minimal to no toxicity.

I’ve considered trying to get my dad on it for age related cognitive decline. There’s some clinics that provide dihexa therapy but they can be quite expensive.",1684953950,jlgmuoy,t3_13qsmwu,t3_13qsmwu,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

DidNotVote2020,"Very experimental, but you could look into ""Turnbuckle Alzheimer's protocol — dissolve & detoxify"" on longecity. 

Creatine, gylnac (gylcine and NAC), Cerebrolysin/Cortexin, low dose sublingual cialis (assuming no issues with low BP/RHR or heart in general), taurine, low dose naltrexone, and increasing DHA/ALA intake are on the safer side off the top of my head.

The melatonin + creatine combo is effective for slowing progression, particularly melatonin as it increases* amyloid clearance, but in older people it stays in their system longer, making them sleepy throughout the day. It's not recommended medically as it increases falling risk in a demographic where every injury is a serious incident. It's worth considering if they tolerate it well.",1685154700,jls07y8,t3_13qsmwu,t3_13qsmwu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
neuro__atypical,"I would add intranasal Cortexin to that list. Seniors should respond to most drugs similarly to younger people, but they might need lower doses. Taking any of those with Lexapro is fine.",1684952033,jlghnpp,t3_13qsmwu,t3_13qsmwu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

zodiactree,"Would require a lot of effort on your father’s part but there seems to be a lot of anecdotal evidence saying that Ketogenic diets + healthy fats like MCT oil can help with dementia. 

Maybe NSI-189 or lion’s mane as well… but again, kind of speculative. 

Seems like cerebrolysin or cortexin would be promising but I haven’t tried it yet personally.",1685313775,jm01jg3,t3_13qsmwu,t3_13qsmwu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
tallr0b,"For a short term memory, my 98-year-old mother-in-law responds very obviously to just 25mg of TAU (triacetyluridine) every morning.

She used to ask a question, get an answer, and ask the same question an hour or two later.   TAU completely stopped that.  Two days after I ran out, she started doing it again.   I don’t run out anymore ;)   And … I take it more often myself ;).  BTW — only take it in the morning.  It is energizing and can interfere with sleep.

She also regularly takes AlphaGPC and DHA — basically, the “Mr. Happy Stack”.",1686541805,jnv29bf,t3_13qsmwu,t3_13qsmwu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,Hadn’t considered dihexa. I know the risks and given his age might be a decent risk reward there,1684956149,jlgsq1w,t3_13qsmwu,t1_jlgmuoy,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
