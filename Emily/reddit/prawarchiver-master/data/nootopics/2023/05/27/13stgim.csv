D2_Agonist_Master,"I’m on day 15 of my first time taking 9-me-bc for treating marijuana induced anhedonia, and so far I can say that I have a subtle boost to zest for life and confidence. Things are a bit better in general as far as enjoyment so I’m excited to see how this will go (plan on doing at least a 60 day cycle). However, due to it being subtle so far I also am not expecting to be completely cured from it.

As a side note, I recently had my first Psilocybin experience a couple days ago and it was 100% positive and just amazing. This was not always the case with substances that greatly “played around” with my psyche big time prior to starting 9mebc.
