Good-dayayy,"It sounds like you are making some great strides and lead a pretty healthy life. It may be fine to take all 3 together but one way to look at it is that Cerebrolysin is such a big hitter within this sphere and not cheap either, so giving it a full cycle without significant confounding variables (I.e. tak and nebo) will give you a better idea of how it is affecting you and how to move forward with it or not. Tak and/or nebo will be waiting for you after the cycle and can keep the BDNF train moving forward so to speak. 

I’m not sure about neurodegeneration as a result of BDNF but I have certainly experienced the side effect of expedited hair loss from running long cycles of BDNF promoting agents. It’ll grow back, but still, not ideal lol. My take away from this experience is that balance really is key and there can be too much of a good thing. Just my 2¢.",1683688119,jjk4dzt,t3_13d7z66,t3_13d7z66,13,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"I've taken all three before, no problem. It's impossible to say whether it will be too much or not. Like, there's no data, and any neuroscientist or pharmacologist will shrug their shoulders and tell you it's impossible to know without a formal study. I'd say, go ahead and take all three and see if there's any issue. If not, then you should be good, so long as you look out for any potential issues.

Also, neboglamine is **not** an NMDA antagonist. It does **not** share the same mechanism of action as ketamine. It is in fact an NMDA positive allosteric modulator (PAM), meaning it potentiates the effects of a ligand such as glutamate when binding to it. Its closer to being opposite to ketamine in that sense, though that isn't a very scientific statement.",1683676539,jjjf78i,t3_13d7z66,t3_13d7z66,11,False,t5_4aoxhu

Good-dayayy,"I agree that you can assess a new addition in relation to one’s stack if it’s their baseline as well :) When considering the main concern and question that op has about the potential for “excess” neuroplasticity, my primary point was that the stack of CBL, tak and nebo likely won’t result in degeneration but could be a bit heavy handed and unnecessary.

BigWhat55535,"Cerebrolysin's effects are indeed broad, but it's important to consider the nuance of potency here. It's a constitution of many different peptides, most of which we have no understanding of. So, I'd call into question this:

Imagine a number that goes up to 100%, representing the effects of cerebrolysin. How much does each individual peptide contribute to this number?

Maybe there's just one, wonder peptide in cerebrolysin that contributes 99% of the effects. Maybe it's ten peptides to make the 99%, or a hundred, or a thousand. Who knows?

Point is, while indeed cerebrolysin is 'broad' in its effect, due to having many, many peptides. I have to ask how much that's relevant.

A hundred peptides that do a hundred different things, but with only one of them having enough potency to exert any noticeable effect is much more narrow in reality than it would be on paper.

So these scientific journals will talk about BDNF, VEGF, Nrf2, Glutamatergic receptor upregulation, and all of this stuff, because cerebrolysin does have all of those effects, but now you have to actually go and find which is SIGNIFICANT.

Is BDNF the big player here? Or is it VEGF? Both? Neither? Just because Cerebrolysin 'does' BDNF doesn't mean it's actually relevant.",1683732061,jjm2y2d,t3_13d7z66,t1_jjjkuqz,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

EchoingSimplicity,"I see, I didn't know that, thanks. Though, the effect is ultimately positive, right? So, I think it would get classified as a positive allosteric modulator in the literature. Just like how 'agonist' is used even when the effect is indirect--i.e., ""Atomoxetine agonizes norepinephrine"" <-- an NRI, technically. But a net agonistic effect, ultimately.

What do you think?",1683988584,jk0457t,t3_13d7z66,t1_jjzxivy,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
mikorbu,"In a layman’s discussion, you’re absolutely right— those differences aren’t typically important enough to derail the topic or lead to incorrect conclusions.

But in terms of RC’s (and all the lovely and infinitely muddled sides of neuro) something like Neboglamine’s dual PAM activity can uniquely displace or work around antagonized NMDA receptors in a way that, for instance, Sarcosine cannot— even though it’s increasing potentials from another end. Or something like pure Glycine which, despite being a primary driver of NMDA activity, has an entire slew of other effects.

But again it’s just semantics in regard to most PAM’s— but I do want to nudge on the Atomoxetine example since it’s an entire different case!

As an NRI, turning off the vacuum allows for the potential for more norepinephrine family receptors to be activated— which is a basic function of most of the ADHD stimulant treatment class. But an agonist is a whole different ball-game, since it means the compound activates receptors directly. And often potently enough to displace native binding and/or internalize receptors to cause tolerance after enough stress— as seen with things like d2 agonist withdrawals. 

Agonists are much more specific in scope of action than PAM’s or reuptake inhibitors, and a direct “norepinephrine-esque agonist” is more in line with emergency treatments for anaphylaxis, surgeries, trauma-induced bradycardia etc.— and would definitely not behave like your typical dose of Wellbutrin :)

Also (for the love of any and all deities of choice), please feel free to correct me friends! Still armchair learning even after all these years, and I’d never turn down a free speed-run through this brain maze hellscape.",1684641633,jkzmbdy,t3_13d7z66,t1_jk0457t,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
