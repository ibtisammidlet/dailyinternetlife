The only lifestyle change I havenâ€™t managed to incorporate is an active social life which I believe is due to ongoing mental health challenges. I also take some general nutritional supplements (ALCAR, Vit D + K2, Magtein, etc)

For background: 

I have been dosing 2 mL of TAK-653 and and 30-50mg of Neboglamine for two weeks which has provided a marginal improvement in overall cognition, impulse control, emotional regulation and general well-being. Since starting these noots, I take roughly 10-30mg of IR Adderall as needed which is substantially less than my prescribed dose of 60mg. 

I have recently purchased Cerebrolysin (CBL) from CosmicNootropic with the intention to address two issues:

1. Repair Brain Damage from TBI, PTSD, Substance Abuse

2. Address a Mental Health disorder which is either Bipolar 2, ADHD, or BPD (depending on which psychiatrist you speak to)

Considering that Neboglamine and TAK serve as potent AMPA PAMs as well as NMDAR antagonists, I believe that discontinuing these noots would be advisable during my cycle of CBL. However, I was hoping that this community may be able to provide some insight into how the neurological dynamics would play out with these three supplements. 

My take is that, given the substantial increase BDNF from CBL, TAK and Nebo would lead to excessive neuroplasticity and ultimately prove to be neurodegenerative. 

Any insight, clarification, or contribution that you can provide is greatly appreciated and very welcomed.
