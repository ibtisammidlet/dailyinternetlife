I’m planning to research with both Atomoxetine and Guanfacine. It’s a cookie-cutter combination. 

I’ve had passed success with use of solely Atomoxetine with the only complaint being the hypertension. The other drawbacks were oxidative stress and the non-selective nature. Here’s why I rationalized my use for research:

However, I cycle Selegiline. I just finished a 1 month cycle of 1.25 mg sublingually. Yes, I know, it is likely neurotoxic and not selective. Selegiline works wonders for my depression compared to anything else.

The combination of MAOIs and Atomoxetine can potentially create a hypertensive crisis. I took my last of Selegiline 1.25 sublingual dose 6 days ago. 

How much longer should I wait? I’m a lean build and 175 lbs. I was planning on 12 days total.

Has anyone combined atomoxetine + IN bromantane?
What about atomoxetine + TAK or AMPA PAMs?

I have propranolol on standby at all times regardless. Plus even more Guanfacine if needed lol.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Atomoxetine + Guanfacine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/13sae0i/atomoxetine_guanfacine/
