SunDevil329,"I don't see any issue taking the two together. Bacopa primarily targets serotonin. Pregabalin is a gabapentenoid with a somewhat complex MoA; it inhibits certain calcium channels.

While I won't pretend to understand the pharmacology, my understanding is that it blunts/dampens nerve signaling (calms damaged or overactive nerves), resulting in its anxiolytic and analgesic effects.

If anything, the combination might make you more lethargic, tired, and/or fatigued. One possible solution would be dosing the bacopa prior to sleep.",1683127953,jipij0i,t3_136fmsk,t3_136fmsk,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

MrNeverEverKnew,Can you elaborate why Bacopa might blunt the Lyrica effects?,1683197257,jitc4en,t3_136fmsk,t1_jirwesb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Rude-Lettuce-8982,Well for me personally Lyrica was quite euphoric and bacopa can cause anhedonia in some. I imagine that would clash a bit.,1683198447,jitdt2d,t3_136fmsk,t1_jitc4en,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
