CryptoEscape,"great questions, but I can only offer speculation.  

Racetams, which also strongly affect AMPA receptors, are speculated to contribute to Amphetamine neurotoxicity.  Iâ€™m not quite sure why, but I suspect itâ€™s because AMPA PAMâ€™s can potentiate endogenous glutamate.  Dopamine also co releases with glutamate, and excess glutamate causes excitotoxicity.  However, excess dopamine also plays a big role in Amphetamineâ€™s neurotoxicity.

Now NAC may be able to counteract some of this neurotoxicity (again only speculation.). Possibly L-Theanine too.  NAC reduces effects of Amphetamine for some people, but Iâ€™ve not noticed that.

Methylphenidate may be a safer option to use with AMPA PAMâ€™s.  

Iâ€™ve used TAK generally an hour before I will most need it.  It doesnâ€™t appear to disrupt sleep IME.  Edit:  It may be stimulating for some people 

Itâ€™s hard to say if it has cumulative effects.  Iâ€™ve read another comment saying it has both acute and cumulative effects.  Racetams (which are also usually AMPA PAMâ€™s) tend to mainly have cumulative effects.  However, AMPA agonists like Noopept tend to mainly have acute effects, and lose efficacy over longer periods (aka tolerance)

Please note Iâ€™m not an expert, Iâ€™m just speculating here, trying to give you things to consider and research, and get the conversation started.  Anyone feel free to correct me.",1683127176,jipgj3b,t3_136ihen,t3_136ihen,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
Turbulent_Zone_5324,"1. Yes, they can be taken together but their interaction profile is unknown, so be cautious if youâ€™re planning on taking them both long-term. IME, TAK-653 potentiates both my D-Amphetamine (Dexedrine) and Lisdexamphetamine (Elvanse), so I lower my Amph dosage when combining them. Itâ€™s best (health-wise) to completely stop taking Amphetamines, obviously.

2. Since TAK-653 is glutamatergic/stimulating, itâ€™s recommended to take it in the morning. It seems to anecdotally cause insomnia for some, especially when taken later in the morning.

3. According to SirSad, the cognitive benefits stay even after cessation, but I havenâ€™t stopped taking it for less than one day â€˜yetâ€™, so I canâ€™t confirm this myself.",1683122813,jip5nya,t3_136ihen,t3_136ihen,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
