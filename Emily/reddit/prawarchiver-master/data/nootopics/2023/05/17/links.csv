I do have some questions regarding interactions and some of the benefits if anyone can help chime in!

&#x200B;

1. Anyone know how this might interact with adderall or stims? I was thinking of using or trying a very low dose of MB near the end/mid day when the adderall is wearing off.
2. Anyone have any experiences with it regarding social interaction and or anhedonia?
