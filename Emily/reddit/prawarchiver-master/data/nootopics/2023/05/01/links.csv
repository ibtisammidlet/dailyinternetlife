I've been using NAC to help ween down and I've cut back significantly. I have ADHD and alcohol just helps calms my brain down. Allows me to sleep, I actually feel better the morning after drinking.

I currently take an SNRI for depression and have done for several years which has helped to an extent, SSRI's made my anhedonia 10x worse.

I've read that often with people who abuse alcohol, the issue is a reduction in GABA and an excess in Glutamate.

Anyone in a similar position found anything that works??",False,t5_4aoxhu,A stack to repair Alcohol induced anhedonia?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/135h9y0/a_stack_to_repair_alcohol_induced_anhedonia/

I spent the weekend going down the Peat rabbithole and it turns out a lot of them apply topicals on their balls as well for similar purposes (androgenic/test optimization).
