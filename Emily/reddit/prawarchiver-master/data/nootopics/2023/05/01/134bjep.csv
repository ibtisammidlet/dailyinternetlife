entavias,Iâ€™ve used 11-keto testosterone which I think is the closest available now but not on my balls seems like a risky place for applying topicals,1682917845,jiebsjd,t3_134bjep,t3_134bjep,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

0phenyl,"I believe the Ray Peaters have switched to naval application with alcohol solutions at \~80% bioavailability. 

I don't see an issue with applying topicals to the balls though, at least in the mid-term timeframe. Perhaps in a few years I'll switch to naval.

Anecdotally, a couple people have mentioned that it didn't change the effects that much when applying Pregnenolone, DHEA, T3, etc. I'll have to see myself before I can confirm though.",1682962368,jigfd55,t3_134bjep,t1_jiebsjd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

entavias,"Iâ€™ve always struggled with sticking with the gym because I donâ€™t notice a change quickly enough and end up giving up, also have a seasonal job that makes it impossible to keep up with the gym year round, but this winter I was going to the gym for 5 months at least 3 times a week and used various supplements and some prohormones and such. I didnâ€™t run 11-Keto solo but I definitely think it had an effect. Subjectively it seemed to affect where the fat I was losing was coming off and impact muscle growth. Iâ€™ve always had a larger tummy as part of my body shape and with 11-keto and excercise my body definition changed and I lost more of the belly and gained muscle more in the upper back/chest/shoulders/arms. It also seems to have stayed that way despite going from consistent workouts in the gym to just trying to keep up with doing some at home exercise semi-consistently.

Definitely going to cycle it again when I am able to get back into a consistent workout routine. I feel like it subtly changed my body composition towards what Iâ€™d like.",1686000981,jn1hfna,t3_134bjep,t1_jn1e9cw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
