Humancyclone7,"I think Cistanche and Royal Jelly can both increase GDNF expression.

9-Me-BC can increase GDNF, CDNF, BDNF, NGF and Sonic Hedgehog Protein.",1683045792,jikzbnk,t3_135ghd5,t3_135ghd5,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

geophilo,"However, bromantane seems to blunt the effects of dri's for me so I take either Ritalin or bromantane. Not both. Polygala is useful also.",1683055001,jiln3hh,t3_135ghd5,t1_jilmyx7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
wookmaster69,"Not trying to hate on you, but I hate that in every sub about supps/nootropics or anything health wise people recommend tyrosine so often. There’s a couple of studies and a lot of evidence that tyrosine supplements can increase the risk of people developing melanoma, especially people who are predisposed to skin cancer. It’s not something most people should be worried about if they’ve taken tyrosine at some point but it just is not a safe supplement, especially to recommend to random people over the internet. Everyone just talks about tyrosine all the time. There’s very little scientific proof that tyrosine supplements effect dopamine whatsoever. And practically no studies at all that show it’s made any significant impact on dopamine production. Plus it’s possible that it’s pretty fuckin dangerous. Not to hate on you man. it’s probably the most recommended supplement in general. It’s just frustrating.",1683099310,jio5onm,t3_135ghd5,t1_jilmyx7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Appropriate_Donkey18,"I honestly was thinking about this as well. I will probably be down voted for this, but all those supplements OP has mentioned taking, haven't been studied to reliable extend. 

They haven't been studied at all when combined.

And then there's a thing as too high neurotrophic levels, which don't benefit the brain either.

I still think working out is the golden ticket against anhedonia. And it doesn't need to be high intense. Just walking the woods can do the trick already.",1683083824,jini6l8,t3_135ghd5,t1_jin4af7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

AdeptDescription2540,Thank you! Have you noticed if the blunting results in longer duration tho? Im thinking it might prevent dopamine from releasing too fast thus making the effect smoother and longer lasting?,1683060363,jim0o58,t3_135ghd5,t1_jiln3hh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

geophilo,I notice NA-Semax elongates and strengthens the effects of dri's but with bromantane it feels like I might as well not have taken it. But there is a stimulating effect from bromantane + tyrosine. Just seems to negate Ritalin in my experience.,1683060510,jim1163,t3_135ghd5,t1_jim0o58,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

geophilo,NASA is wonderful. It gives me more confidence and reduces anxiety on top of improved mentation. NA-Semax is more stimulating in my experience. Better for exams/intense focus.,1683060805,jim1rnl,t3_135ghd5,t1_jim1dzm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
