FormFabulous7000,Did you ever find out? Its a great research question so everyone can have an idea of what to expect with hematocrit and hemoglobin levels,1700258155,k9ow352,t3_12m5je1,t3_12m5je1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

limitless1370,"I don’t think he has a poor customer service. He gets bombarded with silly questions like this. If you see the description it’s 30 days supply and the container has 1500mg which gives you 50mg/day. As it mentioned above, this RC is not being sold for human consumption, and sold for laboratory research purpose only so don’t expect a reply for dosage protocol",1681530052,jgbgik9,t3_12m5je1,t1_jg9ols8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"He does not sell these things for human consumption, so he can not tell you. However, I have heard that 100-120mg 3x/week is the current standard.",1681521887,jgb179r,t3_12m5je1,t1_jg9ols8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ArcticPlatypus,"I think the best bet is to go off of dosages used in the research with a 3x per week approach. Probably 70 mg per dose, but after several months that dosage can go down to 40-50mg. I stopped using it mostly out of laziness and cost, but the cost did come down a bit on everychem so I might reconsider bringing it back in to the mix, as I do see the value in targeting such a unique pathway for both cognitive benefits as well as exercise performance.",1700258793,k9oxnu5,t3_12m5je1,t1_k9ow352,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ArcticPlatypus,The point of the question was because the scientific papers on Roxadustat specifically refer to a 3x per week dosing protocol. Definitely doesn’t appear to be something that’s designed to be taken daily. Was just curious if anybody else had more insight on what’s best or any personal experience with the compound.,1681677810,jgizfak,t3_12m5je1,t1_jgbgik9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
FormFabulous7000,Its just interesting no one mentioning the effects on hct/hg levels.,1700259252,k9oys3g,t3_12m5je1,t1_k9oxnu5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
FormFabulous7000,Yes 70mg three times per week seems the starting point. Thx,1700357089,k9u2thj,t3_12m5je1,t1_k9oxnu5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Available-Raccoon507,"Hey, can I ask, how did you take the roxadustat? It comes as a powder from that source, so did u weigh the 70mg and dissolve in water?? Tha ks",1700518678,ka2r377,t3_12m5je1,t1_k9oxnu5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ArcticPlatypus,"I just weighed it and put it in the mouth, washed down with water, no need to dissolve in water first. You could also load the powder into capsules, although it is more effort that way.",1701038142,kawa9jm,t3_12m5je1,t1_ka2r377,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
