sirsadalot,"This study doesn't mean what you think it means. It shows despite increased protein density *in aged rodents*, and it didn't effect the binding of MK-801, a NMDA antagonist. Also, since it was used in aged rodents, it draws the cholinergic or antioxidant mechanisms of Piracetam into question.

The increased density could be superficial, as receptor density seldom aligns with expectations. However it's known that NMDA currents increase downstream of AMPA positive allosteric modulation, which Piracetam possesses as its primary mechanism of action.

To answer you directly, though, no Piracetam is not a NMDA agonist. And on the topic of NMDA antagonists, acutely they impair cognition and chronically can produce psychotic symptoms. Memantine is also an a7 nicotinic antagonist, and the a7 nicotinic receptor is important for cognition. And it antagonizes extrasynaptic NMDA which can result in intensified social defeat/ trauma. Likely why it did not succeed as an antidepressant in comparison to other NMDA antagonists.",1681256889,jfwamlq,t3_12ivf7d,t3_12ivf7d,1,True,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"The glycine site is so interesting.

What are the best ways to modulate it?  How does Piracetam affect it?",1681251856,jfvz341,t3_12ivf7d,t1_jfvtzo1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"Idk about Piracetam, but I doubt it has selectivity for the glycine site. Piracetam's main effect is to do with AMPA anyways. The best selective PAM for the glycine site is Neboglamine.",1681258032,jfwd95y,t3_12ivf7d,t1_jfvz341,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
