Yupyup287904,"It may just not work for some people.  I started yesterday afternoon with 5 sprays over a 2 hour period,  did 10 sprays and 10 sublingual doses all day today and pretty much just short spans where I’m really concentrated and can’t tell if it’s doing anything or if it’s placebo.   I’m going to give it a few more days.

I tried Noopept last week for 5 days at different doses and roa’s, felt nothing.",1681262440,jfwnf5t,t3_12ixc91,t3_12ixc91,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,One spray per nostril is a very small dose. Most people do 2-3 each…also it’s not a super stimulating substance it’s more of systemic stress reducer and also improves dopaminergic system with repeated use. some do find it stimulating but for me its effects are more subtle and long lasting than acute,1681247616,jfvor1y,t3_12ixc91,t3_12ixc91,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"Don't sniff to hard or the caprylic acid will go down the back of your throat, and it will not absorb intranasally which is suboptimal. Make sure you are doing the spray form correctly, you will know this if there is minimal leakage out of your nose, or into your throat. If you still can't feel much after 2 sprays, try 4 and you will likely notice the stimulant effects unless you are a non-responder or noceboing.",1681249851,jfvubov,t3_12ixc91,t3_12ixc91,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Guys, don't we have to complement these Nootropics (they don't work in isolation no?) with a well-balanced lifestyle i.e. exercise, meditation, good diet,  and good sleep? It seems to work for me.
