Vye7,The nasal spray does seem to have a poor dispensing mechanism compared to regular sprays I’ve used. Always dripping from both ends for me. I’ve been thinking the same of just using it oral,1681204780,jft1tot,t3_12i68gn,t3_12i68gn,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Yupyup287904,Does bromantane turn your urine yellow like taking vitamins would?  Mine is bright yellow like a b complex but I haven’t taken any vitamins and I don’t believe I’m dehydrated.,1681251270,jfvxpkm,t3_12i68gn,t1_jfugrtw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Yupyup287904,The stuff just does not work for me.  I’ve been mixed dosing more than 30 sprays daily the past few days.  The nasal route has improved in terms of leakage but I’m just a non responder to this and Noopept.  Sucks,1681522723,jgb3019,t3_12i68gn,t1_jgb11h1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,"It’s funny, I love it and rarely have issues with the dripping. That said I think the issue is that it’s not soluble in the other traditional compounds.

And to the OP, yes it will work but you’ll get a fraction of the bioavailability",1681215572,jfth2aq,t3_12i68gn,t1_jft4b1i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
