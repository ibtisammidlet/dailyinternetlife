SunDevil329,"In my experience, picamilon works best as a temporary anxiolytic. I take it from time to time when anxiety/stress are extreme, but only sparingly.

My understanding is that it can build tolerance and dependence if used for extended periods of time. Many people don't really notice much of an effect, tbh.",1681151710,jfq87br,t3_12hqgn6,t3_12hqgn6,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
anton952,"My exp is it doesn't do anything lol. I was taking 300mg 3 times a day for a while (mistook it for niacin, they come in similar bottles over here). Didn't notice much.",1681192805,jfso011,t3_12hqgn6,t3_12hqgn6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Royal-Gorilla,Try racetams. I have very good success with various racetams and PRL-853 for writing Academic papers.  Coluracetam is very good for reading stuff.,1681584689,jge1hu5,t3_12hqgn6,t3_12hqgn6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"I find it better for reflecting on things Iâ€™ve already studied, rather than learning new things.

It puts my mind into a slightly more relaxed state, which allows my mind to slow down a bit and ponder what I read.  Particularly philosophical material, but it could probably help with anything",1681305197,jfyjvbq,t3_12hqgn6,t3_12hqgn6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Rozeu,I see. What dosage do you use?,1681173682,jfromvt,t3_12hqgn6,t1_jfq87br,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Rozeu,"I don't have a strong opinion about racetams. I have already tried piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam and noopept, but without noticing a significant improvement.

I am currently on 15mg of Noopept, 100mg of Oxiracetam, 200mg of Uridine (all sublingual, twice a day). Plus other things orally. This combo I thought was working very well, but today I forgot to take another supplement that I usually take when I have to be productive (dopa mind / avena sativa), and my cognition was not the same. Which leads me to believe that on other days the magic came from dopa mind/avena sativa and not from noopept/oxy/uridine (dopa mind was undoubtedly a great discovery for me).

I've been wanting to try PRL-853 for some time, but it never happened.

About coluracetam, is it safe to take considering that it is a fairly recent product on the market?

Did you feel any kind of improvement in verbal fluency with PRL-853 or with Coluracetam?",1681586066,jge4pz6,t3_12hqgn6,t1_jge1hu5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Typically 50mg, rarely 100mg. Cosmic Nootropics has some decent info on it.

Lasts about 2 hours or so, at which point you can redose if you want. Occasional use should be fine.

Causes light sedation for me at that dosage while remaining mostly alert, if somewhat more relaxed.",1681174278,jfrpz5z,t3_12hqgn6,t1_jfromvt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
