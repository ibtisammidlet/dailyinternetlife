Sprayed both nostrils once each. Its been an hour but I haven't felt anything. Maybe I sprayed it wrong? How far in your nostril do you spray?

I tried the the method of sniffing through the other nostril whilst keep the sprayed nostril closed and vice versa. Any tips?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane spray,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/12ixc91/bromantane_spray/
CryptoEscape,1681242797,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,12ivf7d,False,19,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/12ivf7d/effects_of_piracetam_on_nmda/,1709901427,7,"Some mice studies show Piracetam “enhanced affinity of L-Glutamate for the NMDA receptor.”  

Would this mean piracetam is an NMDA agonist? Are there benefits to this?   It seems we’re often trying to antagonize NMDA (e.g. Memantine) often for neuroprotection, particularly from stimulants.  

Also Piracetam showed increased NMDA receptor density in that same study.  How does this affect cognition and brain health?

And if Piracetam is in fact an NMDA agonist, or at least enhances/ upregulates NMDA, could this mean Piracetam could cause faster development of tolerance to stimulants (since NMDA antagonists are speculated to reduce tolerance?). Possibly even neurotoxicity when combined with stimulants?

Any answers are appreciated.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Effects of Piracetam on NMDA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8234409/

I read that Picamilon improved verbal fluency.

So I've been asking myself... would picamilon be a good nootropic for writing a paper or for studying?
