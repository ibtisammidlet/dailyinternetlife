As far as bromantane's MoA, take a sec to check Wikipedia:

""[B]romantane instead acts via indirect¬†genomic¬†mechanisms to produce a rapid, pronounced, and long-lasting¬†upregulation¬†in a variety of brain regions of the¬†expression¬†of¬†tyrosine hydroxylase¬†(TH) and¬†aromatic¬†L-amino acid decarboxylase¬†(AAAD) (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), key¬†enzymes¬†in the dopamine¬†biosynthesis¬†pathway.""

In layman's terms, it upregulates dopamine.

,"Idk if it's stronger than modafinil, never tried that one myself. Fladrafinil is supposed to also have an ""antiagressive"" effect vs adrafinil and I think the same applies to flmoda as well.

Bromantane doesn't really do much for me but make other stims stronger. Like phenylpiracetam or flmoda. Modafinil is also a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, albeit a weaker one, and I definitely get that effect from flmoda, and it's fairly strong for me,  though I also take 4mg rasalgine daily and it is a MAOi so that likely makes it much stronger than it would be for someone not using a MAOi.",1681516104,jgaopfm,t3_12k06kp,t1_jgakojc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
