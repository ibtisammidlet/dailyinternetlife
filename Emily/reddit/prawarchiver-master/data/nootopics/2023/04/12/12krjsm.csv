SunDevil329,"Shouldn't be an issue. Lexapro is an SSRI and buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT1A agonist. Bromantane utilizes a novel MoA, but I'd say it primarily acts on dopamine, so I don't see an issue.

FWIW, I take similar meds and I have no issues.",1681398505,jg3pa62,t3_12krjsm,t3_12krjsm,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
korboybeats,Ohh okay great to know. Thank you very much,1681398890,jg3q9hx,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg3pa62,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
ldulm77,"in a similar vein, what are your thoughts on interactions between carnosic acid and buspirone?",1681400928,jg3vjoo,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg3pa62,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Tbh, I'd say buspirone is unlikely to cause a serious reaction with anything. It's a very curious medication. Supposedly carnosic does increase serotonin, but the effects of buspirone aren't strong enough to warrant concern IMO.

I take buspirone as well and have taken doses of carnosic acid up to 500mg without any problems.",1681411909,jg4ob9n,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg3vjoo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,I’d say buspirone is unlikely to do anything at all lol,1681418848,jg566cf,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg4ob9n,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ldulm77,Awesome. Thanks for the reply. How do you like the carnosic acid? I just ordered some yesterday,1681413434,jg4s84m,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg4ob9n,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Generally agreed. Only reason I still take it is because it *might* help with the sexual side effects of my SNRI, Cymbalta, according to my pdoc. Since it's largely benign, as you suggest, I figured it can't hurt.",1681419186,jg5721v,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg566cf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lambjenkemead,I like carnosic acid. Is mildly anxiolytic and is also great for general health. It’s expensive however so I use it infrequently,1681418927,jg56djn,t3_12krjsm,t1_jg4s84m,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
