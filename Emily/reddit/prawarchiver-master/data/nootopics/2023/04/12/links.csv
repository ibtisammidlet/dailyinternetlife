I get the sense bromantane would be a let-down of sorts (like all nootropics I've tried tbh), but it's fairly cheap to try. There is no miracle cure out there, but if it could help with depression & motivation and such, that could be cool, even though I'm pessimistic after years of trying so many things that didn't help. I guess I won't know unless I try it msyelf, but wondering if anyone has found it to consistently work well as an antidepressant. There may be better options out there.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Is bromantane good as an antidepressant or not so much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/12k06kp/is_bromantane_good_as_an_antidepressant_or_not_so/
