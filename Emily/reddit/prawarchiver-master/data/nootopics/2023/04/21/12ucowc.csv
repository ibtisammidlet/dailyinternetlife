qdouble,"Going to the gym regularly is one of the most effective ways to boost energy with or without supplements. Then you have:

Bromantane, ALCAR, Caffeine, Creatine, Protein, and high fiber carbs.",1682101691,jh6cbpg,t3_12ucowc,t3_12ucowc,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Caffeine (even first thing in the morning) seems to have a negative impact on my sleep. Food timing is also very important.",1682173404,jh9tp70,t3_12ucowc,t1_jh6cbpg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

neuro__atypical,"how is modafinil not sustainable? millions take it every day. the wakefulness-promoting effect has no tolerance, the dopaminergic action does but that's standard.

wasn't thinking about pitolisant though, that's definitely better.",1682209891,jhc3w2w,t3_12ucowc,t1_jh7aj8r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lord_weasel,"There is definitely a tolerance to most of the effects, even if not the wakefulness effect. In my experience, by the third day in a row, my irritability sky rockets, making it a pretty annoying experience and not worth taking it more than twice. My guess is that the wakefulness is still in affect but the other benefits have stopped, leaving you in a strange limbo.  


It's half-life is incredibly long as well, which is why insomnia comes into play with regular use. People that take it daily generally have disorders like narcolepsy where they have a very serious need to stay awake, despite other effects that might arise from consistent use.",1682443229,jhodawb,t3_12ucowc,t1_jhc3w2w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"I mean it does have tolerance in its effects, and it has the potential to worsen sleep even when taken in the mornings.
