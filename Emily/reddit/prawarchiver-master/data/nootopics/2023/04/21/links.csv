And what else is taken to synergize? 

I’d like to combine Bromantane, Neboglamine, and TAK, the latter in smaller doses. 

I have heard Bromantane, TAK, and tropisetron taken together is the business. 

My reason. Productivity, running a business re branding and webpage. So physical labor and computer. Thank you all in advance. Your answers in the past have been extremely helpful. 

Used to use adderall for computer stuff, and sometimes for product assembly.

I have high thyroid levels I don’t know if this is related but sometimes I have nothing in me for no person. Any supplements or methods to increase energy? Any help is really appreciated.
