I got these products and asked twice for their chemical analysis (which the website states would be available upon request!) and have yet to receive a response.

I have experience with both pharma-grade and lab synthetic Piracetam. The one from everychem provides none of the effects that I used to get. In particular, I have not experienced the increased blood flow to the brain that typically occurs within the first 10-20 minutes of ingestion.

I would be grateful if anyone with experience using Everychemâ€™s products could share their thoughts on their credibility.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Racetams from Everychem?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/12ngwa7/racetams_from_everychem/

MB is a staple and one of the heavy hitters in my stack so I don't want to mess with its activity. Does anyone here have anything to add to the speculation? Any anecdotal info?
