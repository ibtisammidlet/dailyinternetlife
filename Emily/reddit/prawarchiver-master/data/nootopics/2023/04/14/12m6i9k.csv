Bierak,"I could never get the MB to work as it should. The metabolic effects are felt, it is true that it has an interesting effect on cognition but in my case it generates two side effects that I could never resolve 1) Dysuria 2) Vasoconstriction.",1681798324,jgppu6b,t3_12m6i9k,t3_12m6i9k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,Still seems cloudy on whether or not the combination is a good one or not? Can you sum up your thoughts on the combination?,1681680888,jgj6yao,t3_12m6i9k,t1_jgizn3m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Dbdbmama,"Scientifically speaking, seems very unlikely to be an issue of negative side effects, assuming the methylene blue dose is reasonable which in my opinion is 0.5-0.75mg/kg with a hard upper limit of 1mg/kg  


Reports suggest higher metylene blue doses are fine and rarely negative side effects until one goes past 2mg/kg but from my own personal experience, going above 1mg/kg starts to become unstable. Best dose, from my exp is the 0.5-0.75mg/kg  


As for the combination of Idebenone and MB. I have used both in combination on numerous occasions and have not been able to identify any cancelling out of effects.  


Get a solid understanding of what each does for you and then combine them, would be my one line summary.",1681739547,jgm09ku,t3_12m6i9k,t1_jgj6yao,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
