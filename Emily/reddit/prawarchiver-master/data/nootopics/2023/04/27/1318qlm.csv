Ebshoun,"So, are there any anecdotal reports out there?

I'm going to order this soon though. People underestimate what extra oxygen to the brain and other vital organs can do for a human being.",1683142472,jiqjzxv,t3_1318qlm,t3_1318qlm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
harry_lawson,"I think I'll have to order some to try.

I use salbutamol for exercise currently, and it helps. Feel like I can breathe better when it kicks in. Beta aderenoreceptor downregulation is a problem (ignoring ketotifen). 

Roxadustat increases EPO so I'd be interested to see if I get a similar ""I can breathe better"" feeling or enhanced cardio performance.

Anyone guinea pigged yet?",1682641473,jhzoy0f,t3_1318qlm,t3_1318qlm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Many-Hurry-9170,Yes i have a good supplier and have been on it for the last 5 weeks now. I have been using for athletic performances and it has been amazing for me. DM for more information.,1693753458,jyyfga9,t3_1318qlm,t3_1318qlm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jazzlike_Study4971,Roxadustat has ‘non-superior’ effects to EPO in dialysis patients. Daprodustat also is an option. Has anyone got experience with this? I see you can buy daprodustat from china,1696528412,k3lt26r,t3_1318qlm,t3_1318qlm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

harry_lawson,"It's a prescription asthma medication. I use 4mg oral 3x per day with 150mg caffeine and 200mg L theanine. Burns calories, helps lean muscle gain, dilates bronchioles. Tolerance builds, so you can cycle or take another drug called ketotifen which sensitises the downregulated receptors.",1682765247,ji63za3,t3_1318qlm,t1_ji3m9fr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
harry_lawson,"Clen is bad for your heart. Salbutamol is too, but to a much lesser degree. The sides for Sal are more manageable than Clen.

Problem with ketotifen is the side effects. Along with its own list of sides, it's mechanism fucks with histamine which can affect mood and things.",1682765840,ji64q1p,t3_1318qlm,t1_ji5aqip,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Barkoook,"Yeah I know about its use and clenbuterol for performance enhancement.. But I think overstimulating sympathetic system will cause anxiety.. Also there are others who are concerned about cardiac Hypertrophy But I think this maybe overestimated

Ive tried it before alone and with coffee (encouraged by a study protocol) and I think in coffee interestingly masked that anxiogenic effect most likely due to increased dopaminergic activity from adenosine antagonism",1682769826,ji6adl7,t3_1318qlm,t1_ji63za3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

harry_lawson,"I think the cardiac issues are only a concern to those also on TRT or with other LVH promoting conditions. I haven't tried clen because it seems to have higher cardiotoxicity.

I think it works best with caffeine, though the stim jitters from that combo is quite bad for me. Rapid heart rate, shaking, anxiety, etc make it mildly uncomfortable, which is why I cycle the stuff and only use it to cut when I want to look lean, and also why I throw the L-Theanine in.",1682776474,ji6mdhq,t3_1318qlm,t1_ji6adl7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
