BigWhat55535,"I have noticed things from it, but definitely not life changing. Been using 20-40mg orally for about a month:

 - Acutely, an odd sense of feeling 'less bad' but specifically in the body. As if the 'emotional body load' is lightened very slightly. It isn't life changing, but it has been pretty reliable. I'll take Nebo, and around 40-1hr later, I'll think the same thing every time, ""Woah, why do I suddenly feel slightly better?"" And then I'll remember I took some Nebo.

 - 20mg insufflated gives a higher heart rate and physical anxiety. I do not and have never had an anxiety disorder. This is not a cognitive occurrence, purely physical. No accompanied hypochondriac thoughts. It's purely a feeling of tightness in the chest.

 - Stronger sensory experience / vividity. First time I took it, I went on a walk and thought, ""Was there always this much going on?"" I heard more sound, and my visual perception felt fuller. Just seemed like everything was a bit busier. I also felt more present/there. Also had a feeling of gliding along/having a smoother, more pleasant walk. That happens consistently when taking it, but it's not a major effect.

 - Apathetic productiveness. Odd, this one. I get in a state where nothing is particularly enjoyable, but I feel the need to do something. Anything that would normally be pleasurable seems unappealing. Anything productive, while not very appealing either, I'm prompted to do by a background feeling of, ""I have to do something.""

That state doesn't seem conducive to happiness. But it does lend itself to making 'better choices'. I did work, writing, cleaning, all a bit more than I usually would. That's appreciated, because it's a rare effect that few substances have given me, not even amphetamines.

That's about it though. I haven't noticed anything definitive beyond that. I tried taking it at night. Didn't interrupt my sleep, but also seemed to give fewer benefits.

----------------------

Also, just because I've left long-written comments like this before, and they inevitably end with many messages months later about the experience, so I'll clarify here: 

This effect was minor. If you're reading this imagining some drastic change in experience, involving psychedelic-like visual acuity, iron-clad productivity, and cure-all depression relief... Don't.

It's subtle. Really subtle. Like, I've had sips of chamomile tea with more noticeable effects. Of course, I take nootropics specifically because they work in the background. As a life-long Adderall user, I've found that psychoactive highs every day mess with my emotional state too much, so I like to find alternatives.

----------------------

I enjoyed TAK-653 a bit more, I'd say. Mostly because I highly value introspection, and it had more of that. Neboglamine wasn't bad, but the magnitude of effect simply hasn't been enough to justify another purchase.

Not to invalidate anyone else's experiences. Plenty on the discord have gotten much more from it. And especially for Sirsad who discredits anecdotes, emphasizes scientific support, and values cognitive enhancing substances, he naturally will tell you very different things about neboglamine.

Personally, NSI-189 remains my favorite nootropic by far. Makes life feel a bit more like a Ghibli film. Brings back child-like imagination. Helps me feel emotions more, which makes for a more vivid life.

Cerebrolysin/Cortexin is also nice. Cortexin especially gives me a brighter mood (like a +1/10).",1682774509,ji6ifze,t3_132m6mb,t3_132m6mb,18,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Well I was being a bit of a degenerate due to a panic of needing to get something done ASAP, meaning I hadn't slept for 48 hours and was on amphetamine. Then suddenly my order came in the mail and after doing a ton of research on nebo decided to give it a shot.

About two or three hours later I noticed I was feeling much much better, took away most of my hangover from not sleeping, restored a clear mind (relatively) and gave me incredible focus. Then subsequently I didn't sleep for another 2 nights and I just had energy everyday like I had a good nights rest. Ofcourse amps will give one energy, but normally with such sleep deprivation, I can't just take enough amphetamine and then feel balanced out like I did.
It was a very natural calm focus.

Since that time kept taking it and it's a lot harder to notice, so I think it's effects are very dependent on situation and what, if any, disorders one might have. Also consider a compound can greatly improve cognition without one considerably feeling different. I think with compounds like nebo and tak, it really becomes noticable in specific situations.

Why not try to do some cognitive test online / speed typing, while on nebo for a few days and while not. Maybe you'll find it actually has an impact or even that you do suddenly notice it now that you do a  cognitive maximally demanding task.

Ofcourse it could be glutamate modulation just doesn't pair well with your brain chemistry and what you would like to experience.

Anyway if you decide it does nothing much, keep some apart and try it if you ever end up sleep deprived with cognitive stuff to do, it might suddenly surprise you!",1682947743,jifg5r7,t3_132m6mb,t3_132m6mb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Yeah this was by no means a combination that was ""responsible"" or I'm proud of, in terms of no idea if I was manifesting excitotoxicity and increased it through nebo. Desperate times, desperate measures.   


Serendipitously I just ordered some memantine yesterday. Also planning on switching over from amphetamine to 4F-MethylPhenidate (can't afford it to use regular MPH with it's shorter duration and high price without a prescription). AFAIK MPH is much safer as it's not a releasing agent, and thus even reduces excitotoxicity when combined with amphetamine vs. same-dose amphetamine alone (in animal trials).  
Then hoping to either taper down with the 4F-MPH or switch to sth like modafinil as a last step before quitting.  
I do consistently dose with Mg-Gly or Mg-Thr, along with a bunch of anti-oxidants like ALA, CoQ10 / PQQ, Melatonin, VitE, VitC (at night, mainly to decrease half-life before/during sleep). Hope that at least softened these past 2 years of sudden daily use (mainly IN aswell...).  


I just wonder what happens to AMPAkinergic activity with e.g. memantine? Seeing as NMDA-antagonism causes an increase in AMPA-signalling through GABAergic inter-neurons; this being believed to be the MoA responsible for the anti-depressant effects of ketamine (as this stimulates mTOR downstream, just like TAK-653). Ever since learning this I'm now confused as by inhibiting the one glutamate receptor, you're now stimulating the other, so is the net effect still neuro-protection? Is NMDAr usually more prone to cause excito-toxicity than AMPAr for example?  


Anyway, if you recommend any other compounds to reign in any potential negative effects or make the transition to abstinence more easy, I'm always keen to hear about those!",1693884057,jz6p4p0,t3_132m6mb,t1_jz1y5p6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Ill_Possible_7740,"If I recall correctly  Cerebrolysin and Cortexin were relatively expensive and injectables? That is what kept me from those in particular.

I do know a lot of people who take memantine say that it prevents tolerance and even repotentiate amphetamine based drugs for some so it must be neuroprotective in the net affect.  Memantine is less likely to affect the AMPA signaling through NMDA inhibition. Memantine doesn't block regular function of the NMDA receptor so it can work like normal. It only blocks when overexcited.  Even then it can still get kicked out if the voltage potential is too strong for the channel. Which is what nitromemantine is supposed to fix if it ever comes out.   
I've seen it said that CNS stims, especially amphetamine, over excites the NMDA receptor. But I did see something about AMPA receptors working differently and preventing overexcitement unlike the NMDA receptor.   
Overexcitement of the NMDA receptor resulting in an influx of ca+ and other ions leading to oxidative stress is well established. As is the excess release of glutamate that triggers the apoptotic cell death cycle for cells with extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. But AMPAr doesn't seem to behave the same way when triggered and doesn't tend to get overexcited.  

In fact, I read that amphetamine causes sensitization of AMPAr which may help with neuroplasticity.  When AMPA receptors get triggered they depolarize the NMDA receptors to make them work. So by suppressing the NMDA receptor, assuming what you say is accurate, then I think it is just increasing the AMPA receptor signaling in order to more easily trigger the NMDA receptor. It sounds like a feedback loop.   


Some things that may be neuroprotective if you aren't already taking them.

N-Acetyl- Cystein (NAC) - promotes glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is your bodies primary antioxidant and in almost every cell. Has a ton of other functions.

Acetyl-L-Carnitine - (ALCAR) protects mitochondria and makes energy use more efficient. Personally found it helps me concentrate longer even when I start to get sleepy. Like an extra couple hours more.

Vitamin B-complex - promotes energy use in the body and used in many functions in the brain. If not available for a reaction you body can produce bad things like homocysteine. 

Omega 3s are good especially high in DHA which is used in the brain for cellular structure. When I would forget to take my fish oil I noticed the next day my ADHD meds were less effective. 

Uridine is purported to upregulate the dopamine pathway.

Alpha GPC or CDP Choline- Increases choline in the body which is used in cell structure. Also increases acetylcholine which is an important neurotransmitter.  ake one or the other but not both. Too much choline can make you sleepy. 

Taking your magnesium supplements is good. But best if you can determine what ratio of calcium to magnesium you are taking. The ratio is also important and can be looked up easily online. I forget what it is off hand. something like 1.7 to 2.3 with 2.1 being optimal. But don't quote me on that LOL.

Vinpocetine - has a laundry list of neuroprotective effects. It's actually a prescription drug in other countries but here it is just a supplement. Life Extensions has it pretty cheap. 

Beta-alanine- increases carnosine in the body which is neuroprotective in a bunch of ways. 

beta anhydrous Trimethylglycine (TMG) - Is a methyl donor but unlike other methyl donors, it doesn't get oxidized after donation. Also promotes increased methionine and other neuroprotective functions.

curcumin - decreases inflammation and purported to have some other neuroprotective properties.

krill oil high in phospholipids - phospholipids are used in many parts of cell constructions. Also has some EPA and DHA in the phospholipid form which is the most bioavailable form. 

Spermidine - neuroprotective by reducing oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Mimics the effects of fasting by inducing cellular renewal through autophagy. Bunch of other purported effects. 

Taurine - used in the body for many things. Body not that great at making it and declines with age. Neuroprotective in a few ways and other functions.
