Anyone else find Neboglamine really disappointing? 

Not sure I feel or notice much at all for all the hype..

Tried a variation of different dosages and methods.

I was hoping for a noticeable mood increase or positive effect on social anxiety but nothing really noticeable.

I want to say it has maybe a slight anti anxiety effect but not a very enjoyable one..

Wondering other users thoughts and if they may also be somewhat disappointed?

Does this compound have to build up in the system perhaps?

I also found TAK quite disappointing as well to be honest.

Nothing really seems to come on par with Bromantane or even NSI-189 in terms of effectiveness or noticeable effect in my opinion.

What method did users have most success with in terms of Neboglamine?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Anyone else find Neboglamine really disappointing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/132m6mb/anyone_else_find_neboglamine_really_disappointing/
