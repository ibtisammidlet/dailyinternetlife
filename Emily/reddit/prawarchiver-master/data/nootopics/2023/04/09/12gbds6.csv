PabloAnnie,"I would take the tyrosine on an empty stomach (2 - 3h after a meal) at the time where you usually feel your vyvanse wearing off, and at least 30 minutes, but ideally 60, before your next meal. It really gives an acute boost you can feel.

Splitting the dose is a no-brainer and probably the most effective solution for your problem. You'll have to find out what is the best time, so that you prolong it as much as possible without negatively affecting sleep.Taking 2g vitamin C is a good trick to prevent insomnia, as it will acidify your urine, which in turn will greatly enhance speed of the elimination of amphetamine. I take that about 2-3h before sleep as your body still needs time to absorb the vit C and eliminate amphetamine from your blood.

Fasoracetam could be an interesting non-stimulant compound for your ADHD. IIRC about 33% of ADHD patients have a mutation in their mGLU-receptors (glutamate) which fasoracetam modulates and thus could correct for this.

You can find Fasoracetam on everychem.com and Sabroxy at Nootropics Depot. They are both very reliable shops that do laboratory tests on their products, so you know you're getting what you ordered.

P.S: Also look into TAK-653! (everychem has it) But beware as it might not be safe to take together with amphetamine, as this might cause excitotoxicity",1681059052,jfl813d,t3_12gbds6,t3_12gbds6,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

martin3747,"Autism is completely different for everyone.
I do think that the majority of my daily challenges are from my ADHD ..

It doesn't fix my autism but it means I'm not constantly torn from being either

Cz they are still quite different 

Eg. I crave novelty at times, however being autistic I only find Calmness in routine and patterns

They overlap and also conflict",1681030924,jfjudvz,t3_12gbds6,t3_12gbds6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Taken in the morning it will probably reduce the jitterines / OCD type effects of vyvanse (or any other stimulant for that matter). You could also take it morning + evening.

I myself take taurine for this as I don't notice much from theanine, they're both really safe supplements to take. I take 1gr 3x daily.  
For more info on taurine vs theanine (and their pharmacodynamics) check out this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/lo5wu8/ltheanine\_vs\_taurine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/lo5wu8/ltheanine_vs_taurine/)",1681057746,jfl4umm,t3_12gbds6,t1_jfl16rq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

martin3747,"Autism and ADHD overlap quite a bit. 

Vyvanse won't treat the autism. But definitely helps with any ADD symptoms. I get to enjoy my interests without constant racing thoughts.

In some ways, vyvanse changes my autism however, almost intensifies 

Some people believe autism and adhd are on two different ends of the same spectrum.

Having both makes it easier to find balance in the centre. 

Since treating ADHD, I feel I sit closer to the other end of this spectrum now. ( hope this makes sense)

martin3747,"Sorry I'll give you a few better examples . It does help to a point but I feel that it only helps the adhd 

For me, this makes sense to me. Happy to hear your thoughts?

ADHD primarily involves inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, while autism is characterised by social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive behaviors.


Autism and ADHD have different underlying neurochemical processes. Vyvanse acts on dopamine and norepinephrine, which mainly affect attention and impulsivity. It does not directly address the neurochemical imbalances associated with autism.",1681031653,jfjv7op,t3_12gbds6,t1_jfjtw2k,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
