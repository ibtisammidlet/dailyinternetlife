cgodet,"Bromantane has been known to have the potential to heal damage brought on by stimulant abuse, as well as having mild stimulating and anxiolytic properties on its own. TAK-653 has been shown to work in a similar fashion to Ketamine, which is known for its rapid anti-depressant effects, so yes, both of them have the ability to help you with your emotional and motivation issues. And as always, always trial one compound at a time. Good luck!  - Chris",1681046548,jfkfr81,t3_12gahqy,t3_12gahqy,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,Bromantane increased it for me but TAK increased emotions but in a beneficial way at least for me. I was a bit on the emotionally blunted spectrum so the effectâ€™s were more pronounced for me for both.,1681033709,jfjxi0w,t3_12gahqy,t3_12gahqy,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

TheLimpDickMafia,"is everychem a good source of bromantane? They only sell it as a spray, which is a bit odd. Bout 10mg per spray (I think a normal dose of Bromantane is 50mg?), but it's affordable and might be a good way to test it out (I've read bromantane has no effect on some people) - Science.bio is out of stock on bromantane.

caffeinehell,"NE increases seem to be blunting for me. My body canâ€™t handle adrenaline much. I gotta be careful with it and try to find something that ups DA but not NE too much.

PabloAnnie,It's a nasal spray and through this way it's at least twice as potent! So it's a very decent price this way. Also it starts to work much faster compared to oral :),1681093073,jfncx9g,t3_12gahqy,t1_jfmz8ie,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
