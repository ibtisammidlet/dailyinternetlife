Vialix,"Sirsadalot posted a comprehensive guide in which, according to him, this is one and only way for upregulation currently and everything else is shit. I have researched this concept a bit, and I am posting this in hopes someone will disprove it. Basically, I am looking for reasons why possibly this stack would fail, what is its weak point, so that it can get my brain going to improve it.  


Start with Bromantane sublingual at a dosage of 100mg per day, taken in the morning.  
Add 3g of L-Tyrosine to the stack, also taken in the morning.  
Take 1-2 cups of coffee with the Bromantane and L-Tyrosine.  
Take Sulbutiamine during the day at a dosage of 400-600mg.  
Take Uridine monophosphate at night at a dosage of 700mg.  
Add Agmatine Sulfate at a dosage of 1g to sensitize to dopamine and protect from Bromantane amyloid buildup.  
Add Ginko Biloba 50-1 extract at a dosage of 120mg to take away from the GABAergic effects of Bromantane and Agmatine, and to add to dopamine and memory ability.  
Use the full stack for a month before assessing its effectiveness.  


  
Bromantane (100mg sublingual in the morning):  
Bromantane is an atypical psychostimulant and anxiolytic that enhances dopamine synthesis and increases expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, leading to increased dopamine levels (Lapin, 1999). This can improve motivation, focus, and mood.  
Source: Lapin, I. (1999). Bromantane, a new original psychostimulant and anxiolytic drug. Eksp Klin Farmakol, 62(5), 32-34.  
L-Tyrosine (3g in the morning):  
L-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and can help replenish neurotransmitter levels. Combining L-Tyrosine with Bromantane may enhance dopamine synthesis and boost cognitive function (Fernstrom & Fernstrom, 2007).

Caffeine (1-2 cups of coffee):  
Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that can enhance alertness and cognitive function by blocking adenosine receptors and increasing neurotransmitter release, including dopamine (Nehlig, 2010).  
Source: Nehlig, A. (2010). Is caffeine a cognitive enhancer? Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 20(S1), 85-94.  
Sulbutiamine (400-600mg during the day):  
Sulbutiamine is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1) that increases thiamine levels in the brain. It can enhance memory, attention, and mood by modulating cholinergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems (Tiev et al., 1999).

Uridine monophosphate (700mg at night):  
Uridine is a nucleotide that can enhance memory and cognition by increasing synaptic plasticity and promoting the synthesis of brain phosphatidylcholine (Wurtman et al., 2000).  
Source: Wurtman, R. J., Cansev, M., & Sakamoto, T. (2000). Use of phosphatide precursors to promote synaptogenesis. Annual Review of Nutrition, 20(1), 59-73.  


Agmatine sulfate (1g):  
Agmatine has neuroprotective properties and can enhance dopamine receptor sensitivity, further potentiating the dopaminergic effects of other components in the stack (Gilad & Gilad, 2016).

Ginkgo Biloba 50-1 extract (120mg):  
Ginkgo Biloba is a well-known herbal supplement that can improve cognitive function and memory by increasing cerebral blood flow and exerting antioxidant effects. Additionally, it has been shown to have positive effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, which may synergize with other components in the stack (Ahlemeyer & Krieglstein, 2003; Rigney et al., 1999).

neuro__atypical,"Receptor upregulation and downregulation in the CNS is regulated at least partially (if not mostly) through NMDA. This is why NMDA antagonists can slow or even reverse drug tolerance.

wookmaster69,There’s legit published studies that link tyrosine supplementation to an increased risk of melanomas in people who already have a genetic predisposition to them. I see people push tyrosine so much and there’s not a whole lot of evidence that it does much of anything in general. Let alone scaring the shit out of a pale ass mfr.

XQCW_VIVON420,"There is no proof that L-Tyrosine upregulates dopamine, it only increases it, so it only seems to make sense in people where there is a gene defect causing dopamine deficiency. Also same with Uridine, it does not upregulate, same with caffeine.  


Also 100mg bromantane is too much, and SubL is not the best ROA, Intranasal is, at approx 27mg best dose.",1682641598,jhzp7vu,t3_1313uog,t1_jhyqrha,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

He now recommends D-Serine + Ceylon Cinnamon + PQQ to enhance NMDA activity

found info nalt is also obsolete

it seems the only constant in the stacks is bromantine (intranasal at x1 dose or sublingual x2 dose with oil) and alcar is always recommended (starting high oe around 1000mg, then 500mg)

It feels like bromantine + alcar + nac are something that has had good rep over the years, while the other stuff is not so much clear",1682636078,jhzd6ag,t3_1313uog,t1_jhz5xq8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"It's GABAergic for one, which isn't really desirable if you're trying to upregulate dopamine (inconsistent with the overall goal).

The main issue is that ""Mr. Happy Stack"" (fish oil/DHA, citicoline/Alpha-GPC, uridine monophosphate) has been disproven as a method of upregulating dopamine.

That said, there are other potential benefits to that stack that you may find. If there are any other major issues, I'm not aware of them (doesn't mean there aren't).",1682724017,ji49en1,t3_1313uog,t1_ji1otgt,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
