Do any of the neurotrophic factors help in the process of up-regulation of receptors in the pineal gland. Pharmacologically speaking, too much of an agonist or hormone will down-regulate receptors, limiting function. The inverse is a process over time as they are gradually recycled to the surface of the cell again. I’m editing this because i want to know if any neurotrophic factors can regulate melatonin receptors.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Neurotrophic factors,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1313uog/neurotrophic_factors/

For more than 5 years now and I‘ve tried almost everything out there regarding therapy (3 times without success), prescribed medication, antidepressants, valium, lyrica, kratom. Life is still a total mess, painful and unbearable. Nothing helped.

I just found that I have Bacopa, SAM-e and Mulungu at home. Anyone experiences with one of these regarding mood, relaxation, mental changes or especially improved sociability and reduced social anxiety? 

Any other OTC, supplement, or whatever, that you want to recommend because you think, read or experienced it‘s very helpful for social anxiety (and depression) issues?

I‘m very grateful for any help. For real!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Best for Social Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/130tjxe/best_for_social_anxiety/

The guy who was eating breakfast with his children. This brings the question, has anyone else had a short-term existential crisis due to TAK 653?

I’ve been observing my bodily movements passively since starting TAK. I also have the sensation that I am listening to my thoughts and can respond to them if that makes sense. I’ve now kind of snapped myself out of an hour long discussion within myself debating if free will really exists. In past use of TAK I have thought about the multiverse theory, and the extensive possibilities of my life choices. 

Reading this back makes me sound like a pseudo- intellectual stoner. But my experience on TAK has been quite distracting yet I see and experience the benefits. 

Has anyone else had thoughts bias towards contemplating existence on TAK-653?
