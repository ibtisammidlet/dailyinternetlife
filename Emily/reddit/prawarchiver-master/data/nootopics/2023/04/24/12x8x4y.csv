Vialix,"It works like this: cognitive enhancement -> higher self-awareness -> existential contemplation.

  
AMPA receptor function and cognitive enhancement: Lynch (2004) showed that AMPA receptor PAMs, such as TAK-653, can improve cognitive functions like learning and memory by enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP), a key cellular mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity.   
  
Cognitive enhancement and self-awareness: Grant et al. (2010) found that cognitive enhancement can lead to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences. In their study, individuals who underwent cognitive training exhibited greater self-awareness and understanding of their cognitive processes.   
  
Self-awareness and existential contemplation: Silvia & Philips (2013) discovered that higher self-awareness can lead to existential contemplation. They found that individuals with higher self-awareness were more likely to engage in existential thinking and philosophical inquiry.  
  
TAK-653, as an AMPA receptor PAM, enhances cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, leading to increased self-awareness. This heightened self-awareness, in turn, may promote existential contemplation and introspective experiences.",1682627325,jhys7bs,t3_12x8x4y,t3_12x8x4y,10,False,t5_4aoxhu

When I took TAK-653 I did notice greater introspection and a deeper penetration of insight into the causation of certain behaviors, emotions, mindsets and other phenomenon pertaining to personality.

I can't say I experienced an undeniable increase in existential, metaphysical, or philosophical thinking. But to be honest, those kinds of thoughts are always swirling around in my head anyways.

AMPA receptors are a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. By potentiating AMPA receptor function, TAK-653 can increase synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Monyer et al., 1991).

Vialix,"I don't care much about introspection for nootropics, because if I wanted introspection etc. I'd simply use shrooms or lsd. There is no reason to look for introspection in anything else, really. But let's check anyway. First, dry research to build our hypotheses on:

Winblad (2005) found that piracetam improved cognitive function in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment, maybe (?) leading to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences.

Aniracetam improved memory and cognition (Nakamura & Kurasawa, 2001; Martin et al., 1993), which may (?) contribute to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences.

Oxiracetam enhanced memory consolidation in rats (Mondadori et al., 1993) and improved cognitive performance in patients with mild to moderate dementia (Passeri et al., 1996), potentially leading to heightened self-awareness and introspective experiences.

Now, let's look for novel connections between studies:

Emotional processing: Aniracetam has been shown to enhance emotional processing in animal models (Nishizaki et al., 1998). Enhanced emotional processing could lead to a deeper understanding of one's emotions, further promoting introspection. This is supported by the findings of Silvia & Philips (2013) that higher self-awareness can lead to existential contemplation.

Creativity and problem-solving: Research on AMPA receptor modulation and cognition has found connections to enhanced creativity and problem-solving skills. For example, a study by Canals et al. (2009) showed that aniracetam improved problem-solving performance in rats. Increased creativity and problem-solving abilities could lead to more profound introspective experiences by expanding the scope of one's cognitive explorations.

Cholinergic transmission: Racetams, such as aniracetam, have been found to modulate cholinergic transmission in the brain (Shimizu et al., 1995). Cholinergic transmission is essential for cognitive function, including attention and memory. By enhancing cholinergic transmission, racetams may indirectly facilitate introspection through improved cognitive abilities.

That wouldn't be very productive, but the state you're describing actually sounds pretty cool if it's not going too far.",1682920698,jiefiz6,t3_12x8x4y,t1_jieegw5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Thank You for the detailed reply.  And yeah I‚Äôd agree psychedelics (and weed IME) are much better for introspection.

But considering most people have an utter lack of self awareness, and often no desire to gain it (even if they claim to want it,) would cognitive enhancement really help them?  Or would they just use their enhanced cognition to further support their own delusions?

IQ and Realism can be completely distinct.  Many high IQ people can construct complex ideas of self, and even whole ideologies about society, that appear to make sense, but when checked against reality the whole idea came from a desire to validate an emotion or ego.  Self awareness can be quite painful, and most people prefer to avoid pain and feel good.

Now the type of people who seek nootropics tend to be those  who already have above average intelligence (which is a bit of a paradox because you could argue that they need them less.)  And I would imagine they are also more self aware, although I have no proof of this. 

So amongst the types who seek nootropics I would say it would enhance their self awareness.  But if you gave nootropics to someone with either a low IQ and/or low self awareness I personally doubt it would have much impact on them.  At best, an intelligent but emotional person would just use their increased cognition to rationalize their unpleasant emotions into pleasant ones.  However, A low IQ person perhaps would gain some self awareness if they truly desired it (but in general they don‚Äôt; low IQ people just prefer entertainment and drama.)

I do like your theory about higher self awareness leading to existential contemplation.  I‚Äôve definitely noticed this with in myself the more self aware I become.  It‚Äôs quite painful, so it‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse.  It may have played a big role in my prior addictions.  But I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

Vialix,"Assuming that it is intelligent people who seek nootropics may be true, but it is actually a dangerous thought at the same time. I would rather avoid this way of thinking, as it could lead to nootropics-interested people to develop elitist culture, or an individual start thinking highly of himself in sort of a mania, and it could end badly, considering it is just so pleasant and it lies in human nature to consider ourselves more intelligent that others for whatever reasons.... it happens even without certain substances, and with accepts to nootropics/ adhd medications, it increases the risk 2x.

If you are interested in existential contemplation, or higher self-awareness, I seriously encourage to simply go for a one-time psychedelic trip, then integrate it, and then come back to the ""standard programming"", the usual course of the day with groceries and boring, usual potatoe peeling.

&#x200B;

Seriously: one-time 8-hour trip will open more mental doors and show more repressed insights that 10 years of nootropics could ever offer. I have never been more certain of anything: go for a one-time trip **per year** for the purpose of self-reflections according to eg. Terrence Mckeena instructions, then integrate it for 1-2 weeks without taking any nootropics,  and then simply go back to nootropics if you need, but this time, **nothing related to self-rumination**. Simply go for cognition or focus or whatever, but do not seek existential analysis: everything that could help you in that, is already contained in form of shrooms/lsd/maybe thc. That's it. And never go for self-rumination for longer than a 8-hour trip + a week of integratrion. It's just no point, and could take you way off the ground.

&#x200B;

To sum up:

if interested in self-rumination, looking into your psyche, existential fears, self-care: go for one-time psychedelic trip\* works well every time 100%

if interested in focus, cognition, intelligence: go for nootropics, and it will take a while to find something that works, if you will be able to find it at all

I tend to be a low responder to psychedelics, but I‚Äôm not sure why.  The products I got were usually great; everyone was tripping out on much lower doses.  I get a nice lift from them, some good visuals, but unfortunately I‚Äôve never had any profound introspection on them.  

I‚Äôve done 5 tabs of acid a few times with only a light trip, and did a 5.5 gram mushroom trip recently (in the dark alone with piano music) and it was nothing at all like the divine ineffable experience most people get.    This has been this way my whole life.

I‚Äôd really like to break through or have a profound psychedelic experience.

Now, THC I‚Äôm the opposite.  Even just a tiny toke, even of an alt like d8, gets me so deep in my own head.  Unfortunately I can‚Äôt do it often as I can‚Äôt function on a THC high, and I‚Äôm prone to anxiety on it.

There's some subtle things I've noticed but the main thing is that it makes me a better speaker. I can articulate my thoughts a lot more clearly when I'm talking. By default my thoughts are extremely fast and I generally talk fast to keep up. I have to actively try to slow down my speaking pace, especially so when I'm nervous. Aniracetam kind of helps slow me down allowing me to have more time to focus on what words to say next, so I end up coming off way more eloquent and calm.
