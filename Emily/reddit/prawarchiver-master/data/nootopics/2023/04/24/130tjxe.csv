lord_weasel,"Bacopa made me tired. SAM-e made me feel really strange, quiet, and not social at all (irritable). Never tried Mulungu. Bromantane has been nice for socializing, but mainly anything that can induce mania type states of mind will do that. So far neboglamine has been interesting but not mind blowing. Morphodrol is an amazing one to use on occasion, it makes me really chatty. Kratom + PPAP is a fantastic combo to just enjoy what’s happening around you. Personally, if my routine is boring or messed up, I tend to be less social until I’m back in the groove. Nothing I’ve used makes me want to be social if I already don’t want to be. If I’m going to be social, said substances make socializing smoother. Getting your mental, emotional, goals, and motivations closer to a healthy state in your alone time will be the best way to increase socializing IMO. Self image is a big part of this, and no substance will make you feel better about yourself. In my experience, the more value you see in yourself, the less social anxiety will be present (confidence comes naturally when you know your value). I don’t know if you have a routine, but starting one will help to an incredible degree. Do things that make you feel excited, or things you’re good at and keep doing it. Noots and drugs will only amplify or mask your current condition, especially if you’re unwilling to change.",1682614068,jhxu1u1,t3_130tjxe,t3_130tjxe,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

It does all this very effectively, much more so than say caffeine, without causing jitters, adrenaline, or anxiety, it's like it almost works in the background. This would not directly obliterate your anxiety but I have found it allows one to think clearer under the duress anxiety, and also eliminates the fatigue that uncomfortable social situations can bring. It can also make socializing more rewarding and immersive. I feel this combined with another more conventional source of anti-anxiety treatment/meds could be promising.

Not sure if you’ve tried them before but you didn’t mention that you did.

I understand if you don’t wanna go that route as I don’t want to either but I’ve promised myself I would if nothing else works. You may need like a light dose of Wellbutrin or Prozac. And it wouldn’t have to be forever…just as long as you need til you feel you’ve recovered some balance and stability in your life.

Timely-Huckleberry73,"I spent years (starting as a teenager) thinking that there was something wrong with my brain and that I had a “mental illness” that was causing my depression and anxiety. In hindsight I realize I was essentially brainwashed by a cult. I see psychiatry as a cult who preys upon people who are struggling (and there are so many reasons why a person may be struggling) convinces them that the reason they are struggling is that they have a “chemical imbalance” in their brain (despite their being absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support this claim). Then gives them powerful mind altering drugs with very limited evidence of efficacy in the long term, and then those drugs disrupt their normal brain functioning and cause an *actual* chemical imbalance in their brain. They then continue to get worse (or at least not get better) due to the incredibly harmful drugs they are taking and their symptoms are blamed on their “mental illness”. 

I believed in this narrative for many years. I tried med after med after med just looking for the drug that “worked for me”. Nothing worked, most gave me nothing but side effects and some gave me mild short term relief and just made things worse in the long run. It wasn’t until I realized drugs were not the answer and that I had everything I needed inside myself to heal that I was finally able to overcome both the depression and anxiety. 

How is someone supposed to get better when they believe they are fundamentally broken at a biologically level? This belief is almost as destructive as the drugs themselves. I would do anything to get back the years I spent popping pills and feeling that I was a hopeless person with a disease of a brain. I believed this narrative 100%, and yet in hindsight I realize it was 100% wrong.

I admit I took doses well above the recommended range, until I felt heavily sedated as that was the only way I could force myself to sleep. For me phenibut at high doses, say past 2.5g, had a strong alcohol like body high, although with a much clearer headspace. With benzos I just felt more tired and calm the higher the dose it took. Everyone reacts to drugs differently, and I probably react more to phenibut and less to benzos than the average person.

MrMeseekssss,"I had a class in college where we had to give a speech on a new topic every week for 6 months. At the end of those 6 months do you know what I was not less afraid of?  Giving speeches.

I have seen the shockingly few studies on exposure and a couple things are clear.  Most say that CBT and medication had better result albeit with exposure therapy approaching statistical significance for positive improvement on social phobia. However they also gauged this by questions given to the participants after the end of that exposure.  

You know how relieved you feel once you are out of a social situation with phobia.  A lot!  Immediately after I think that wasn't as bad as I thought.  That's the thing about social phobia.  It's never as bad as you thought but the issue is you think it will be.

If they wanted to do a legitimate study they would question the subjects immediately prior to these exposures and follow up with how they are doing post study which most didn't.

So exposure therapy only helps while you are in the moment. After the fact you are reset to afraid of the next event.  

Also nobody I have known has ever gotten less afraid of heights with exposure and we faced a lot of that sh*t in the military.",1682819356,ji97xhb,t3_130tjxe,t1_ji93vco,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

lord_weasel,"By itself it’s pretty mild. Some stimulation and some flutters in your chest. It’s definitely more stimulating at +30mg. There’s two scenarios it really shines:

1: combination with a stimulant

2: use near the time you’d have a response to something. For example:

* working out (post cardio has a much more rewarding buzz)
* music (especially new songs)
* activities that you get a real kick out of (for me, going hiking already elicits a strong response and PPAP can make it more profound)

You can build a tolerance to it so it’s best used sparingly. Higher doses can cause some anxious tones, for me higher than 50mg starts feeling too wirey but it’s also too expensive of a substance to use high doses of anyway. It works within 30ish minutes generally.",1683130604,jippccl,t3_130tjxe,t1_jioe39n,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Timely-Huckleberry73,"There is not a single intervention for any mental health problem in the entire field of psychology that is more supported by evidence than exposure. Pretty much the only thing we can know with certainty when it comes to psychology is that exposure works. And yes, CBT is the most evidence based approach for treating social anxiety, and the behavioural part of CBT is exposure. CBT for social anxiety is exposure therapy (with a cognitive therapy component as well, but exposure is the most important part).

If you had given a speech in your class every single day for six months you would probably be less afraid of giving speeches, if you had given one every week for six years you would also probably be less afraid. The fact that you say it was never as bad as you thought is exposure therapy in action. Every time you expose yourself to something frightening and realize it is not as bad as you thought in chips away at your unhelpful/irrational beliefs. With repeated exposures eventually it sinks in and you actually start seeing the frightening stimulus as less frightening. This is virtually a law of human psychology.

In order for exposure therapy to be effective you have to do it correctly though. If you end an exposure before you have calmed down it will not work. Also if you use secondary avoidance strategies (such as using a drug to reduce anxiety) it will not work. And if you do not do the exposure frequently enough and with enough volume it will not work. Anecdotal accounts of people saying they faced their fears and yet remain afraid does not in anyway mean that exposure therapy does not work. Among those who practice evidence based psychology it is not even a matter of debate.",1682820762,ji9aqw6,t3_130tjxe,t1_ji97xhb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

There are other options out there and something will work, but it won't happen overnight. A drug or nootropic may not even be the answer. Keep an open mind, it may take hard work and some self-reflection to eventually find relief.

For starters, I'd highly recommend looking into a good psychiatrist, as well as a therapist/psychologist, if those are options (if you only choose one, go with the psychiatrist, as they're able to prescribe medication if appropriate).",1682909804,jidyly1,t3_130tjxe,t1_jidvukv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Timely-Huckleberry73,"Yes usually it is prudent to use incremental exposure. To tell a person with a fear of heights to jump out of a plane is called “flooding” which is the most extreme version of exposure. Flooding can be very effective and can allow a person to bypass the entire exposure hierarchy however it comes with risks and is rarely used by clinicians. First of all it is simply extremely unpleasant for the client. But the main risk is that you would send the clients anxiety skyrocketing and they would then likely not carry through with repeated exposures which would just traumatize them and make the problem worse. It is very important for a client to calm down before ending exposures as they need to learn than it is not as bad as they thought (or at least that they can handle it) and not the other way around lol.

The reason I used the plane example is that you had brought it up first. I don’t think many (if any) therapists would recommend such an extreme exposure but if the client was to do it enough times it would most likely actually work.",1682821994,ji9d6e7,t3_130tjxe,t1_ji9c7j7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Making the decision to see a psychiatrist was the first step. My pdoc aided me in properly diagnosing my panic disorder and prescribed appropriate medication (which I still take to this day). I had never really been taught the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists, so it took me a while to figure out what I needed.

It was also psychiatrists who treated me (several doctors over many years due to relapses mostly) for opioid addiction and dependence with Suboxone, which eventually stuck. I'm not sure if they've loosened it up, but only certain psychiatrists are/were permitted to prescribe Suboxone (it's specifically for opioid addiction).

Ultimately, the reason I was successful was because I genuinely wanted to get--and stay--opioid free. I made a conscious choice that I didn't want to use opioids if possible ever again, and especially not for recreational value.

I have more to say, but I wanted to give you something. The key to being free from addiction of anything is a true desire and willingness to stop using that substance, and hopefully, to not abuse any substances in the future.

Doctors and nootropics may be able to aid with the physical symptoms and dependence (and I'd recommend utilizing these tools if needed). **However,** at the end of the day, if you still want to get that high (even a little bit), nothing is going to stick.

Edit: also, if there are individuals in your life who encourage you to continue abusing substances, or whose presence either encourages use or is typically associated with using (i.e., people who you get high with), you'll need to remove yourself from their social circles and cut off contact (unless they also get clean).

MrNeverEverKnew,"Thanks so true, what you said:

>If you still want to get that high (even a little bit), nothing is going to stick.

100%. You will always think back how easy you can get these good feelings and/or relief by just popping something. You have to really learn that and how it's not the solution, a bad decision and making everything worse after time.

For me, it's about reducing depression and social anxiety symptoms, while also curing my cognitive deficits (ADD like) so I really always hop back to using anything cause I don't know how to get better with these, I suffered through these symptoms until I was 17 completely sober. Then came the time when I said, I tried so much and it probably won't improve ever, fuck it, I suffer so much and there's no perspective improving, I will make my life as functional and enjoyable as possible and just take what I need. Now I'm using for 5 years already - first alcohol, got off of it, then phenibut, got off of it, then kratom and now kratom and lyrica.",1683197023,jitbstg,t3_130tjxe,t1_jisinbx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"Your struggle sounds quite similar to mine, tbh. You deserve a lot of credit for making it to 17 sober with what you were likely dealing with (I didn't). PD (panic disorder) was only part of the equation for me.

The symptoms began manifesting around the same time I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), at which point I was only 15. Opioids were the easiest thing to acquire (and hide), so I started self-medicating. I also started using cannabis regularly to help deal with IBS symptoms.

For a while, the weed was enough. Taking easier courses and doing what I could to lower my stress definitely helped, though it didn't come without cost (dropped all honors and more challenging courses).

Are you getting Lyrica from a doctor? It sounds like you just want something to help so you don't feel so badly all the time (rather than a particular interest in getting high off of 'x'). I'd strongly recommend finding a psychiatrist and getting properly diagnosed if you have not already. This sounds more like a psychiatric issue than pure substance abuse.

I would also (after addressing the meds/drugs) look into a psychologist/therapist that specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) if you have insurance that covers it.
