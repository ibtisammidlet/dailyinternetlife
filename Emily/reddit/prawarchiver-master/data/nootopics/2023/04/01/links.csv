What I notice.. big boost in beginning of day, and random parts of the day
-I feel somewhat stoked about getting out and crossing off the list of errands. 
-A nap mid day feels needed here and there,Then another spurt. 
-Emotions by end of day, depending on how busy, I feel like going to bed and not dealing with anyone. 

-Dreams are definitely wild. Took a notch up in theme/settings. I love this part. 
-I also do not feel like eating after a 2-4mg dose in the morning (still trying to find sweet spot)
It’ll stave me off till a late lunch regardless. 

I usually have adderall twice a week for the long days of typing content/shop hours. (1/3 of an XRS or 1/2 of a 30mg amp/dex. Yes pharma. 

I stopped TAK for yesterday and today, was out of town. Felt like I’m still feeling the effects. 
Is it safe to have both at the same day? 
I’m aware of AMPA PAM’s but not all interactions. Must just ask the general question. 

If they were ok, I would most likely significantly lower my doses on the adderall. Since TAK gives me odd energy spurts.
