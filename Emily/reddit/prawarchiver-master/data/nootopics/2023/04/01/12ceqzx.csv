EchoingSimplicity,I took TAK-653 2mg with Vyvanse 20mg every day for a month and did not experience any adverse effects.,1680723973,jf3dqhw,t3_12ceqzx,t3_12ceqzx,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
TigerEye408,"Thank you everyone for your time and input. 

Today I took 30mg of Neboglamine, and 2mg of TAK later in the day since I already have TAK build up. I feel like a Guinea Pig. But I took Nebo when I first woke up and a bit groggy. (First Time) I felt quite nice and fell back asleep.
Woke up 4 hrs later (my free day). Decided to stack TAK. 
Again. Hunger suppressed. May do light workout, go run with the dog. Who needs the exercise or you can feel his anxiousness emit! 
Then do the tasks for my business. 

Again. Appreciate the time. 
I was curious about this because these are both stimulating, but don’t know the exact pharmacology, if mixing the two. 

Either way, I’ll try myself. And definitely report

I know for sure.
TAK + Bromantane work incredible. Add a little Semax/selank (NA/Regular) later in the day. And that feels like a nice. 
Works best when you don’t work from home. And you’re either on job site, errands, home situation. 
Moving around. Makes it more stimulating personally instead of being strapped to the workbench at home. 

Try to tread carefully here. 

I have NSI-189, curious to how I will personally respond. But won’t be for a while because I still have another bottle of TAK And Neboglamine to individually trial. Then stack here and there.",1680756464,jf5dlrg,t3_12ceqzx,t3_12ceqzx,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Spirited_Gap7644,I’ve been taking TAK with my prescription as well and it goes fine but take lower dosages of both. 1mg-2mg of Tak. 15mg IR Addy.

ozonep2,"That's an interesting experience :)

Because I don't get any energy boost from TAK. Unlike with Tropisetron, that actually gives me mild boost for a few hours.

Actually, I don't think I 'feel' anything after taking TAK, but I still take it for potential memory/IQ improvements :) Memory improvement is not something one can easily feel.",1680709357,jf2b0b9,t3_12ceqzx,t3_12ceqzx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Do you know if excitotoxicity is noticable when looking out for specific symptoms or can it be a silent-killer type thing? Is AMPAr usually the culprit or is it more about NMDAr? 
I'm still on daily amps and initially thought I would combine with TAK (so I could probably lower amp dosage + other enhancement) but then later got a bit scared as it's a novel compound. I really want to trial TAK properly though at 1-2mg.

TigerEye408,"That’s exactly what I was thinking with AMPA activation…leading to overstimulation.
Thus reducing my doses in combination. It would be a juggle.

PabloAnnie,"I've been refraining from TAK all this time because I'm still on amphetamine daily and I was afraid this could lead to excitotoxicity. Have only taken a few  1mg doses here and there, no adverse effects felt. I'd love to actually trial it daily.

So you're saying it will probably be ok when dosing both moderately?

Are there any symptoms to look out for when you would get excitotoxicity, or can it be a silent killer type thing (which is what I was/am afraid of)",1681157492,jfqmt5j,t3_12ceqzx,t1_jf1n75x,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TigerEye408,"Interesting. And thank you for your answer. I found that if I don’t take TAK that day, I’m fine. And it depends which adderall type I’m using. I can see 15mg looking good with this.",1680755564,jf5c5mk,t3_12ceqzx,t1_jf30ruu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Tak is something that you would normally take everyday, e.g. for depression and / or cognitive improvement like memory / IQ enhancement. If you're already used to taking amphetamine at times for better motivation or long days, sooner or later you will find yourself with OP's question.

Search reddit for user sirsadalot, who started this subreddit, and there's a guide on AMPA PAMs pinned to his profile, there you'll find more info on TAK653 if you're interested!",1681157936,jfqnxcz,t3_12ceqzx,t1_jf1as11,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"Sorry. I could speculate, but you're never going to get the certainty that you crave. There's no definitive way to tell if you're experiencing excitotoxicity or not. Just that it's usually present in high dosages of recreational drugs such as meth or MDMA. And it can eventually present itself in cognitive and mood issues, as a result of the damage.

Do I think TAK-653 with amphetamine is excitotoxic? No. Not unless you're taking high doses of amphetamines. Do I have anything to prove that to you? No.

If you want to do your own research, maybe you could find something to cling onto and give you a transient sense of hope, but any doctor or responsible neuroscientist is going to tell you not to take this combo. And any noothead will tell you it's fine, and that they've done worse.

Sorry that I can't give you a definitive answer, but I highly recommend *not* looking for certainty when there isn't. As in, unless it's explicitly demonstrated in the literature, don't kid yourself in thinking that for X reason or Y study you're for sure in the clear.

If you'd like to do your own research, I suggest reading the wikipedia pages for AMPAr, Amphetamine, and Excitotoxicity. I also recommend going onto pubmed and looking up 'AMPA PAM excitotoxicity' to see if there's any good hits.",1681165005,jfr53u6,t3_12ceqzx,t1_jfqp3dj,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

bluMidge,"I really appreciate this information!
Oh yeah, I remember sirsadalot very very well.

And I'm going to check out the pinned to his profile in regards to TAK653 you so kindly mentioned.

Preciate' you!

PS edit-I have been prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD-PI for about 12 years now. It was one of those I tend to read about a lot that was diagnosed later in my life.

And boom the lights came on.
I had a really good relationship with Adderall XR until this shortage, and was switched over to Focalin XR, with a ton of trepidation. 

And now after about 3 weeks taking it daily in the the for what it's worth category, I am blown away if you will, by Focalin XR 30 mg daily.

So far it has given me slightly better focus, allowed me to become even more outgoing which hasn't been an issue except for my teenage years and a little bit beyond being unbelievably shy, and finally stepping into who I am. 

It seems to give me more controlled extroversion and I really feel like the attention is there even more so than Adderall IR and XR and most definitely Vyvanse which I took for a couple years some years ago.

***Sorry about the long winded PS as I thought I would add this in for anecdotal reasons, and perhaps maybe helps somebody out down the line or now. 

Thanks again for the kind information!",1681225836,jfu41i9,t3_12ceqzx,t1_jfqnxcz,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
