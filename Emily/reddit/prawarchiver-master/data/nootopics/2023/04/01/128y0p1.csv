EchoingSimplicity,"I can't say anything definitive, but since starting Neboglamine here's some things I've noticed:

* Everything feeling more vivid: First time I took it, I went on a walk an hour after and kept thinking to myself, ""Was there always this much going on around me?"" I noticed more sounds and sights. Just felt like there was a lot more going on. Also seemed to be a bit more present.
* Unblocking of thought patterns: Since starting, it's felt like there's been a lot more options opened up to me...idk how to explain it. Like when I think of the future, I can imagine a lot more possibilities. I've been finding more ways to fill my time, novel ways of doing things. It's subtle, but it's nice. A feeling of being unrestricted in what's possible, I suppose.
* Some mood boost: More cheery, maybe? More optimistic? The world feels a bit brighter, fuller, and it feels like there's a bit more to look forward to.

These results are confounded by some recent changes in my life, so who knows",1680477674,jepybex,t3_128y0p1,t3_128y0p1,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

It works really well in tandem with Tak, Bromantane and tropisetron as well.

I did about 3 intravenous sessions a couple years ago and enjoyed the trips immensely, though I didn’t feel like I was getting any residual benefits, plus the $400 out of pocket per session cost wasn’t easy to do so I stopped. Though, of course, I’ve heard it can take up to 12 sessions to get long lasting benefits. Since then I recently learned about TMS therapy, and I found a clinic that offers it about 15 minutes away from my house, which is very convenient when you have to go 5 days a week for about six weeks. And insurance covered it so I’m just on the hook for a 20 per visit copay. Not sure if any benefits yet, but this clinic also offers the esketamine/nasal ketamine therapy which insurance also covers so I may try this version of ketamine therapy if the TMS doesn’t work.

Pure_Nourishment,"I think I used to deal with anhedonia and I think it was due to developmental trauma and the resulting hypervigilance, followed by numbness (but likely still an overactive threat detector/chronic stress running in the background). Things are better these days and I've done a lot of work. Now, I've found that I just need to re-train myself to get pleasure from effort (e.g. running, weight lifting, making art, etc.). It's easy in today's world to just get quick and easy dopamine hits and when your reward circuitry is in a re-building phase (in my experience), you become extra sensitive to these and it requires hard work and consistency to re-train yourself to get reward through effort and get everything functioning well again. I think I likely need to work on training my nervous system to feel safe as well.

lord_weasel,"After reading some of your replies, I share many of the same issues. If I'm going to do activities, I only really do them if I'm excited about doing it. I thrive with structure, but I also get bored of it after some time. I cycle through patterns of exciting activities, and eventually come back around to the same things when they feel thrilling again (gym, rock climbing, art, coding, etc). I'm constantly trying to keep that atmosphere of intense eagerness when I go about my days. It's pushed me to seek out things like nootropics that can make me feel 'alive', and overall nothing really gets me there. It's not necessarily bad or sad, just profoundly boring. NSI-189 didn't help much, not even after the 3rd round, not consciously anyway. Bromantane has been almost there, but it's hit or miss. In my early 20's I had landmark mental changes I went through, and those feelings of expanding awareness and being-ness came to a peak. After living within that framework for so long, I don't always feel that excited to do things the same way. It has it's ups and downs and I'm continually learning more about myself. It's like you said though, you can retrain yourself back into that mindset.
