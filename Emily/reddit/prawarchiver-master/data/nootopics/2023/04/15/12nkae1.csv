mikorbu,"If you already have good sleep hygiene down (e.g. no blue light 2 hours before bed, blackout curtains, cool bedroom, reading/yoga/Breathwork before bed in place of stimulating activities, or f.lux installed on a laptop to watch a documentary/lighthearted show etc.) then I’d say give 3g of Glycine a whirl.

Basically everyone is deficient as it is, and it’s the primary signaler for the NMDA system, especially in the SCN which controls proper circadian rhythms. It’s cheap, sweet, cools off the body to initiate the sleep cascade, and alongside a cortisol slapper (like phosphatidylserine) was the only thing that fixed a lifelong problem with insomnia for me.

Recently also added some Apigenin with the Glycine out of interest for its anti-aging, NAD+, and GABA/endorphin benefits and I couldn’t even tell you how or when I fell asleep this last week because apparently I just fall into a coma lmao.

Any chance you’ve done a 23andMe or the like? MethylB12/enough choline for methyl groups play an annoyingly large part in regulating the SCN,  melatonin secretion, and sleep architecture. One of the first things that got me to start yawning (which was so exciting I almost couldn’t sleep anyways lmao) was casually adding some TMG to my NMN/Apigenin stack. After enough experimenting I realized I just need extra B12, P5P (especially heavy hitter for me), and choline/ b2 from eggs— and everything onset related has since been working as it should have always been.

Last quick maybe would be trying Epitalon, which on top of telomere benefits also restores normal melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms
