Any_Appointment_6669,"Dang. This hit home.  I stopped 8gpd phenibut last may and just feelin normal again.  That stuff really fucked me up. The wd is easily 10× worse than benzos.  Ptsd from that.  Workin out, vitamins, black seed oil, semax/ selank, bromantane, cerebrolysin and racetams. Micro dose mushrooms supposed to be awesome and ketamin infusions help neural pathways but idk if u can do these if sober. But non addictive and will help repair brain",1681254590,jfw5c8k,t3_12j0qbi,t3_12j0qbi,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"Agmatine should help from what I hear. I've also heard anecdotally of people successfully using picamilon, but that would be more for a taper or acute w/d IMO. It would help prn, but there's supposedly risk of dependence with picamilon.

Emoxypine succinate (aka Mexidol) is possibly worth a try. It should help repair and modulate the GABA receptors without being habit-forming. Not sure if sedating is the right word, mildly anxiolytic.

I'd pick up some modafinil or similar if you need something to get you going.

Polygala tenuifolia may help with mood and anxiety. Nigella Sativa extract from ND is decently sedating, as is carnosic acid.

Though I don't have a great deal of experience with it yet, I would recommend neboglamine for sure.",1681411572,jg4nfvm,t3_12j0qbi,t3_12j0qbi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

XQCW_VIVON420,"Neboglamine is very interesting. I think person to person the acute cognitive benefit may vary based on brain chemistry. For me, it seems to give limited spatial cognition increase, but it puts me in a flow-state better, and it creates a behavioral change that I really like, as I feel more in control of my own actions. It also removed my major depression. On top of all this I think the benefits with Neboglamine will increase over long term, as changing behavior will change future behavior etc etc. It is more of a flow-state drug than something like TAK-653, and it is definitely more acutely noticable than TAK-653.",1681316920,jfzcjhh,t3_12j0qbi,t1_jfyab97,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

greenprettykitty,"Thanks, sounds like something that could be helpful for me. My depression goes away on seemingly random days (very very rarely though, like 3-4 days a year), and I've noticed on those days that I'm in a flow-state and sort of out of my head. Just able to be present. And I'm desperately trying to find the connection for why that's happened on rare occasions because it's not something I've been able to control. Ketamine (prescription suppositories) gets me to that place too, but I honestly don't like the way ketamine makes me feel, plus I get a bad ""hangover"" from it. Ketamine isn't a long term solution for me. 

Of course this will vary from person to person, but what dosage works for your depression? How often are you taking it? And ROA?",1681322793,jfzobbs,t3_12j0qbi,t1_jfzcjhh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
