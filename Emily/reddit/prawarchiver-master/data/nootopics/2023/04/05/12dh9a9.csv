funroll-loop,Definitely plan to get it for my eyes/chronic uveitis… sirsa gave a warning not to use on the eyes because of the benzyl alcohol it’s dissolved in but studies like this (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3332678/) make me think it may not be an issue if it’s a low enough concentration,1680835391,jf9rjvw,t3_12dh9a9,t3_12dh9a9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,I’ve just completed a cycle of SKQ1 Intranasally. It’s not something I expect to feel subjectively different on but I wanted to do it for the long term antioxidant effect. On the discord server there are a few people who have it in their stack IN and use it a few times a week.,1680788612,jf6nguq,t3_12dh9a9,t3_12dh9a9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

funroll-loop,Yeah I added it to eyelid spray and it definitely seems to relieve a lot of dryness and inflammation but I can’t be sure it’s not just the spray. I’m a little more cautious about using it directly on the eye since I’m not sure I got the concentration right for the benzyl alcohol.,1694576929,k0cylr2,t3_12dh9a9,t1_k0azd4b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
