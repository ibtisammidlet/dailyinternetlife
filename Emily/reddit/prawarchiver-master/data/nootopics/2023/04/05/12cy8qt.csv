Counteralgotrucker,"I took powdered bromantane for about two weeks and loved it. Here is the stack 

Bromantane 150*3=450mg

Phenylpiracitam 100*2=200mg

Noopept 10*2=20mg

Picamilon 50mg

Methylene blue 100mg

1 gallon 2% milk : I had no chlorine supplement and had a mental crash the first time I tried that stack. So I bought a gallon of milk and it worked. 

I worked 14 hours a day 5 days a week doing manual labor on that stack.",1680748225,jf4yf53,t3_12cy8qt,t3_12cy8qt,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Theta_10,Personally I haven’t noticed much positive with bromantane however I haven’t used the nasal spray. I’ve only tried it sublingually. I think a sufficient amount of tyrosine is provided with optimal amounts of red meat/chicken. What’s harsher than Adderall XR?,1680739217,jf4entr,t3_12cy8qt,t3_12cy8qt,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

OutrageousAward,"It's interesting to see what people do with these Nootropics. I've been digging into my  books like a madman...turns out I really did not understand ALOT of stuff that I thought I understood. These Nootropics have been a game changer. Went all the way back to the basics i.e. logic, semantics, philosophy etc... It's like I have a new brain. I do both i.e. manual labor-because I enjoy it, and corporate 9-5ish cause it pays better-but hate corporate BS.",1681391605,jg38o3c,t3_12cy8qt,t1_jf4yf53,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
AnabolicGreyhound,"Off label amphetamines lol, yeah reports on oral/sublingual admin are hit and miss, which brand did you use out of interest?

I tend to consume meat and some tyrosine when I take pre up to 4/5g a week so sure I’ll be getting more than enough.",1680790604,jf6s1zw,t3_12cy8qt,t1_jf4entr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
