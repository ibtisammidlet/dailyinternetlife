As someone who has MCAS with chronic dry/irritated eyes and chronic low grade neuroinflammation, SkQ1 looks like an interesting option for helping me. However, there is almost no info about SkQ1 online so hoping someone can help me with some questions.  


1. What dose and route of administration of SkQ1 is recommended?  

2. Would other routes than eye drops still help with chronic dry/irritated eyes or would you need something  specific like Visomitin eye drops for the chronic dry eyes?  

3. Is SkQ1 effective for neuroinflammation?  

4. Anyone here who has experience trying SkQ1? If yes, what was your experience and was it worth it?  

5. How is SkQ1 compared to the other mitochondrial supplements on everychem like idebenone and PQQ?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Information and experiences about SkQ1?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/12dh9a9/information_and_experiences_about_skq1/

A boost to exercise performance would also be a bolus.

Having moved away from RX stims (Adderall) and before that even harsher compounds my stack today is much more tame, focussed on cognitive health and function: 

- Citicoline
- ALCAR
- EPA/DHA
- B Complex
- Shilajit
- Polygala
- Tongkat
- Agmatine
- Sabroxy 
- Yerba Mate, Green Tea or pre-workout

My questions as someone with no Bromantane experience would be:

Tips on maximal absorption via intranasal administration?

What has been your optimal Tyrosine intake to make use of TH enzyme up-regulation?

Your favourite nootropics synergies and why they combine well?

Acute affects and impact on cognitive function long term?

Bloodwork analysis following Bromantane?
