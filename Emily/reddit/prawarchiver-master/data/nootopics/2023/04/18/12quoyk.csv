Thankkratom,"I find that 200-800mcg Semax works great with low doses of bromantane. For example 25-30mg sublingual or one spray of the 9mg nose spray. I think that Semax tolerance actually gets lower with use so 600-800mcg may be good for a week and then lower the dose, personally I donâ€™t use Semax for more than 3-4weeks, with a good 2 month break at minimum. Bromantane I can use 5-6 days a week for long periods and it does not seem to cause problems, as long as the dosage stays low. Both Semax and Bromantane have long lasting positive effects after weeks for use IMO.",1681845658,jgs7pr6,t3_12quoyk,t3_12quoyk,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
Agreeable-Suspect986,"I use both and very enjoy the effects. I take them early or i'll struggle to sleep.
I also cycle Semax (a few weeks on, a few weeks off).
Bromantane is awesome, i take it IN (5mg to 25mg) often with Semax.",1682173861,jh9uodj,t3_12quoyk,t3_12quoyk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
No_Internet1557,I use both but I do have trouble sleeping. I take 600-900mcg semax and 50mg bromantane. Made the mistake of doing 200mg bromantane in the evening and literally couldn't sleep,1693196070,jy1st15,t3_12quoyk,t3_12quoyk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
