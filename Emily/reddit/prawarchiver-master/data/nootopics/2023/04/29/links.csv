I have been prescribed Lyrica (75mg daily) for the last 6 months and looking to stop taking altogether.

I noticed I'm rather irritable as I tried to stop cold turkey last few days..

Can Fasoracetam help restore/repair my gaba centers so I can get off this Lyrica crap?

I believe it wasn't conclusive that Fasoracetam restored repaired gaba receptors. (long term or without rebound effect)

I think I have about a gram of Fasoracetam, any advice on best application and if this could help me out?

Thank you!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Can Fasoracetam repair/restore gaba receptors from 6 month Lyrica (75mg) daily prescription?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/132mc9o/can_fasoracetam_repairrestore_gaba_receptors_from/
