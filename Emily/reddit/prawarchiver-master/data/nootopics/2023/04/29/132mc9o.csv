BigGayMule13,"Lyrica produces a minor to modest increase in gaba brainwide, but it doesn't function as a gaba agonist whatsoever. It's a potent alpha 2 delta voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor. If you get relief at all from fasoracetam, it's likely not gaba-b mediated which is the receptor it upregulates. That said, faso is a metabotropic glutamate agonist which often reduces ionotropic glutamate activity... Which may in fact help.",1682753927,ji5r660,t3_132mc9o,t3_132mc9o,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"I'm in the same boat as you! Tapering down from 300mg/day (150mg twice daily), now at 150mg. 

As has been said, it's a bit deceiving, but it's MoA doesn't involve GABA for a significant part(it does increase GABA-transport).

It's called pregabalin because it's just the GABA-molecule with a minor modification, so any resemblance is structurally, not so much pharmacologically. It inhibits α2δ-subunit containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC's). Now for a long time I thought this meant it inhibits the VGCC's at nerve terminals that are responsible for the release of neurotransmitters when an electrical signal arrives.

To my surprise I found later that they are an independent receptor that is responsible for the formation of excitatory synapses in the brain, called α2δ-1, and has its own endogenous ligands called thrombospondins(TSP). [1]

I was very unhappy when I read this, because suppressing the formation of synapses obviously impairs neuroplasticity. The press-release(2009) I was reading was comfortably titled ""Neurontin and Lyrica are Highly Toxic to New Brain Synapses"". [2] 
It's stupid I ever got on this medication without properly researching it, but it was a tumultuous and hectic time.

Then later on I found out it can probably cause depression by causing hippocampal atrophy, due to the synaptogenesis suppresion.


Reading more about it just now I find this nice 2017 article bashing on pregabalin's MoA and potential side-effects: [Neurontin and Lyrica Adverse Effects: The Saga Continues [3]](https://www.wellnessresources.com/news/neurontin-and-lyrica-adverse-effects-the-saga-continues)
Good on them!

What the heck kind of ridiculousness does this absolute trash med have in store for us now? Unfortunately I'm really out of time, it's 7 am, still awake and this post got a bit more detailed than I'd anticipated. Maybe I'll finish it later today as I haven't even gotten around to any advice yet, which is what you asked for. 

So I'll stop at this cliffhanger, but scanning the article I read: Impaired prenatal development of the fetus, musclular atrophy(within 21 days!), brain shrinkage(in fibromyalgia patients after short-term use), increased infection, vision abnormalities, suicide, sleep apnea, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and worsening of some autoimmune neurological disorders. Oh and it's also toxic to mitochondria... 
BUT ""Once the drug was discontinued, the adverse effects were reversible"", phew!


Well we're in this together at least, and be happy it was just 6 months, I'm looking at almost 5 years. I didn't mean to scare anyone ofcourse, I just think these meds deserve a proper bashing and it's important to raise awareness, so others won't wind up on it thinking it's just your average pain-killer/anxiolytic.

On a positive note, the brain is very plastic so if it did do any damage to ours, no worries, we can easily recover.

Two most important pieces of advice I can quickly surmise before I go to sleep:
1. There are 25mg formulations every pharmacy should have, so just ask your doc to prescribe 6 of those instead of your normal 2x 75. That way I just did a 25mg bump down every week without me noticing anything. It's the simplest of tricks I often use for tapering, making the steps so small that you've got no way of noticing what it's doing.
2. During and or after tapering look into neurogenic compounds to make sure your brain can repair any potential damage done (I'm not saying you have any damage!):

Particularly effective would be Cerebrolysin as this will work in just about any location in the brain, flooding it with growth factors. Injection is most effective/fastest, but many of us apply it intranasally using a spray, which is much more comfortable and this way the peptides can be transported to the brain directly, without having to go through the blood.
For hippocampal-regeneration look into NSI-189, this option is a lot more experimental though, but it was shown to be safe in phase-I & -II clinical trials.
BPC-157 is another option, it's a peptide that induces healing throughout the body, wether it's a wound or joint injury. It appears to have similar actions on the CNS, but also in terms of balancing out neurotransmitter levels and disregulated receptors. Downside is it made me so sleepy that I discontinued after 5 days; this seems common, but doesn't occur in the majority of people. Also more experimental, mainly all animal trials, but seems to be used by quite a large number of people, primarily due to it's popularity for sport injuries.
3. TBC...

If I may ask what did you get it prescribed for / what are your symptoms? If you'd be willing to share then we might be able to suggest more tailored solutions! If you have any questions about such compounds I mentioned, pm me or better yet, join the Discord server. The best of luck and let's compare notes / check-in sometime :)

PS: I happen to be using fasoracetam as well atm to help with a baclofen (GABA-B agonist) taper. Most effective would be 15-30mg doses spread throughout the day for a steady and continuous concentration, but practically a 50mg sublingual dosage before bed works very well and is often used. I'm playing around with it atm. I've never heard of any rebound effects.

turner150,"I am only taking 75mg once a day not x2.

Also I was prescribed it from a doctor in treatment and not my regular doctor but this doctor  provided a few months worth.

I haven't really disclosed to my family/regular doctor as I was advised it wouldn't be a big deal to stop 75mg once a day so I didn't think it be necessary. I just not longer like the way its making me feel and getting worried of addiction (+don't feel I need anymore)

Now I'm worried because I hear of bad withdrawals and I have about 20 tablets left

I was hoping to just be able to stop.

Would volumizing a capsule in water and breaking it up make the most sense? will it stay stable?

I'm willing to go through the withdrawal if it's only a few days of discomfort but I feel like I may be underestimating",1683348938,jj1z4pn,t3_132mc9o,t1_jiee2w7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

SunDevil329,"I'm tempted to say cold turkey may be the best option, as that's literally the lowest dose it's prescribed at.

I'd recommend alternating days you take it to every other (so take it Sun, Tues, Thurs, Sat and abstain on Mon, Weds, Fri, for example). Do this for a week or two, then stop completely.

Specifically, Lyrica (pregabalin) is a gabapentenoid. As a previous reply noted, the primary MoA is via inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). Of particular note, pregabalin does not bind to GABA receptors.

I'm thinking Agmatine sulfate may help. If you really need something to take the edge off, picamilon may help, but I'd be careful of over relying on it (it's potentially habit-forming). Stresam is another option and is a non-addictive sedating anxiolytic, though it tends to be pricey.

Agmatine can be found fairly easily (I think ND carries it, I just use BulkSupplements now). The other two are most easily available via Cosmic Nootropics.",1682815170,ji8zh3m,t3_132mc9o,t1_ji5rc8e,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
UNAcceptable_Value,"you should taper the dose, 

while using something else to get you through..  depends on your body, drop 25 mg, wait a few, drop another 25 mg, wait a few to get stable, drop another 25 mg..

emoxypine succinate (mexidol), fasoracetam, nsi-189, adamax or whatever that get you through and protect your brain, other possible of helping you, noopept, epitalon, cjc-no dac..  phosphatidylserine and citocoline. 

normally between a month or 3 more or less each drop, for me I need more as I'm victim of other drugs and psychiatry

Hydralazine helps me but it's a risky one, as for some due to gene expression it causes autoimmune issues on some people,  anyway, share whats helping if you can, go slow, no need to undergo severe torture, do it slowly to adapt and continue with your taper,
