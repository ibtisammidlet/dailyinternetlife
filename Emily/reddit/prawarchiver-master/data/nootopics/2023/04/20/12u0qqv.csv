neuro__atypical,"Something to keep in mind is that, while TAK, agmatine, etc. (not neboglamine) are commonly cited to treat depression similarly to or the same way as ketamine, none of them are HDAC5 inhibitors. HDAC5 inhibition is thought to be another important mechanism underlying ketamine's antidepressant effects. HDAC5 inhibition + NMDA/AMPAergic action is probably more efficacious than NMDA/AMPAergic action alone.",1682101743,jh6cgbt,t3_12u0qqv,t3_12u0qqv,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"The ketamine literature seem to suggest an antidepressant effect of about one month in duration. That might be worth it to you to see what it feels like to have the veil of depression lifted. As for breakthrough treatments, the psilocybin and transcranial magnetic stimulation data seem to suggest a much longer antidepressant effect. 

This might not be what youâ€™re asking. But Neboglamine, or another over-the-counter (St. Johnâ€™s Wort, saffron, fish oil, agmatine, etc.) might be better maintenance strategy after a ketamine or psilocybin trial. 

Glad youâ€™re delving into it yourself, as it is notoriously difficult to get advice on everything thatâ€™s out there. 

Good luck, and keep us posted.",1682084939,jh56xt1,t3_12u0qqv,t3_12u0qqv,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
XQCW_VIVON420,"Ketamine does not have a similar mechanism of action to Neboglamine. While it does act on NMDA, it is an NMDA antagonist, while Neboglamine is a NMDA Glycine Site PAM (Not to be confused with a NMDA PAM). NMDA antagonists are anticognitive, and even if they have some benefits in some areas, if taken long-term, they normally create a cognitive deficit in terms of memory or spatial cognition. If neboglamine works for you (and additionally pinealon/agmatine), then it makes more sense to use those as they have a benefit to cognition and longevity rather than creating a negative impact.",1682088583,jh5fhuw,t3_12u0qqv,t3_12u0qqv,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

I understand that he cannot recommend research chemicals per se, but maybe we could at least have a discussion regarding safety and mechanisms and whether we think ketamine would be good for me to pursue, which I'm guessing he would be in support of given that there is clinical evidence more readily available for it currently",1682111058,jh6ze1f,t3_12u0qqv,t1_jh6cgbt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
