Interestingly, I just got a phone call saying that I've been bumped all the way to the top of the waitlist to receive ketamine treatment for depression (I was expecting a 6-12 month wait!). I had just received Neboglamine in the mail though and took my first dose lastnight with positive results. Between the subjectively positive experience and the promise the literature shows, I'm confused as to whether I should just keep trying the Neboglamine or take advantage of this opportunity that, obviously, will not come around every day.

From what I'm reading, it seems as though Neboglamine has similar mechanisms to ketamine, to some degree, and it has antidepressant properties. Now, I'm left wondering: what do I do? I know y'all can't give me medical advice, so I won't ask you to. I just want to know, based on your knowledge (or maybe experience, as well), does ketamine offer potential benefits over Neboglamine? Does Neboglamine offer benefits over ketamine? How do the mechanisms differ? Do you think, if you remove me from the situation and treat this as a hypothetical, it's worth trying ketamine? ..or is Neboglamine just superior and it's not worth giving ketamine a shot?

Any benefit or risk of taking them together? As in, ketamine one day, Neboglamine the next?
