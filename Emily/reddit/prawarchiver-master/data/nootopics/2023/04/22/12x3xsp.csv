DizzyTechnician8,"I’ve only taken it 4 days so I’m waiting to write up a full report. It has been nothing short of remarkable for my treatment resistant depression and the accompanied brainfog, antisocialness, and anxiety.

I did not see a huge concentration boost, so I plan to take Focalin alongside it when necessary.",1682351655,jhj6zzw,t3_12x3xsp,t1_jhhgyt9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

DizzyTechnician8,"Unfortunately the effects tapered a few days after. I tried bumping the dosage of Neboglamine to 60mg with no luck. I also took a week break to see if there was a tolerance build up. No dice.

Anyway, I’ve moved on to TAK-653 which has had similar effects for me and with no tapered effects going on a week and a half!",1684891010,jlda66g,t3_12x3xsp,t1_jk5lx72,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
