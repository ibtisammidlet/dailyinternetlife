Legitimate_Banana512,"Use prl-853, it's a god given for verbal fluency etc, although it's a bit dubbele, it does it's work",1699047387,k7pi3oc,t3_17me3f7,t3_17me3f7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Thank you, I had heard about that.  

How much should I take?

I’ve tried 500 mg 3x a day in the past but didn’t notice much difference….definitely open to taking more if it will help though",1699388020,k89dksw,t3_17me3f7,t1_k86rqil,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Yeah I did hear about that, but that it might go away with regular use.

Is it the anti cholinergic effects?  The NMDA antagonism?",1699019936,k7ngczo,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7nbmza,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Nice I’ll give it a try, I have some in my collection.

Does it need to be taken regularly to work?  Or does it work right away?",1699059594,k7qba2i,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7pi3oc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ImpressiveAd6357,"I’m taking 1-1,5g in the morning and sometimes another g in the afternoon. It got a half life of about 12 hours in the brain, so taking it once daily should be sufficient for that purpose.",1699416624,k8bcqmo,t3_17me3f7,t1_k89dksw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,"Tropisetron’s pro-cognitive effect comes from it being an a7 nicotinic receptor agonist, while memantine is an antagonist. There were a couple of other big negatives that were listed elsewhere, but these seem all related to its core mechanisms of action…so the negatives won’t go away with regular use. 

You’re already trying to get away from Kratom because of the downsides, you shouldn’t try to add on new substances that have big negatives when there are other nootropics, supplements and medications that are better.",1699021830,k7nl5mk,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7ngczo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Fair point….maybe I’ll try TAK, Neboglamine, or 9-me-bc instead.

Tropisetron sounded promising, but the constipation was a dealbreaker. (Literally toxic waste trapped in the body)",1699023712,k7nq4nd,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7nl5mk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
qdouble,"Yeah, TAK and Nebo are good. I feel the same way about Trop not being worth the constipation. I recently started using Roxadustat… beyond being a PED, its nootropic benefits are underrated. It improves dopamine transporter function and increases dopamine synthesis. It has other nootropic benefits as well.",1699024671,k7nso40,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7nq4nd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Interesting, I haven’t done much research into Roxadustat yet, other than it’s effects on hypoxia and anemia.  Didn’t know it helped dopamine.  Definitely something to consider for the future.",1699025641,k7nva60,t3_17me3f7,t1_k7nso40,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
