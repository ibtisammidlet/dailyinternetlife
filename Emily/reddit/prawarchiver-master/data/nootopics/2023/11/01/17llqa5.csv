Upset_Scientist3994,"Selank peptide? Intresting about that is, that it increases serotonin output, but also increases its metabolism once level of that becomes too high. This is most fascinating about that, as serotonin syndrome is very underrated thing but believed to play a large part behind social anxiety disorders.",1698939076,k7ion8e,t3_17llqa5,t3_17llqa5,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Tryptophan before bedtime, so that you have serotonin substrate + some necessary vitamins for cofactors for natural production. As what I understood it is not harmful if your serotonin output is high just that it can be removed whenever needed - and it is that thing what SSRI meds interfere, creating thus all sorts of side effects. 

Some herbs such as Bacopa may spur your nervous system to create more serotonin. 

Pinealon peptide what though is more expensive but considerable for medicine substitute should do that thing more strongly, and mayby with more permanent impact.",1698938803,k7inwqa,t3_17llqa5,t3_17llqa5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Earesth99,"So you think doctors know there is a way to get the good effects of an ssri without the side effects, but doctors are still prescribing an ssri instead?

Do you think all of them are plotting against you personally?   

Joking aside, a lot of psychiatric meds have side effects and are only effective for a portion of those who take them.

Drugs that impact gaba are calming, but have their own set of side effects. Gabapentin helps some, as does kava, a non addictive anxiolytic.  Benzos as well, but they are addictive snd will hurt your memory.

Cardiovascular exercise is as effective as antidepressants according to research.  Of course it’s hard to get started if you are really anxious or depressed. 

Talk therapy helps as well.

Doctors focus more on meds. Of course that’s why we go to them because they are the only ones who can prescribe them!",1698935558,k7if8k6,t3_17llqa5,t3_17llqa5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
