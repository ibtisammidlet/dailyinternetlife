Current Cycle:

Oxiracetam 800 mg 2x per day

Alpha GPC 400 mg 1-2x per day

ALCar 1 gram every other day 

I’m three weeks into this cycle.  There was some subtle improvement in my memory and verbal fluency.  My mood has been a little down lately though. (Probably unrelated, unless I’m taking too much choline, but I think it’s because my prolactin is high again.)

I also take DexMethylPhenidate 10 mg IR 2-3 x per day, 5 days a week (unfortunately my ADHD is really bad and I haven’t found a nootropic to replace it.)

Im addicted to Kratom (unfortunately…it got me sober though,  but raises my prolactin.)

My goals for my next cycle are:

More energy / motivation 

Reduce Kratom consumption 

Lower Prolactin 

Reduce anxiety/dread 

Improve verbal fluency / social skills (I have mild Asperger’s, but I can usually hide it and function well.)

Possibly reduce tolerance to methylphenidate (this is probably a long shot though)

Memantine sounds like it might be a good candidate.  Im thinking of titrating up to 10-20 mg, maybe for 3 weeks, and then try something else (possibly another racetam.)

Side questions too:  Would the d2 agonism of Memantine be strong enough to lower prolactin?  And possibly increase motivation and desire?

When stopping Memantine after ~3 weeks would there be d2 downregulation?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Memantine Cycle to follow a racetam cycle?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17me3f7/memantine_cycle_to_follow_a_racetam_cycle/
