Jasjones777,I had 5g of modafinil powder arrive today from antiracetam.eu. Iâ€™m somewhat apprehensive although they do seem legit.  I will try it and give my opinion .,1705594143,kig8nqt,t3_17p8hqi,t1_k8401q8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Drewcastle,"What analogue is most effective and less dangerous? That fluorine of flmodafinil  it scares me a lot.

And  why is so hard  to get normal modafinil compared with analogues?  Isn't the patent supposed to have expired years ago?",1699302460,k848g6n,t3_17p8hqi,t1_k846o3t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Aeon81,I ordered Bromantane and Modafinil. Have not tried Broma yet but Moda kept me awake and seems to be of quality.,1699348933,k86y3c5,t3_17p8hqi,t1_k843v5j,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"I have tried their produce and seem working. When using a lot of things hard to say. Coluracetam is only really only thing what can be distinguished, as it gives this microdose-like visual enhancement rapidly you cannot make mistake on. Their product did that, and quite strongly. So at least that is genuinely good. 

There is lot of threads how this and that from this and that company dont work, but problem is that any nootropic user will use multitude of other stuff in their stack at same time and whatever the combination happens to be makes things different, and life situation, season, whatever. Most of nootropics are very subtle, and even something praised superpill Modafinil can actually be that too unless you are underslept when you notice diminishing of dysforia out of that. That is reason why there are so much rumours, although there may be genuine problems with quality too with many companies or their subcontractors. 

But since at least that one example mentioned above works which you cannot make mistake on, at least something they can put out genuine. And rest seem to do something as well. 

I also heard that Moda from that company does work too.",1699462625,k8dmo8h,t3_17p8hqi,t1_k843v5j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I find it pairs well with guanfacine",1700258958,k9oy2ex,t3_17p8hqi,t1_k9ommty,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
