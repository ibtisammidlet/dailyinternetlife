I am about to try Bromantane, but I am extreme sensitive to any medication or supplement since long covid. 
I'm afraid to take new drugs that can have  long-term side effects. For example, I took SSRI only 2 weeks and had 1 months of horrible side effects after stopping it. I took an antiretroviral, it was too strong for me, I needed to stop after 1 month and had 2 weeks of vertigo after stopping it. But the worst thing was monoxidil. I used it 5 days and I had 8 months of nightmare, the biggest crisis of my Long Covid.

I did not see any bad reaction to Bromantane, but I am wondering if someone had long term side effects ? 

I really want to improve my daily life because I am housebound, but I want to be sure that something is safe.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane : Are there any long-term negative effects?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17pqxs5/bromantane_are_there_any_longterm_negative_effects/

What bothers me with the substance is the relatively short duration and (dependent on dosage) crash afterwards.

I can't find any information on reddit or anywhere else.

Looking at these websites, some of them look quite shady, but others look professional (although these last ones don't offer a starting price, I guess they sell wholesale and there is a bargaining option)?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Are there reliable sellers of modafinil powder?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17p8hqi/are_there_reliable_sellers_of_modafinil_powder/
