MezDez,What does it do for you and what duration do you get from it?,1699349570,k86yu6k,t3_17posj4,t3_17posj4,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Intresting as Nooglutyl is actually widely availible thing, and said to be good. Nobody just uses or buys it ever - which is the reason why it is always availible - for the reason you mentioned that it has ridicilously tiny duration. But would it be a problem always if occasionally used for short term tasks? If simply taken numerous times a day if to afford it? 

How would you describe the effect, since I am somewhat intrested about it too? I understood it is related to Noopept and Racetam style substance category what goes fine for me, but is more of close to organic things what they used to research in Russia. So I am intrested to hear an anecdote of mysterious nootropic being around for a good time, but still quite unknown among user group of those.",1699354175,k874kdz,t3_17posj4,t3_17posj4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

ImpressiveAd6357,"It gives me very clear focus for about 3 hours with some anxiolytic properties. At around 10-15 mg it makes me more clear headed and with around 20-25mg I also get some stimulation and also more motivation than with lower dose. Usually I take less when combing with other stimulants. The higher the dosage the more the crash afterwards, so worse concentration than before taking it.",1699381707,k88w218,t3_17posj4,t1_k86yu6k,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ImpressiveAd6357,"I’m using it mainly at the end of the day when I want to still get some hours of productivity in. I’m not doing it earlier in the day because of the crash that can occur. It gives me very clear focus for about 3 hours with some anxiolytic properties. At around 10-15 mg it makes me more clear headed and with around 20-25mg I also get some stimulation and also more motivation than with lower dose. Usually I take less when combing with stimulants. The higher the dosage the more the crash afterwards, so worse concentration than before taking it. Redosing unfortunately isn’t that effective, you still get effects but less than with the first dose and more of a crash afterwards.
But apart from that I really like the effects and therefore would be really nice if there is a substance with same or very similar effects but double or triple the duration.",1699381762,k88w7wt,t3_17posj4,t1_k874kdz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ImpressiveAd6357,"In comparison to Noopept I find Nooglutyl more clear-headed and more motivating. The latter could also be related to the anxiolytic properties. With Nooglutyl I just get started and get stuff done whereas with Noopept that is not necessarily the case, at least not that strong. Also I get even less easily distracted with Nooglutyl.",1700156702,k9j16v4,t3_17posj4,t1_k8f82vg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"Cool if that can be taken as-needed basis, and with in mind advisory to do it in evenings when rest of stack starts to wear off. 

But if you are familiar to Racetams or Noopept, how would you compare as Nooglutyl is often compared with them by mode of action? 

And if you are seeking longer lasting alternatives see the sentence above, explore from that and then post here your anecdotal experiences which are very much in demand.",1699439590,k8c9b9c,t3_17posj4,t1_k88w7wt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
UltimateEnd0,"Nooglutyl is the nootropic closest to NZT imo and it came out around the same time as Limitless. When stacked with other compounds like subulthiamine, citicholine, alpha-gpc, kanna and cannabis then some interesting things happen.",1703923696,kfj544o,t3_17posj4,t1_k9j16v4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

In comparison to Aniractem I would say the anxiolytic properties are stronger and it also gives more clear-headedness. I like Aniractem but sometimes I get a little bit spaced out from it. I don’t have this with Nooglutyl. Can’t really compare to Faso- and Coluracetam since it’s probably a year ago that I took them the last time. Phenylpircatem and PPH give more energy then Nooglutyl but they don’t got the anxiolytic properties. Oxi- and Pramiracetam I only took a few times, didn’t like them that much, and RGPU-95 I didn’t took that often yet, so can’t really compare with those.",1700156887,k9j1phg,t3_17posj4,t1_k8c9b9c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
