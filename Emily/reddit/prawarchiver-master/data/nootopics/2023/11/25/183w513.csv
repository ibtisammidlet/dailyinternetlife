themanintheback7,I’ve tried both they work pretty well and 4DMA lasts longer however out of anything that affects the TrkB or BDNF they are the most likely to mess with sleep if you take them in the afternoon so that is something to keep in mind. Beyond that there is definitely a tolerance that can build to both so breaks are necessary.,1700961546,karz6kc,t3_183w513,t3_183w513,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"7,8 dhf is actually a trkb agonist unless I’ve missed some research I don’t think it raises rather than acts like bdnf.

Semax’s pharmacology is pretty broad and its effects may very well come through other mechanisms than the ultimate rise in bdnf. So it’s different it’s a different experience. Personally 7,8 dhf is good acutely and semax is better for longer term.",1701180648,kb48n95,t3_183w513,t3_183w513,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

yungtemple,Semax not as nuch TrkB? Which Semax do u feel tired on? NA is supposed to stim.,1701228877,kb7rcsr,t3_183w513,t1_kb48n95,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
themanintheback7,Not quite it can definitely boost your mood like semax although it’s much more of a wakefulness promotor because of its effect on orexin and more likely to cause overstimulation at higher doses,1700981395,kat297m,t3_183w513,t1_kas0umm,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Well it just works differently. It is a possible ligand of some  receptors that have a broad effect on things from sex drive to skin tone. So there’s just more going on and I’ve done a bunch of research on semax and don’t remember a study with specific data on bdnf or definitely trkb upregulation. So it’s hard to say.

One thing is for sure 7,8 dhf binds to the trkb receptor.
Semax involves bdnf and trkb but there are different variables at play. Probably why you were saying there are non responders.",1701229772,kb7tbqb,t3_183w513,t1_kb7rcsr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

themanintheback7,"For me I’d say they’re good to alternate between but it depends on the person, if DHF is messing with your sleep it’s probably best to stick with semax and if semax is making you feel exhausted then it’s probably better to stick with DHF",1701035804,kaw3zv4,t3_183w513,t1_katgnlg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"I'm one of those people who often feel tired while taking Semax.
I wonder what could be the cause of it, as I don't find any conclusive element about it (and some people report feeling stimulated with Semax)...strangely, I'd even say that I don't feel the same kind of tiredness with Selank.

About DHF, it's indeed a wakefulness promoter, among other things. Not a strong one like Modafinil, but it's quite interesting when you have very long days of work.",1701170320,kb3q0la,t3_183w513,t1_kaw3zv4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
themanintheback7,It’s probably that semax can drop your cortisol levels there’s a few reports on here if people getting their cortisol levels tested while taking semax and they come out low but return to normal after semax is stopped,1701203098,kb5x67m,t3_183w513,t1_kb3q0la,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"It makes sense!
It may have lowered my cortisol a bit too much whil adding it to my usual stack.

Efik_Pail,"4-DMA 7'8-DHF, which is a synthetically modified 7,8-DHF, is more potent (you take low doses, I think the ND pills are 10mg) and it lasts much longer (maybe too long for some people).
It's also more expensive and harder to find (I don't know many suppliers beside Nootropics Depot).",1701330028,kbdlua8,t3_183w513,t1_kb7rhmf,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"Effects are similar, just more pronounced with 4-DMA (but you can still get about the same effects while increasing your dose of regular 7,8-DHF)

I'd say it depends of your way of life, your rhythm: main difference between them is the very long half life.

On big work days, I wake up at 5.30, I am at my job at 7.15 until about 17.00 and at home I still have work to complete until about 20.00, so long half life is a plus for me, to avoid redosing.

But it you wake up at 8.00 or 9.00 and plan to go to bed quite early, 4-DMA will be problematic for your sleep.

So, it's up to you!",1701428634,kbj75qh,t3_183w513,t1_kbiltws,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
