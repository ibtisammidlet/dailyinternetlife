**The main Question:**   
Hello, Im wondering if you guys know how to upregulate GABA-B expression in any way shape or form? Can be regarding the receptors or endogenous synthesis etc.

**Explanation**
This because I noticed that however it works.. Phenibut, related to Baclofen, cured me. But I'd prefer avoiding potential harm, and addressing closer to the cause of low GABA-B expression would be even better.

***This ^ was pretty much all you'd need to know***_, but if you like I go into more details about my specifics that might help further answering my question:_

**How does Phenibut 'cure' me?:**    
***-Positive influence:*** It normalises certain behavior; enables cognitive switching _(holding task related bifurcations in mind instead of linear hyperpolarization)_;

 thus it makes me able to reevaluate my current thoughts/actions during a sustained task, preventing dysfunctional sustained behavior. This reevalution likely happens at intervals over longer times and at points when percieved reward becomes noticably low. Nornally reward only matters for initiation, so I can end up mindlessly continueing doing something, even when at some points I notice it might no longer be worth doing it. These points somehow do not trigger reevaluation of reward, that aspect of inhibitory control is lost.

***-High specificity:*** It does not have much other effects than the mentioned normalization of behaviour; It does not emotionally or recreationally feel desired in any percievable way; it likely is not as habit forming for me.  
***No side effects:*** Related to specificity; it does not seem to cause noticable side effects.    
***Inverse withdrawal:*** Related to specificity; I do not conciously experience any withdrawal signs, controversially I even notice it having continuous positive influence on my behavior in the days after a dosage.
 
What are some points/keywords/leads I have? (Regarding my specific deficits, beware of informational bias here):    
-OCD/>ADHD.  
-Overactive: Insula.  
-Fixated behaviors: Lacking task interference from Default Mode network on performing networks. _'Sustains' acting on tasks too long, 'obsrssions'._    
-Altough overexcitable, lacking anxious feelings/behaviors that are most commonly talked about. Noticably high Harm avoidance and low social anxiety.  
-Likely some Frontal dysfunctions, as related to ADHD. (Which often has underactive regulations of inhibition, related to networks which include a2adregenic receptors, that might have a GABAergic cause and effect).   

-Underactive: Ventral Vagal/parasympathetic, but bias towards hypoventilation(maybe even ->hypoxia) instead of assumptiously more stress related hyperventilation",False,t5_4aoxhu,GABA-B upregulation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17zjy07/gabab_upregulation/
