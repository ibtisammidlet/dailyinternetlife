e59e59,"Receptor level: lithium orotate, fasoracetam. (Caffeine and nicotine also, likely irrelevant though).


Gene expression: selank and its more potent successors.


Other mechanisms but comparable subjective effects + other advantages: neboglamine, tropisetron. 


Having tried all these, phenibut, and more - I'd say NA-selank and tropisetron work the best.

Not to discount what you went through, any withdrawal is the hardest thing someone will go through in their life. But, that being said; Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol are the worst withdrawals out there in that order. GHB would be next, then phenibut and other gaba b drugs.

People also don't understand that the withdrawals from gaba substances do cause semi permanent damage to the central nervous system. They also don't understand that the withdrawals from ANY depressants cause SIGNIFICANT trauma. Which needs to be healed.

I read that a lot. Somehow I don't notice an emotional/rewarding or perceptive difference with ohenibut or sober. I wonder if I'd be a fool to think that that might think it works differently for me

I think it's possible you respond stronger to selank, they are derived from two different compounds at least (ACTH v tuftsin). The n-acetyl version was much stronger to me, to the point it nearly had recreational value. Noticed quite a bit less from semax comparatively. 


I got some fatigue around the time I was trying out neboglamine but never attributed them to each other, interesting. I wasn't aware it had GABAA implications? It certainly felt more like being exhausted than being sedated.",1700492387,ka0tpug,t3_17zjy07,t1_ka0k5vm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

mak48,"What’s the permanent damage? Just out of curiosity. 

Also I’m 7 months no-booze. I’d gone through minor alcohol withdraws 2-3 times after some heavy 3-5 day “drink the whole time” benders. I have to say, the WD from phenibut was worse IME. Like… 3-4 days of “this is only getting worse,” no end in sight, skin crawling feeling, worst anxiety  ever… and no sleep. It felt like alcohol WD but up two levels. And then suddenly just vanished day 5. Could be my experience, but I thought phenibut was worse than alcohol. I can’t imagine benzos being even worse… scares me to think about.

I did also try Nebaglomine (next to Nefiracetam). Nebaglomine did not have any noticable effect on me at any dose

Hmm, oke than I will test it! Does it also hold impactful risks like hair loss with semax, or is it generally safe?

Every personally novel anti-stress mechanism is of interest to be explored. As stress and perfetionism are more impactfully limiting me than 'intellegence'.
