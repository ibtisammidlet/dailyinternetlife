Alcohol for MPH/concerta (obviously don't do this).


CYP2D6 inhibitors for Vyvanse, they tend to be SSRIs though. This is the only thing I tried (amp sulphate+ bupropion, horribly noradrenergic - probably cause of NRI effects overtaking any potentiation from CYP2D6I).


Avoiding acids and specifically vitamin c.
 Sodium bicarbonate and the likes can even slow amph excretion, which makes it last longer. Someone here mentioned omega3 also reducing efficacy of amphetamines. 


Tiny amounts of weak MAOIs (but you should already know this is very risky, even if it may work well).

Brandonvlchek,I’m on Concerta 72mg and I’ve noticed that I’ve gained quite a tolerance so to combat this i take L-Tyrosine. I also take a low dose of aspirin which increases tyrosine hydroxylase thereby increasing dopamine. I also take Forskolin which also increases Tyrosine hydroxylase. At night I take ZMA because magnesium and zinc are NMDA antagonists and they reduce tolerance.,1704309394,kg5zpj4,t3_181ulzm,t3_181ulzm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Been using 9-me-bc to help speed up the recovery….its been incredibly helpful, particularly with the anhedonia and fatigue.  It’s not stimulating per se, but doing basic tasks doesn’t feel so daunting, I can get out of bed Easy, etc 

Unfortunately I’ll eventually have to go back on the meds.

I saw you mentioned Concerta…,do you like that better than IR?

CryptoEscape,"Thank you for the warning.

From what I’ve researched and experienced so far, the MAOI properties *seem* very subtle….although I can’t prove this (correct me if I’m wrong please)

Personally I’m trying to stay off the stimulants, and I’ve cut my Kratom use in half.  

The main point of staying off the stimulants is to let everything repair to its max.

Life’s been difficult, exhausting, and boring without the stimulants….but the 9-me-bc seems to be helping with the anedonia….its not a high, and doesn’t even feel stimulating.

But the anhedonia is improving, getting out of bed is Easier, less cravings for substances too, so it’s easier to stay off the meds (unless work/ life gets too hectic)",1700848141,kal8uni,t3_181ulzm,t1_kak7bjm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
PA99,"I actually intentionally ingested ¼ of a Zoloft after ingesting a low dose of harmine (crudely extracted from rue). There is, indeed, a reaction with this combo, similar to MDMA (incl. slight increase in heart rate) but it didn't last long. This is interesting, as Zoloft, on it's own, has little to no immediate effect. I also (stupidly) combined a low dose of harmine with over 100 mg of Lexapro, but didn't get any effect. I've noticed a faint effect from Zoloft, by itself, so perhaps the reason it synergized with harmine is because it's also a mild serotonin releaser.",1700953781,karfs3n,t3_181ulzm,t1_kardi60,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
