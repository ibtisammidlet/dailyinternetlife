Efik_Pail,"Hello,
You should not have any rebound with Agmatine.
But if you are scared about it (better be cautious when you get rid off Benzos), you can reduce your dosage gradually. (From 1g to 500 for example)

Upset_Scientist3994,"About benzo withdrawal.... luckily not done that myself, but one friend of mine who had fierce history on all sorts of illegal drugs after quitting them all said that they make the worst ones, and especially mentally more difficult than heroin. Benzo withdrawal may have not same intensety as they leave your system over very very long period, but then this mental dysforia just never ever seem to end. Short term strong withdrawal may be very physical with adrenaline storms and stuff like that typical for gaba-ergic drugs.",1701782622,kc3a69i,t3_181ij0z,t1_kafh1ez,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,">No issues coming off benzos ? If so very lucky

Yeah, hahaha 😁

>Mostly bad insomnia , anxiety restlessness ect

Ah, could it be that I already had a gabaergic dysfunction, which my body tried to counter balance over the years. Which makes it so that gabaergics restore a balance but withdrawal doesn't happen because my system is already quite immune to it?

Thats what I feel like it might be. 

>bad insomnia , anxiety restlessness

Had that since childhood, 25 now. Anxiety I feel like I desensitized to when i was 16-18. Restlessness, mainly physical, is just my personality. Bad insomnia only got better since a year or so. Tried (imo) enough benzos that I should experience some withdrawel the past half year, but no none",1700747677,kafsfnr,t3_181ij0z,t1_kafhmpx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Ohh, maybe I'm immune for withdrawal because I have introspective issues. I have a hard time distinguishing if its anxiety/adreneline or if its some other feeling that I didn't filter out",1701885330,kc9673w,t3_181ij0z,t1_kc3a69i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
