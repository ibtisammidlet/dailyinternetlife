Been using daily Agmatine to taper pregabolin and now benzos . 

Nearly off benzos and will continue Agmatine for post taper .

Question is , will stopping Agmatine cause an upregulation of NMDA receptors and rebound glutamate surges ?

Canâ€™t find any solid info online . 

Thanks",False,t5_4aoxhu,Agmatine nmda,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/181ij0z/agmatine_nmda/
