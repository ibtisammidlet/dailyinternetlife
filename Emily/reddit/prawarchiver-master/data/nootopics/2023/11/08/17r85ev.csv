skytouching,"That’s definitely an up to you thing. I’ve taken mirtazapine acutely concurrently with bromantane and semax and was okay but everyone is different.
The one thing about any unfamiliar substance is that too low of a dose is usually a good first dose.
When I started bromantane I was taking 100-200 mg a day but now I take about 35 mg it’s prescribed or starts at 25 in Eastern Europe iirc.
And I’d start with one spray I’m not sure the dosage but that’s low as you can go.
And I’d at least wait a couple hours if not try them all separately to see how they each affect you also just to experience the substance on its own.
Most people might think that’s too cautious or would do it differently but worst case is you don’t notice anything this way and can up the dose later but if you over do it it could be really unpleasant. Probably not but you never know at first.",1699536131,k8hxjeg,t3_17r85ev,t3_17r85ev,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

entavias,"Agreed, try separately one squirt of each try together one squirt of each, take it slow. Both came be great but too much messing with neurochemistry can backfire and make a good thing bad. I hope they help! Semax definitely helped me kickstart some good habits when I tried it",1699607438,k8mhz22,t3_17r85ev,t1_k8hxjeg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Scary_Amoeba_9615,Honestly I didn’t find any relief from anxiety from the salenk. Bromantane does to have a mild psycho stimulant effect.,1702177389,kcpzdxu,t3_17r85ev,t1_kc52p9r,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
