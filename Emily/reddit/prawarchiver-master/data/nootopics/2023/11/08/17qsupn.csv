neboglamine,"4ClModafinil is very effective ime however, do get some extreme tiredness 8 hours after dosing.
Haven't experienced this with 4FlModafinil.",1699477397,k8erww2,t3_17qsupn,t3_17qsupn,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
ReadingImpressive554,"I bought 4cl yesterday, but after watching a video on YouTube about Modafinil analogues, emphasizing that 4cl was the best, one fact emerged that 4cl-amphetamine is extremely toxic (at very large doses it must also be said) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Chloroamphetamine while the 3cl no, it is a curiosity that does not have to be similar to this one, since there are many widely used drugs that have it, but in the absence of studies, there is the doubt that it could be harmful in the medium long term.

It would be good to know experiences about continued use, specifically I am looking for something to use 5 days a week, the obvious thing is to choose modafinil, but at first it seems very expensive to buy it in Europe so I looked for an alternative.",1699479108,k8ewpvl,t3_17qsupn,t3_17qsupn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"I’m not totally sure that that would really translate from amphetamine to afinil. Amphetamine in therapeutic doses is referred to as safe and methamphetamine is supposed to be inherently neurotoxic. But there are a lot of other factors that relate to the initial amphetamine or analog being being safe but metabolites being neurotoxic and though I’m not familiar with 4/3clamphetamine iirc it was specific to the pharmacology. I’m not saying you’re wrong I’m just saying that I’d shy away from making any assumptions of two very different substances based on chemical structures.
That said I have no idea but I’d be mindful of my liver and take harm reduction supplements regardless.",1699537438,k8i0dpm,t3_17qsupn,t1_k8ewpvl,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
