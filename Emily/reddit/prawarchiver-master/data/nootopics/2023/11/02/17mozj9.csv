Since my first post about the whole ShipBob thing in early August, it's been three months. Up to date they're still holding 70% of our nootropics hostage at their facilities. I see no other way but to post this video message in hope to get support from nootropic enthusiasts. Thank you for watching and sharing your thoughts!",1698994050,k7mbke7,t3_17mozj9,t3_17mozj9,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
jayT1212,"Send a firm, straightforward demand letter from a reputable law firm demanding they release your items immediately. Do not rely on them for any service, and offer to send your own representatives to pick, pack and ship your items to your new warehouse right away. Disgusting what they’re doing to you guys.",1699009797,k7mvgzb,t3_17mozj9,t3_17mozj9,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

barrettshepherdsimpl,"I'm so sorry y'all are going through this! It's insane a 3PL partner of 5+ years would randomly terminate the agreement and make it your issue to solve. It's very weird that they won't release inventory. We've had clients who came to us from SB who had poor experiences, and I will say that a lot of the time, the issue can be that since ShipBob is mainly a network of 3PLs and doesn't own/operate most facilities, it's hard for them to get answers or solve issues. Hopefully, they're able to resolve this quickly, given that the products are perishable!",1701455205,kbkvbxy,t3_17mozj9,t3_17mozj9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
gitfetchmorecoffee,"What happened when you attempted to have them picked up at their facility? It seems strange they would not allow you to pick up your own stock(including an approved third party carrier), especially after they asked you to gather them and will not send them out. I would file lawsuit right away, legal departments usually do a good job of getting things moving. Let them know of your intention to file, and see if it atleast provokes some answers. Their behavior is strange. I hope they aren't hiding something like they have forfeited all ""non fda compliant"" product to the fda - or destroyed them because they thought it somehow was against their own contractual terms of service - and now they realize they may have erroneously jumped the gun.",1699005317,k7mp2eu,t3_17mozj9,t1_k7mbke7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

At this point we really intend to work with a competent law firm.

112358134,"There were several attempts to pick up pallets with our products from two different ShipBob warehouses. They informed us that it would be extremely helpful if the carrier could book the pick-up time at Open Dock software that ShipBob uses. But since the carrier doesn't use this particular software, we informed them in advance that it would be difficult to do that. Still ShipBob representative Mr. Ritesh Bindra assured us that he would take care of it. We provided all the necessary details regarding the carrier. But in the end, all the pick-up attempts were simply rejected by ShipBob upon arrival at their gate.",1699015782,k7n6mqb,t3_17mozj9,t1_k7mp2eu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
barrettshepherdsimpl,I’m sorry that all happened but I’m glad it’s been released and you’re able to somewhat stop the bleeding. I wish y’all a quick turnaround and hopefully much better success with your new 3PL partner!,1701868420,kc81202,t3_17mozj9,t1_kc7d90e,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
