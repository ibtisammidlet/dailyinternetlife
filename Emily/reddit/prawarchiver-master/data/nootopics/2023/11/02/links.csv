Im trying to treat the heavy symptoms of my depression and social anxiety including no drive, energy, motivation, no appetite, very bad cognition ( a handful of friends already asked me if I have ADD). Well

Im treatment-resistant (at least from official requirements) after I tried about 15 different meds of all the possible different classes (except the stronger MAOIs, Ketamine, psychedelics) as well as 2 analytical depth-psychological and 1 cognitive-behavioral therapy without any success.

Well, only med working is the last one I was prescribed but as its Pregabalin I can't take it daily (because it won't work anymore after 2 days in a row for me and I don't want to become addicted and suffer withdrawals).

Not too much about this but rather about the trial of my actual stack:

* **ALCAR** 2,000mg
* **Gotu Kola** 1,500mg (extract = 9000mg Gotu Kola, of which 15mg asiaticosides & 88mg L-Leucin)
* **Bacopa** 320mg (Doctor's Best ""Synapsa"" extract of which 55% so 176mg bacosides)
* **L-Citrulline** 6,000mg (Malate 2:1)
* **Inositol** 14,000-20,000mg
* **Omega 3 Fish Oil** 4,000mg (of which 720mg EPA & 480mg DHA)
* **Black Seed Oil** 3 teaspoons or 1 tablespoon
* **Multivitamin Complex** (+ 30 active ingredients, lactobacillus, acidophilus, COQ10, lycopene, quercitine etc.)

To this I use **Kratom** if needed (but really mostly daily the last month) of 500mg each dose, which might end at a maximum total of 5g per day - but definitely have to quit using it as a daily thing for sure. And **Pregabalin (Lyrica)** prescribed if needed which I originally limited to 2-3x/week but now take 4x/week with 3 days off.

I never tried the total stack in combination with my Pregabalin because I was worried about possible interactions that might be unhealthy, especially concerned about Inositol and Black Seed Oil with Pregabalin because of the GABA affinity. Might there be a reason to not take these together?

The ALCAR, Gotu Kola, Bacopa, fish oil and vitamins weren't any issue with Pregabalin as well as with Kratom.

What do you think about this stack for depression, social anxiety, ADD symptoms, low drive/energy/motivation? Let me know about any other suggestions or assumptions.

I'm addicted to nicotine chewing gum, I take too much and it's bad for my stomach. Do you have any advice on how to stop and replace it with something else that provides dopamine? I do sport, I eat a balanced diet, I sleep early but as I took abilify for 2 years, I feel a certain lack of dopamine, of motivation and nicotine helps me but I have to stop because I take far too many chewing gums.
