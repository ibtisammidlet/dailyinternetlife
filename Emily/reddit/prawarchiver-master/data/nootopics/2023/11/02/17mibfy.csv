Black_Cat_Fujita,"Does it really affect dopamine? Anyway, look into cytisine. Itâ€™s a partial agonist of the nicotinic receptors. Used for quitting smoking.

TQ_Piotr,"When he talks about this he is talking about vaping nicotine. Nicotine in other forms provides a more consistent flow of nicotine, not spiking levels by so much. What the other guy is saying is good stuff tho and really works",1698980631,k7lps9w,t3_17mibfy,t1_k7lgw2r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
