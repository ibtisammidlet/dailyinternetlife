ODEexperience,That has side effects. Some guys at longecity have tried that. Sublingually works but you would need more for the same effects.,1699173322,k7wj4kf,t3_17nu8n0,t3_17nu8n0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Alksfrench,"Small update : It made me lazy all day, 12h later i feel it working well finally ! No issue so far, i knew that it could give brain fog and stuff like that sometimes, i will dose lower tomorrow. I'm pleased with the effect, verbal fluency is great (while i usually struggle with part when i'm sleep deprivated like now), recall is faster than during the last days. I'll see how i feel after a good night of sleep. 

No issue with the nasal administration.",1699403491,k8aif2e,t3_17nu8n0,t1_k85r730,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
