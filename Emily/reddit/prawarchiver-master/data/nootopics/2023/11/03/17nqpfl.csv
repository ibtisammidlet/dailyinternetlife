UNAcceptable_Value,"Gave you my best options already, take action bro, aside from everything i suggested, clamastine furamate for autophagy and remyelination",1699133332,k7ud0r4,t3_17nqpfl,t3_17nqpfl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Hmm.. I thought autophagy is more important to increase when you are generally in high age, and lot of so called anti-aging supplements are working that way. 

I never ever heard before of increasing autophagy for neurological unbalance. 

Or mayby the urge of so many people to self-medicate such issues with ethanol could be aimed for that purpose since as a solvent it promotes neurological autophagy. 

Remyelination with my primitive knowledge is good if there is de-myelination for some reason or another, but psyche med damage is imbalance in neurotransmittery systems what is software and not hardware like myeline is. 

But of course generally in this situation anything what is strongly neurogenetic ougth to  help and then remyelination goes in same package regardless it may not be the center of problem here.",1699213298,k7yx0jg,t3_17nqpfl,t1_k7ud0r4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
UNAcceptable_Value,"Autophagy is recycling of damaged cells, and psychiatric drugs harm is nothing else than a neurotoxic injury with auto immune features, similar ofren worst of what MS does",1699214045,k7yz2lc,t3_17nqpfl,t1_k7yx0jg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"This should apply only with stimulant substances such as ADHD meds, what burn things out in nervous system. Neurolept style psychiatric medicine does not make neurotoxic injuries by burning things out, but rather just doint the opposite, paralysing them of zombiefing them by blocking dopamine input. Inbalance out of that may linger then on for a long time, and can turn in reverse once there starts to come increase when medicine is wearing off, but your nerves cannot receive it (same things happen during springtimes here after winter darkness when there is also similar spike in suicide rates than in darkening late autumns). 

I though dont know to which extent Abilify / Aripiprazole is stimulant or neurolept, but those symptoms sound pretty neuroleptic to me. Or something more similar to SSRI aftereffects, what neither is neurotoxic injury in material hardware tissues of nerves, but neurotransmittery / hormonal / possibly epigenetic imbalance what is still not understood properly. 

Autophagy combined then neurogenetics, remyelination co-factors & all that stuff where neural tissue grows out such as fish oil, quality choline so on could make sense on post-amphetaminic or similar problems, or post-alcholism treatment to me.",1699302951,k849wa7,t3_17nqpfl,t1_k7yz2lc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
