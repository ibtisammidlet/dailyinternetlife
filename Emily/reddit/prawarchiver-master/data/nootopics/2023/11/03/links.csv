This is my strategy and projection for how I'm going to try and live my life for the next couple of months at least. So, to start off I am not the stereotypical dumb person. I've tested my IQ online several times with the CAIT v2, 1980s SAT, and the Ravens (although this one I only did the progressive matrices part or whatever its called). These are all relatively g-loaded tests of cognitive ability however they can't decipher how a person will function in life because they are not applicable to our function as a human interacting with the world around us. 

My scores for mathematical IQ range from 111 on the 1980s SAT M, 119 PRI and 127 VSI on the CAIT and around 127 on the Ravens Progressive Matrices which makes sense because I've always been in the top of my math classes in primary school without studying much and only started to struggle once I got to geometry because I never studied and couldn't just figure it out in my head naturally. So I can grasp math concepts quicker than the average person but not as fast as someone with my IQ should be able to which doesn't make sense at surface level. This is where I believe my language and memory shortcomings start to hinder my quantitative/math ability and my general higher order cognition. I struggle to remember many things in life (not basic information like my name or my address but things that I've done, conversations, smaller details of my experiences which I generally don't pay attention to either, details in other people's lives that are relevant in everyday conversation/thought and just have a shit memory in general for everything basically). If you asked me questions about myself it would be hard to get more than a sentence or two out without me having to think about it for a bit. This sucks when trying to form connections and have conversations with people. 

My VCI has varied from 86 on the CAIT 2.0 (which i think is unreliable because how would I ever do well on the general knowledge subtest when I have one of the worst memories of anyone I can think of) to 103 on the 1980s SAT verbal part. I took the verbal part of the CAIT about a month after my first test because I couldn't believe that my quantitative and verbal intelligence were more than 2 standard deviations apart and got a flat 100 upon retesting. This was much more believable and on par with my SAT score. I've always struggled with reading and most things with language tied to it ever since I was a child. I was sent into an ESL class when I was 5 because I didn't understand English but supposedly had no issues up until then with speaking or language in my native language according to my mother and had no formal diagnoses of any disorders. I took these speech classes up until second grade when I graduated out of it before almost any of the other ESL students. This would give anyone the idea that I was smart because I learned the language quicker than other students in my class however I would still struggle up until 6th grade with reading writing at least grade wise. I got to a normal grade range around middle school and even got a couple remarks about being good at writing essays throughout high school. This made me think that the only thing I had was ADHD and I struggled to focus as I would always get in trouble for being a class clown and being extremely talkative and disruptive to my classes. Further, ever since kindergarten I would get easily distracted, had a short attention span and would constantly be distracting other class mates so I know I for sure have ADHD. I'm medicated now although only started taking Adderall in college after realizing how big of a problem I had in daily function and realizing it wouldn't go away by becoming an adult (a lot of people think that kid's mental disorders go away in adulthood for some reason which is really fucked up and dangerous for the kids like me who don't receive treatment to fix their neurological problems in childhood and have to deal with the consequences in adulthood.) 

My Cognitive Proficiency  Index on the CAIT was 127 (based off of Digit Span and Symbol Search subtests). This doesn't make sense because I feel like my working memory is horrible and my processing speed as well but maybe this means my memory is fine but my comprehension is bad which would indicate I am borderline level language wise and don't understand half the information that I process? I don't understand how I can have such a high memory score yet struggle with recalling information at the degree I do, it makes zero sense to me.

All this leads me down to the fact that I have a language disorder, possibly Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder along with my autism and adhd which aren't helping my case. I have not been formally diagnosed with any of these disorders fwiw.

My protocol to improve my fluid verbal/language based reasoning is:

Cardio (30 mins minimum daily, Zone 2): Improves hippocampal function while also increasing the size of the hippocampus and changing the structure of it. This is in hopes to add room for verbal crystallized intelligence. I also take Adderall, piracetam and vinpocetine which have side effects and you probably shouldn't engage in exercise while on Adderall but I really could care less at this point, at the moment i'm taking anything that helps improve my performance, ill worry about the risks later on

Meditation: Increases size of hippocampus and supposedly increases working memory through structural changes

Dual-N-Back: 20 sessions a day minimum: has been shown in studies to increase verbal working memory and working memory in general; also increases functional connectivity in the default mode network which correlates with improved working memory.

Reading: in effort to improve reading comprehension and anything associated with speech and thought. Also going to have a dictionary on hand to look up any words I don't know and to help if I can't comprehend the context of a sentence I'm reading. Also, this will hopefully increase my active vocabulary and thought speed/accuracy in describing my thoughts in words.

Relational Frame Training / Syllogimous v3: This is studied to increase fluid intelligence and reasoning abilities associated with language and cognition/thought in children through development. Hasn't been studied as much in adults but there is a high probability it can increase intelligence to a smaller degree.

Juggling: has been shown to increase grey matter in the brain, perception, and specifically hand-eye co-ordination and balance. Through this, the brain's processing speed can be increased sufficiently. Has also been shown to improve left-right hemisphere connectivity.

Nootropics: racetams, tak-653 (anecdotes proposing that it improves iq scores slightly and I can affirm it deepens some of my thoughts on it but this can just be placebo), bacopa monnieri, creatine, lions mane, vinpocetine, cerebrolysin, omega 3 (dha, epa); can boost neurotransmitters and cell function to a certain level improving brain function and intelligence a tiny bit through certain mechanism of actions although these changes aren't permanent and these are acute solutions. Nobody should rely on these solely if they are struggling with intellectual/learning disabilities

Can anyone offer any insight on what condition/problem I might have? I would really appreciate it as I don't really have anyone to vent to and don't trust many people in my life to talk about this. I need some advice on how to deal with my situation because I feel like I am in an impossible situation where I smart but dumb at the same time, so there is such duality in my experience as a supposed ""intellectual"" person.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Get Smart or Die Trying (Protocol for cognitive enhancement),https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17ndo8n/get_smart_or_die_trying_protocol_for_cognitive/

This subreddit aswell as the “other” has helped me find a genuine interest in research chemicals, biology and self improvement. I’m young, so it’s very nice to know these things now, I feel blessed to have come across the two Nootropic subreddits so early in my life, let alone at all. I’ve found so many interesting things and so much information that is possibly able to help me. These subreddits are truly a service to people and provoke fascinating topics to be spoken about. Special shoutout to u/sirsadalot, I appreciate your work, giving actual sound advice with evidence and logic to back your claims. That can sometimes be a rarity.
