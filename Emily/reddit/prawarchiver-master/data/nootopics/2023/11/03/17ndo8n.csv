,"A suggestion: if you are learning juggling just for the sake of improvement learn something you want instead. It's benefits are coming from new motor skill learning, fine tuning of hand eye coordination etc. A martial art, sport or musical instrument can provide same benefits. Martial art or sport can have the added benefit of extra cardio as well. If you like juggling ignore what I said and go for it. I just find learning something for the sake of its benefits, makes me unmotivated so I stop doing it in long term.

Similar to my brain, after trying a lot of risky nootropics, my brain is less resilient to stress. I recommend people just stick to prescription drugs and taking care of themselves.

Acceptable_Cheek_727,"Since you are fairly new to adderall and judging from the paragraphs you’re writing you probably do not need to be taking as much as you are… if you become accustomed to the euphoria you’ll eventually have to dose more so just be responsible and avoid the temptation to redose. The half-life is ridiculously long, leading me to strongly suspect long-term adderall use causes sleep-impairments resulting in neurodegeneration reduced working memory/general cognitive function, attention issues, and basically all the symtoms of ADHD. People with ADHD unless receiving adderall treatment have “attention” issues becuase they can’t focus without their meds because they develop dependence. They have poor working memories becuase adderall causes working memory impairments (espcially if you’re already an anxious person). People with ADHD often have trouble eating on their meds causing them to lose weight which reduces testosterone thereby reducing motivation, cognitive function, confidence. Adderall can cause gyno so I suspect it effects hormone profile negatively. It reduces your ability to solve complex problems but makes you more confident in your abilities while on it giving you a false sense of confidence/ability. It causes additional strain on your heart which is no good. Vasoconstriction reducing nutrients to the brain. 

All I’m saying is if you’re looking to optimize your cognitive function to the utmost possible adderall isn’t going to be apart of that equation. 

Meditating on adderall is ass. 

Working out on adderall is potentially dangerous. 

I have used this substance since I was 16 on and off up until now (22). It’s not a net positive. You’re better off without it. I often cycle off for several months at a time. 

People will do anything to justify their addiction/dependence/infatuation with a drug, especially adderall. 

I know it feels like it’s a wonder drug but it’s not. Anyways if you’re going to continue using it here are my recommendations. 

These are extremely neuroprotective against any adderall-induced neurotoxicity and heart remodeling that may or may not occur: 
ALCAR 
ALA 
Taurine 
ECGC 
L-citruline
Selenium 
Vitamin D3/K2 
I recommend a multivitamin if food is an issue. Performance lab multi is fantastic 
Cognance 
Magnesium L-threonate 
Saffron 

If you’re curious about any MoA/justification lmk I’ll provide research articles I’ve poured over hours and hours of research regarding this issue over the course of several years.

CryptoEscape,"I actually remember being on Adderall, and it did interfere with my sleep, and after about 5 days of taking it I would wake up exhausted and my body just begging for a day off (which I usually gave it.)

The temptation to chase the euphoria was difficult some days, but eventually euphoria was mostly gone unless I took a higher dose.

Unfortunately I also have severe ADHD….since childhood too ….couldn’t even follow basic directions from the teacher, while every other child did.  Despite the ADHD I’m actually intelligent.

Adderall was a wonder drug at first, transformed my life, ADHD eliminated, but over time the side effects got worse, and the beneficial effects got less

I took a three year break but my life was falling apart unmedicated (despite doing everything else right..,,eg sleep exercise, diet, hydration, etc)

Now I’m on Dex-Methylphenidate…..it wears off surprisingly fast.  I can usually sleep just four hours after my last dose.  (I work second shift and regularly dose very late.)

It’s ~80% as effective as Adderall, but for the reduced side effects it’s worth it.

Still though, it causes a mood roller coaster throughout the day.

I’ve tried all kinds of nootropics to get off it, probably spent over $3,000, and some help, but not nearly enough.

For now I’ve just accepted I need the medication.  Part of me still hopes to find the perfect nootropic, but I doubt it.

I do take a multivitamin, choline, sulforaphane and omega 3s to help my brain recover from all the stress adderall can put it through. However I don’t feel that it is as problematic as you think at a low dose. Obviously, it’s only been 2 months of semi-consistent use and it is by no means a wonder drug in my experience but I don’t think it will have long lasting effects if you take the right stuff to counter it. I also take vinpocetine, a vasodilator to prevent vasoconstriction a bit and exercise almost daily to help blood flow. I feel like it is genuinely a wonder drug for people that struggle with task initiation like me even though it does apparently slightly reduce cognitive ability while on it.
