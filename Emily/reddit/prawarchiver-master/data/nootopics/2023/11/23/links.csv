Hi there,

Cholecystokinin Antagonists have been researched for their potential to treating Depression, Anxiety and Pain. Unfortunately, as far as I know there is no substance that is easily accessible.

Maybe even a herb that acts as a Cholecystokinin Antagonist?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Does Anyone Know of a Substance That Acts as a Cholecystokinin Antagonist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1825s2r/does_anyone_know_of_a_substance_that_acts_as_a/
