Upset_Scientist3994,"I have some memory that Gotu Kola partially goes into there, although not sure if it is agonist or antagonist or something else. And on top of that it lifts up rest of neurotransmitters, neurogenesis, and especially GABA rather well what also works into same direction. 

At least that should be commonly accessible. For me it seemed to have some minor anti-anxiety effect if you want to get out from stronger anxiolytics. May though work unpredictable way on metabolism of other substances so remember that if you take very strong medicines along with that. 

I always wondered why even in India it is very little there even though it grows wild and is easily availible for producers, and when this Bacopa Monnieri is called 'Brahmi' then Gotu Kola is often mentioned under same name due to somewhat similar effects it produces. Of course then it gets undernoticed when Bacopa is anyway much more popular also in there.",1700827818,kak255q,t3_1825s2r,t3_1825s2r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Wellyeahso,"Got Kola is the only thing I came across that is natural, but I never found any deeper information about if it affects CCKa or CCKb more or less, dosages, etc.

This wiki article lists a number of research drugs that act on CCK: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystokinin_antagonist
