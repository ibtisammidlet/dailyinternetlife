I would love to try some or the stuff suggested but I am on a Buvidal injection (buprenorphine depo) which is essentially a blocker on my opiod receptors. For this reason I feel I would be wasting my money. I have already started dropping down to quit and should be off in the next month but it lingers up, sometimes 9-12 month in the system. 

I can't even get runners high, I just want to feel joy and motivation again! 

Would I be better off just sitting it out until it has left my system? 

Can anybody shed some light on this? 

Also could anybody recommend anything to stay in deep sleep?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Anhedonia, fatigue and depression + buprenorphine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17y1sh9/anhedonia_fatigue_and_depression_buprenorphine/

First thing i realised after some time was that i needed to eliminate Gluten from my diet, 100%.
Even a small amount = hello bad depression.

In terms of medicines, the one thing i hadnt tried were the old Irreversible MAOIS.
Problem is, in my country, they cost at least £1,000 per month!

So i had to dig hard to find repiable & more affordable option online.

Pglchem stocks Phenelzine, but i preferred to leave that (at least as a first option) because many many people say the side effects are harsh: sexual dysfunction, diminished cognition - no likely due to its side effect of raising GABA across the whole brain.
Ps. It gradually causes a functional Vitamin B6 deficiency and has potential hepatotoxic effects.

So i thought Tranylcypromine (essentially a ‘pure’ blocker of both MAO-A and MAO-B) was a better option.

Most reliable source i found (thx to some help from other users here) was “onlinegenericmedicine.com”.
Works a miracle.
