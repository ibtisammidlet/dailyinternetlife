Reasonable_Dot_1831,"Try emoxypine, it's an underdog in the nootropics space.  

Search for reports here on reddit, there are not so many, but everyone is very positive.

I get energy from it, it lowers my anxiety and gives me good mood. But there are no (Known) sideffects and you cannot get addicted to it.

It's a strong antioxidant and a vitamin B6 analoge.",1700304968,k9r3mv2,t3_17y1sh9,t3_17y1sh9,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
heyjude900,"I'm on Sublocade and use many nootropics that don't interfere. The biggest two that have helped me are Sarcosine and Saffron. I can also take both of those while also on antidepressants too. They have helped me quite a bit! They are a bit ""lesser"" of nootropics and a good place to start, I think. Don't expect a miraculous transition, like how we feel on opiates, but it's definitely worth it for me!

Edit: I also second a sleep study. I have central apneas from buprenorphine and those can be detrimental in the long run if not addressed. I'm using a cpap, and because of how I feel (fatigued), put me on Modafanil, which gave me a tad more motivation.",1700329231,k9scu8m,t3_17y1sh9,t3_17y1sh9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

lambjenkemead,"The thing that will work best for this BY Far is Low Dose Naltrexone. It partially antagonizes the opiate receptors and then your body responds by producing a cascade of natural endorphins. It‚Äôs non addictive and can completely eradicate OAWS symptoms in many. 

You can get relatively cheap in the US through agelessrx.com

I‚Äôve seen many people struggling for months with these symptoms have them gone in a week

One caveat is you need to be off all opioids including things like kratom for at least a week or more for it to work",1700400436,k9vxym1,t3_17y1sh9,t3_17y1sh9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Accurate_Tough8382,"I take suboxone and have had no problems with any nootropics not working.
Here is what I take on a daily basis. And I am going to put everything I take, even other daily meds and I take some peptides too.

„ÄãMorning„Ää
‚òÜSabroxy- this is my absolute favorite. It helps my vyvanse last longer. 
‚òÜDynamomine
‚òÜCortagen-occasionally but will be trying Cerebrolysin next
‚òÜVyvanse
‚òÜN-Acetyl Carnitine 
‚òÜBromantane 
‚òÜ Tyrosine but about to try N-Acetyl Tyrosine instead
‚òÜOxytocin- occasionally 
‚óèAniracetam 
‚óèNoopept nasal spray 
‚óèOxiracetam 
‚óèThe last 3 I have just started, so I will switch out. First tried Noopept and awesome the first 3 days. Then, it will still make me feel better, but no extra feelings of any sort. So then I started Aniracetam, and that helps with energy way better. Sometimes, I take them both, but I'm currently out of Noopept. I have not taken Oxiracetam yet. Just got the bottle.
‚òÜBirth control
‚òÜA piece of suboxone- I get 8mg films. I tear off like 1/4 of it

„ÄãEvenings„Ää
‚òÜDextroamphetamine 
‚òÜ sabroxy if I'm sleepy and my stimulants aren't working well. 
‚òÜAnother 1/4 of Suboxone

Lndscpegrdnr,"Same.

The first time I got off bup I felt like shit for months. I'm on it again now and want to be off of it. Over 3 years into recovery but after the first 15 months I still felt like absolute shit, tired, fatigued, depression, no motivation, anhedonia, lethargy. My counselor suggested I get back on bup so I did and it helped a ton. 

I just did an overnight sleep study and found I have sleep apnea (obstructive I'm pretty sure). One thing to be aware of is that opioids can cause central brain sleep apnea. If you're waking up tired and feel tired and fatigued all day that MAY be the issue. 

I just started armodafinil for the sleep apnea so I'm using this opportunity to decrease and try to get off of bup.",1700323445,k9rzcxj,t3_17y1sh9,t3_17y1sh9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

If you don't mind me asking what dose of bupe have you been put on to feel this way? I was put onto 16mg from a mild addiction and have always felt over medicated. When requesting to be put down I was put on the buvidal shot 128mg which is equivalent to 16mg a day due to bioavailability.
