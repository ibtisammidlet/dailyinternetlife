qdouble,Just because it operates on different receptors than other stimulants does that actually mean that its effects feel different or better than other stimulants?,1699806679,k8xzma8,t3_17th7xa,t3_17th7xa,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Yes this is a shame. Someone should make non-toxic analogs of arecoline. Would be interesting to see how it is as a noot,1699823155,k8z8i7q,t3_17th7xa,t3_17th7xa,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
BroScienceAlchemist,"> Among the four major alkaloids, arecoline is the primary alkaloid in AN. It regulates a group of cellular enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and lysyl oxidase, and inhibits p53 mRNA expression and DNA repair mechanisms [36,37,38]. The contribution of other alkaloids is not well known; however, they can induce alterations in the macromolecules of mammalian cells [37]. In addition, in an AN consumer, these alkaloids undergo nitrosation in the oral cavity to generate AN-derived nitrosamines (N-nitrosoguvacine, 3-methylnitrosaminopropionitrile, and N-nitrosoguvacoline) to damage DNA [39,40,41]. Furthermore, Arecaidine and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) interacted synergistically to induce tumorigenesis in the buccal pouch of hamsters [42]. Another study demonstrated that 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) and arecoline induce OC in C57BL/6JNarl mice [14,43].

Leaning toward no, as arecoline itself is a cytotoxic genotoxic mutagen. 

Downregulating expression of DNA repair and impairing anti-oxidant, glutathione synthesis is a fatal combo.",1699804386,k8xtsph,t3_17th7xa,t3_17th7xa,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
