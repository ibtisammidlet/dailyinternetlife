You can actually have some freedom of speech here to discuss potential new avenues for boosting brain-power whilst mitigating any potential harm, without your post getting automatically removed or even randomly banned.

The latest thing that really caught my eye is the natural substance: Areca Nut. This is potentially a very unique type of stimulant/brain booster owing to its effects that differ from most others (eg. positive effects on certain types of Muscarinic Receptors \[the sister version of the Nicotinic Receptor\]).

That said, at the moment, this product is 100% a no-go zone as there are numerous studies which document that, like Tobacco, it contains hundreds of toxins and carcinogens. You can't chew it, you can't swallow it - either way you're amplifying the risk of getting cancer exponentially.

Here's the part that disappoints me the most: the active chemical in Areca Nut that supposedly is responsible for its positive effects on the brain is 'Arecoline' (though I'm sure there are a few others that also contribute). **Unlike Nicotine (the active chemical in Tobacco), which according to research does not actually pose any health risks like cancer all by itself, Arecoline on the other hand research suggests DOES actually cause harm, even in isolation.**

So far, a review study released this year suggests the best possible measures (so far) to minimize these devastating adverse effects is: concurrent usage of Antioxidants (easily available) as well as certain Anti-Inflammatory meds (not-so-easily available):
