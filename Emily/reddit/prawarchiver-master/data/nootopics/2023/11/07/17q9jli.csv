gnootynoots26,"Fasoracetam is my favorite daily racetam. Great for improving all aspects of executive functioning. It also has a pro social feeling to it which I enjoy a lot. Pramiracetam is great for improving processing speed and working memory. I find it easier to stay on task and work on what I objectively know I should be working on. It unfortunately does induce the Spock effect, making it bad for socializing. Phenylpiracetam is like the Modafinil of racetams. It‚Äôs motivating, stimulating and great for socializing. It only seems to work well for me when I take it on occasion though.",1699451424,k8ctug8,t3_17q9jli,t3_17q9jli,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
OneIndependence4708,"I've tried a couple. 

Noopept 

Coluracetam 

Pramiracetam 

Phenylpiracetam

Aniracetam

Oxiracetam

Out of those I'd say my top 3 are (in no particular order) 

Noopept,
Phenylpiracetam,
Aniracetam

Noopept is super good for motivation. I love taking it especially to workout with. I notice I can hit higher weight and for more reps like I'm more motivated and I have more mental stamina. I max out at about 10mg with noopept though if I take more I seem to get very irritable and I get quite the racetam headache. So it's definitely important to take Alpha-GPC or another choline supplement with it and all the rest of these. 

Phenylpiracetam is great but most people say you can build a tolerance to it so I only take it on busy days at work or days when I'm pretty sleep deprived. It's pretty stimulating and the focus and clear mindedness is pretty nice. 

Aniracetam is a recent one for me. It seems to be a bit different from the other ones in that it's more anxiolytic. It gives a pretty smooth focus and I've noticed it really enhances music for me. It feels good to just sit back and enjoy some music while working with it.

I will say I've noticed a lot of mental clarity and cognitive improvement from Cerebrolysin. However, I know that's a big step from taking a pill and instead injecting yourself with several MLs of pig brain. I take about 5ml weekly and have been for the last 3 weeks and I will say the metal clarity and focus I have from that has been really good. I'm sure you can get similar effects from other things that increase BDNF and GNF though as well like Lion's mane which I take pretty often and also Semax and Selank which I've experimented with as well. Semax has been one for me where I did notice a lot of mental clarity, motivation and deeper focus. It seems to actually last after using it for a while as well.",1699406296,k8ap85s,t3_17q9jli,t3_17q9jli,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

sadderall123,"I don't notice anything from noopept, but the source I got it from was shady so it's probably bunk. A lot of fake stuff out there.

What doses of Semax and Selank do you take? Intranasally? They seem pretty expensive, but I'd give em a try. There's like 8 variations of semax on sicence bio which just confuses me way more üòñ

I dunno what's going on with my brain, it's been so bad lately, I'm so mentally slow and in a haze. I'm just going to stop taking all supplements I'm currently taking.

Upset_Scientist3994,"Coluracetam for tourism or leisure walking around or in forest.

Phenyl of course to maintain steady mind and nerves under heavy stress since it was precisely developed for that sort of thing, and was succesful. 

Fasoracetam is important for those who (ab)use gabaergic substances to maintain themselves not getting too tolerant / addicted to them, results may be mixed up so hard to say, but there is virtually not much anything else in this field in a way that it does not addict on its own. 

Like with other nootropics, it is best to create a stack of 2-3 of them in a way that they are slightly different and create synergy, and then vary those components for context-based needs. This is what many are doing, as then doses of individual components can be less and no single effect gets overhelming.",1699698420,k8rnw8u,t3_17q9jli,t1_k8b6zdu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

OneIndependence4708,"The noopept I have right now is from Pure Nootropics and I have it in the 20mg capsules. So I have to open each one and way out how much I want to take. I had bought it before I knew my brain could really only handle 10mg. Before that I was using Nootropics depot and their noopept was great, it came in 10mg capsules but it's been out of stock for a while. 

I got my Semax and Selank from Everychem.com those seem to be pretty high quality. I've only ever used the intranasal NA-Semax and NA-Selank. Which both seem to have less research on them but the N-Acytl addition to them is supposed to make them more bio available. 

Cosmic Nootropics is another great source they have Semax and Selank as well, but I've never tried theirs though but most of the stuff they have is actually used in Eastern Europe. That's where I've gotten my cerebrolysin, phenylpiracetam, Picamilon, SKQ1... Etc. 

If you do end up trying phenylpiracetam there's regular phenylpiracetam and there's phenylpiracetam HCL. Most people say the HCL version is not as potent so I would avoid that one. 

I have only gone through about 2g of coluracetam and that seems to be a racetam you stack with other ones I don't really notice anything significant by itself. I believe it increase the availability of choline in your brain which is beneficial for the other racetams to use. At least that's how I understand it, could be wrong. I've stacked it mostly with pramiracetam which I also got from everychem and that seemed to be pretty good. Kinda funny but I though you could take prami sublingually. Turns out it gives you some nice acid burns. So make sure you put in capsules if you every try it. That stack seemed pretty good it wasn't over stimulating and I just felt smooth and very focused. 

Everyone is different so you just have to find what works for you. There's the classic suggestions like sleep and a good diet. Those definitely are important to me. I typically fast until around 11-12pm I find that my mental clarity is a lot better if I don't eat or eat lower carbs for my first meal but that's just me could be different for you. 
You may want to go over everything that you're doing right now to find what's different and correct that. Maybe you were sick and still have some lingering symptoms, covid seems to do that. Recently I saw a post from a guy talking about long covid and everything happening from that. There are generally things that can help with that like NAC and other anti-oxidants. SKQ1 can be pretty niche, but that is also a very powerful mitochondrial-targeted anti-oxidant. I've read about people taking that intranasally and that helps clear their mind. Everychem has SKQ1 but you'd have to make it into a nasal spray if you were to use it as such. Cosmic Nootropics has SKQ1 but that's mostly just for skin care. I don't know too much about that and it's pretty niche so might want to start more generally and get more specified as you get more in touch with your brain/body. 

I saw one guy comment it was context dependent. I think I'd agree. But it definitely is fun to experiment and see what you like. Good luck on your journey :)",1699453672,k8cz3ch,t3_17q9jli,t1_k8bsvss,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Other way around. It increases GABA so may make pretty lethargic initially until your system adopts into it as rapdidly does. Suitable for studying as increases memory formation, and this GABA-thing allows you to sit in boring lectures for full days more easy while actually remembering what you heard there. 

Since Neboglamine and before that D-serine connected into same thing is widely discussed here in Nootopics, strange that Nefiracetam what is one of very few belonging into this class of things what effect also via Glycine/D-serine site of NMDA of modulating it somehow is never mentioned. This may be behind its most intresting effects. Also; there are complaints or mentions that Nefiracetam can create something of kidney pain or sensations what unlike web rumour out of badly interpreted research is, is probably from this aforomentioned things. Since there is research and anecdotes that D-serine also puts stress on kidneys what is strange but you can find it here on reddit. Nobody so far brought up the reason that this connection could be why Nefiracetam appears to do same thing - it mayby not direct toxcicity but some sort of neural tension what necessarely dont affect most of people but may be bad for some of them. Generally this very intresting and different racetam has received very little attention no matter its unique propensities could open door to understand lot of other things too.",1699698083,k8rngxl,t3_17q9jli,t1_k8pkjgr,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"Completely agree. The (theoretical) nephrotoxicity is why I dose intranasally although I have never encountered issues with kidney pain when dosing orally. If I recall correctly the toxicity was not observed in the clinical trials for Nefi in humans. I would say 10mg intranasally roughly equals 300-400mg oral, so it definitely pays off to dose this way. 

I found it slightly relaxing as well in accordance with its GABA-modulating effect. Nothing crazy though, I would compare the relaxation with that you would get from a beer. Of course Nefi is actually cognitively enhancing instead of impairing (alcohol), which is pretty unique for a GABA-ergic compound. Another plus is that there are no withdrawals commonly seen with GABA-ergic compounds. It pairs excellently with caffeine as well.

Neboglamine does have some similarities to Nefi (the MOA overlaps with one of the MOAs of Nefi), but I found Nefi to be far superior in its effects (and far more noticable). For me the effects of Nefi remind me of mild but perceptible dose of psilocybin, without the psychedelic headspace. Colors are brighter, mood is up and thoughts flow effortlessly. Truly an amazing compound, it would definitely not be misplaced on EveryChem.",1699707166,k8s0u8a,t3_17q9jli,t1_k8rngxl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"I have to retract my statements from previous posts. I came across a study in human volunteers indicating that the oral bioavailability of Nefi is very high. I have no idea why it felt stronger than oral in the first place, but I suspect placebo. Nefi is still one of the few compounds I take daily, but I now take anywhere from 25-100mg orally. 100mg brings on a pleasant sense of relaxation but it can make one a bit unproductive because of that. At low doses the NMDA-enhancing effects seem to dominate.

Regarding your question: nefi is not soluble in anything else that DMSO, PEG-400 or PG. I wouldn't use the latter two; DMSO in such low amounts as we use is perfectly safe. I still use it for dihexa which doesn't dissolve in anything at all except DMSO.",1708778215,krwtu8l,t3_17q9jli,t1_krwms67,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
