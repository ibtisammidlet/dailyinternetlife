I just ordered some from Australia, I’m not expecting a nootropic effect or a typical nootropic effect. But having just gone through a half sheet of really decent lsd microdosing recreational dosing and everything in between. I’ve been thinking about my next conquest and it popped up before I decided to drive down to Denver for some booms. I digress.

Iboga or ibogamine has fascinated me with its super complex pharmacology. 5ht2a, nmda, kor and more especially if there are other iboga alkaloids. Which honestly sounds personally like a recipe for a bad trip but I’ve read really compelling and some fantastical accounts of life changing experiences from depression to an an account of a heroin addict being relieved of physical opioid addiction. 

Long story short a very complex pharmacology on it’s own seems to have major potential. I plan on microdosing and most likely taking a dose for a real iboga experience.

If anyone wants to chime in with any thoughts about iboga or tabernathalog (iirc reading can be quite the psychoactive experience it self)
I’m open to any thoughts but I love talking pharmacology.

I do want to not before discussing that im not not naive enough to think the purchase might be bunk or lack luster.

Edit: ibogaine is the main alkaloid not ibogamine.
Also the alkaloids according to wiki are:

Ibogaine
Iboxygaine
Ibogaline
Alloibogaine
Catharanthine
Ibogamine
Noribogaine
Voacangine
Yohimbine
Hydroxyibogamine

Iirc most have unique pharmacological profiles.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Iboga extract,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17qjzo9/iboga_extract/

On the first day, I noticed being able to watch video lectures at faster speeds and manage to keep up. On day 2, I took 2mg and intense sleepiness was brought, but seemed to have improved reading speed by quite a margin; I took ~27 minutes on a reading comprehension set which usually takes 35~40min.
Its mood enhancing effects seemed greater than SSRI antidepressants until about this point too.

Every time I took this, the substance brought feelings of tiredness for 1.5~2 hours before fading out by itself. However, today I feel especially tired even 10 hours after taking it. Cognitive and mood benefits seemed to have largely abated at this point. 

Most reviews on TAK I read were centered on 2mg dose and reported consistent benefits.

However, I'm now worried about the possibility that ""honeymoon phase""of TAK has already ended for me. Also afraid to increase dose as it may bring even heavier drowsiness. Maybe I might skip dosing for tomorrow and see how it goes, I don't know.

I'd like to know if anyone has had similar experiences, and whether if TAK's positive effects could persist if I endure this initial phase.
Also, I'm curious if taking TAK at night could reduce sleepiness the following day while retaining cognitive benefits. I also take an SSRI which also makes me tired if taken at morning, but taking it right before sleep seems to counteract drowsiness the following day while retaining mood elevation. However, I'm unsure if same could be applied to TAK, as the mechanism of action is highly different. Though I read many anecdotes stating vivid dreams and increased REM sleep I'd taken at night, I'm primarily looking for cognitive enhancements during daytime.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Fatigue from TAK 653,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17qhfhi/fatigue_from_tak_653/

However now if I don’t have it I’m stupidly lethargic. But the reason I started drinking it is because I usually was anyways. So the fact that I am now pretty dependent on caffeine but I still get things done when I drink it to me implies even though the effects aren’t as potent as when I was caffeine naive caffeine still leaves people above baseline unlike the common “as you drink coffee it stops giving you energy and you drink it to feel normal”.
