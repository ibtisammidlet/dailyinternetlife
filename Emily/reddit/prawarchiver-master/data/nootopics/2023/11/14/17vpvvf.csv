PossibilityMinimum36,I normally can handle psychedelic anxiety at least to some extent. Phenibut makes it amazing but don’t wanna get into that. Benzos completely basically kill the trip. I’ve taken Cannabigerol which basically kills the trip as well. But Cannabigerol is an alpha 2 agonist just like guanfacine but it’s also a 5ht1a antag which is prob why the trip gets killed. Since shrooms activates not only 5ht2a but 5ht1a as well,1700159027,k9j7mx7,t3_17vpvvf,t1_k9d194t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
