I want to increase methylation to increase my energy levels

I dont have the MTHFR gene, but I'd still Like to increase methylation because its said to increase energy

Other options are Methylfolate and B3

both are potent methyl-group-scavengers, which means that they reduce the amount of methyl-groups in your body",False,t5_4aoxhu,How does Creatine differ in it’s effects to TMG & B12/ Methylcobalamin for increasing methylation?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17yxzf8/how_does_creatine_differ_in_its_effects_to_tmg/

Bierak,1700364481,self.NooTopics,17ynx1q,True,7,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/17ynx1q/nefiracetam_is_similar_to_sunifiram_lower_doses/,1709901255,10,"According to examine page on Nefiracetam:

""An increased release of acetylcholine (200-211% of baseline within 10-30 minutes, lasting 60 minutes) has been confirmed in the prefrontal cortex of rats fed 1mg/kg nefiracetam (human dose of 0.16mg/kg) with 3-10mg/kg being similarly effective.[38][39] While the release is sensitive to tetradotoxin[39] it is not affected by scopolamine[38] and longer term studies using 10mg/kg have failed to note alterations in basal acetylcholine concentrations (in healthy rats and in brain damaged rats).[40]""

This Is similar to Sunifiram:

""Sunifiram injections at 0.01mg/kg are able to facilitate acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex of rats, with no apparent efficacy at 1mg/kg.[4] The magnitude was around 200% of baseline within an hour of injection.[4]""

The study using 1 MG/Kg doses of Nefiracetam in rats, shows increased PKCalpha and CaMKII activation. Nefiracetam and Sunifiram not only have a similar mechanism of action, both compounds shared the dose responde trend, by having different effects of low doses compared by higher doses.


Since Nefiracetam has more studies compared to Sunifiram, it is possible 1) Use Nefiracetam instead of Sunifiram to be more certain about the safety of the compound. 2) It is possible to draw conclusions about the safety and mechanism of action of Sunifiram by extrapolating the results of Nefiracetam, so we can expand our knowledge of Sunifiram. Nefiracetam has studies in humans. It is worth reading them to see how the authors elaborate on the supposed kidney toxicity of Nefiracetam in dogs. In mice and rhesus monkeys, no kidney toxicity was observed, on the other hand, the dose in dogs was quite high. 

In my experience, Sunifiram is one of the best nootropics that can exist, plus it is cheap. I have experimented with different doses, and low doses of 0.1 - 0.2 mg produce a very good effect in cognition (memory, processing Speed, focus), different from doses greater than 1 mg. Those results are in line with the effects of Sunifiram at low doses, where a 200% release of acetylcholine is observed in the prefrontal cortex. 

In conclusion, for those using Nefiracetam, it is worth exploring the effects of low doses that are in line with the 1 mg/kg dose in rats. That dose is transferred in humans to a dose of 0.16 mg/kg",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Nefiracetam Is similar to Sunifiram: lower doses increases Acetylcholine releases, while higher doses lacks this effect",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17ynx1q/nefiracetam_is_similar_to_sunifiram_lower_doses/

Even microdosing don’t fit. I’ve benzos but It’s not possible for long-term, When I studied on Canada I tried amph but obviously doesn’t work. I think atomoxetine or guanfacine should be fine but I can’t have it in France. I know adhd us complex and overlap with a lot of comorbidities. I struggle with emotionnal dysregulation, Obsessivs thoughts, procrastination, stimming, maladaptative daydream, asd-like symptoms but I’m not. I try to learn about neuroscience and find the right med even if I know lifestyle os the key. So I tried buspirone  and now I take memantine for trichotillomania. I see a clear difference, it works almost like benzos and mph co-adjunction. I don’t know if the improvement is due to nmda antagonism or D2 agonism or both. In fact I do m’y research but if someone who better knows the subject than me can provide clearer informations.
