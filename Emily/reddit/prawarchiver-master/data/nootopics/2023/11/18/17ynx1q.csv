Collationem,"It seems that Nefiracetam is a PAM of the Glycine site of the NMDAR (I knew this already), but what I didn't know is that Sunifiram is apparently an agonist of the Glycine NMDAR. Theoretically it's possible that both may be synergistic. I will start some experiments with low dose Nefiracetam in combimation with low dose Sunifiram and report back.",1701420495,kbix68k,t3_17ynx1q,t3_17ynx1q,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Very interesting. I've done extensive experimentation with Nefiracetam and higher doses have always caused a slight relaxation (possibly due to the GABA-ergic mechanism). Low doses are slightly stimulating, which may be due to this ACh release or NMDA-Glycine PAM activity. I've never dosed as low as 10mg orally though.

Sunifiram does not have the GABA modulation as far as I'm aware. An interesting question would be to what extent Nefiracetam exerts its pro-cognitive effects through GABA modulation (since, for example, GABAA5 NAMs exert cognitive enhancing effects).",1700818338,kajqfsh,t3_17ynx1q,t3_17ynx1q,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bierak,"You could try low doses of Nefiracetam like those indicated in the studies cited in Examine. I don't have Nefiracetam to do my experiments. What I can say is that Sunifiram subjectively produces different effects at low doses versus high doses. In high doses it increases the ability to encode long-term memories, but excessively reduces the speed of processing and textual comprehension. In low doses it increases precisely that: speed, comprehension and working memory also. Memory is not affected in the same way as at high doses, but it is still there increased.
If you find interesting results in low doses, report them please.",1701116471,kb0q2jn,t3_17ynx1q,t1_kajqfsh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"Thanks for the info. I think I'm going to start 10mg Nefiracetam + 0.1mg Sunifiram, both dosed orally in the AM. I have to check if I still have some Suni, but otherwise it's easily available. Nefiracetam is also available at major sellers btw.",1701520986,kbocc6d,t3_17ynx1q,t1_kb0q2jn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
