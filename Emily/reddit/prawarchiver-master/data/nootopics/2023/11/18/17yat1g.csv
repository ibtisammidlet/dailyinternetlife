VillageInevitable,"Sorry you've had such a bad experience, and I'm pleased that memantine is helping. I'm also interested in the mechanisms behind this

The same has happened to me. I started taking my stimulant prescription last November. Unfortunately, this triggered my OCD, which had gotten so bad that I stopped the meds in July. Since stopping, the OCD is still as bad as ever.

I'm in the UK and unfortunately can not get memantine ðŸ˜ž",1700328904,k9sc24v,t3_17yat1g,t3_17yat1g,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Available_Ad6508,"I am not nearly this advanced with nootropics, but after multiple allergic reactions over time, I turned down methylphenidate for a non script a-finil. When I am at my best dual and poly saccharine free people start accusing me of being on ritalin again. It includes reducing multiple forms of concentrated sugars, natural and artificially cooked up. It doesn't include natural and artificial sweeteners, thank foodness.

Could you pass me the blue packet, please?ðŸ˜œâ˜•â˜•",1700329896,k9sef46,t3_17yat1g,t3_17yat1g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Damn that sucks to hear.

Mph was magical when I started.  Now it gives me a brief burst of energy with an edgy crash.  Iâ€™m taking a break from it, and even doing simple tasks takes enormous effort and will power.

Iâ€™m experimenting with 9-me-bc now.  Itâ€™s supposed to restore dopaminergic tone and function.

7 days in, I do seem to be betterâ€¦.but that could be coincidence/placebo 

10-14 days  is when I hear you start to really notice it

Been considering a Memantine cycle tooâ€¦.may lower tolerance",1700353037,k9tu759,t3_17yat1g,t1_k9sc24v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Momotte23,"I took 40mg of mph IR this night and I canâ€™t understand, I donâ€™t feel anxiÃ©ty at all. I think I have an issue related to circadian rythms. I need to investigate seriously and I even want to study in neurobiology",1700357886,k9u4if5,t3_17yat1g,t1_k9tu759,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"Did you take a break recently?

I notice the anxiety temporarily gets better after a long break.  

When I first started taking it I never had anxiety, but now I get strong anxiety particularly when it wears off.

Studying neuro biology can give you a lot of clues into whatâ€™s going on in your head, and tools / nootropics to fix it that your doctor wonâ€™t know about",1700359444,k9u7qjs,t3_17yat1g,t1_k9u4if5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Momotte23,"I didn't take a break since one year even if I took a break during the year. only 0,5mg xan but I did this combination many times and this one I feel that adrenergic activity is way less noticeable. That's strange, maybe memantine effect... I don't know. It seems very complicated but excitating, circadian rythms, serotonin, histamin etc... too much to learn.
