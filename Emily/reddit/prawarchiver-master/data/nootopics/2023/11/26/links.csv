Particularly troubling are symptoms akin to ADHD, such as poor attention and impulsivity. These issues have severely hampered my ability to establish even basic, positive habits. I sought guidance in the book ""Atomic Habits,"" hoping its strategies could assist in managing my executive dysfunction. However, I struggled to consistently apply these techniques. For instance, in an effort to reduce impulsivity, I removed junk food from my environment, only to impulsively reorder it, succumbing to cravings and poor impulse control.

Additionally, I attempted to apply the book's principles to develop exercise habits, like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), known to benefit ADHD. However, my motivation fluctuated wildly, leading to sporadic adherence rather than the planned four times a week routine. This inconsistency in prioritizing long-term goals, such as regular exercise, study habits, adequate sleep, and a healthy diet, has taken a toll. My inability to act in the best interest of my future self has led to a spiral of depression and self-doubt, further exacerbating my struggles with executive function.

My academic life has also suffered. Despite a deep interest in computer science and a strong desire to excel in this field, my inhibitory control issues have led to a lack of action. I've missed numerous university sessions and have barely studied since starting my program. This lack of engagement is not due to a lack of care, but rather an inability to translate intention into action and CONSISTENTLY too. Persistency non-stop execution. 

Moreover, my poor inhibitory control has contributed to an addictive personality, leading to dependencies on various forms of media, such as porn, YouTube, and social media platforms. Even after deleting TikTok and Instagram, I found myself addicted to YouTube. My inability to focus exacerbates this issue, as I often can't even maintain attention on longer videos.

This pattern of self-sabotage permeates all aspects of my life, stemming from my executive dysfunction. Seeking solutions, I've considered prescription medication, but in the UK, options like Ritalin or guanfacine are expensive and have long waiting times for private prescriptions. Public health avenues, such as the NHS, offer little immediate hope due to extensive wait times. In my quest for alternatives, I discovered fasoracetam and pramiracetam, which my research suggests might offer some relief.

With exams approaching, the urgency to address these issues intensifies. Already, I've missed quizzes and fallen behind in my computer science course. I'm eager to learn coding and catch up with my peers, but my executive function challenges continue to be a significant barrier.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Just ordered Pramiracetam and Fasoracetam on every chem.

I don’t know why it’s rare to find the oral / capsule BPC 157 and the ones that I found seem sketchy with many people who bought them from those companies saying it wasn’t actual BPC 157 or that it was extremely minimal. I really only trust everychem tbh with nootropics or certain type of peptides.,False,t5_4aoxhu,Can the owner of everychem take recommendations? He probably won’t see it but I would love if he could make BPC 157 in oral / capsule form and still bioavailable.,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/184im37/can_the_owner_of_everychem_take_recommendations/
