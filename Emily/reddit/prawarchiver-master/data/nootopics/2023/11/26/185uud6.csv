Anyway, Racetams might help. Try ALCAR. If you don’t have theanine and a meditation protocol, they’d probably help.

soimyan,"Hello, brother in distress! I'm experiencing the same symptoms, I don't know how much you know about ADHD, but you definitely have ADHD, bro... and possibly asd... they often go hand in hand with ADHD. But there's nothing wrong with that, as it turns out for me.
The following stack should help you, though:
- Microdosing amanita muscaria 2 grams in the morning. Very good for ADHD people, for we have a deficiency of GABA neurotransmitters.
- microdosing lion's mane, aka hericium erinaceus. 15 grams, there's no point in taking more than that, usually. Enhances the growth of neurons and their connections. It is desirable to drink with sunflower lecithin and sources of choline (choline will be needed in very large quantities, you can not stand to eat so much natural food), ideally you should take alpha gpc as a source of choline and not only. You can eat garlic additionally, the internet says it enhances the effect of lion's mane.

Well, and the racetams you mentioned, they help the brain to work better and more efficiently, students love racetams, and for good reason!
For the same discipline, it helps with ADHD to use omega 3-6-9, be sure to eat with something naturally fatty at the same time!

skytouching,"I’d snort it in multiple 3-6 mg doses up to thirty but usually fifteen-ish. Unless while on a stimulant it’s really not so great for me. I did go through a period of stacking with nsi 189 that was a good stack. On a stimulant or off it really mostly just feels like a mao an inhibitor. Like thh or harmine. And the rush from insulation also feels serotonergic to me.
I personally didn’t experience the hype and I don’t want to question people’s accounts but I really do wonder if there’s not a psychological element to some accounts. Every one can respond differently to any given noot but, it’s not a glutamatergic or anything where specific neurology might account for different responses. Inducing gdnf is pretty straightforward.

Now I’m not saying that for all people and i recall before I first tried it back like 2020 2019… when it was new I read a few accounts of tolerance reduction but they were taking it with stimulants concurrently.

Idk see how it goes. For me the best thing for efficacy has been time but different meds. If you have a cool doctor a cycle between mixed salts dextro and a very underrated med is focalin or dexmethylphenidate. I personally will not take methylphenidate at all in any form. It’s not great in the first place, time release forms only last four hours and a second dose just prolongs the comedown. For me atleast. Focalin is nothing like that is very smooth and you can take a second dose.

I will say that bromantane is misunderstood it could really drive me to and strengthen bad habits my theory is that once the extra dopamine is there it’s going to express in circuits that it knows.

CryptoEscape,"Some comments just send me down a rabbit hole, and yours was one of those.  Appreciate it.

I heard 9-me-bc could cause nose bleeds (which I’m prone to) so haven’t tried intranasal.  Had no idea there was any kind of rush to it either.  My psychonaut, recovered addict, Self may have to try this.

But tbh I was not expecting a buzz, much less a rush.  I was just looking to restore/ repair my dopamine.  My ADHD meds haven’t been working well lately, having anhedonia, and Kratom use is excessive.

It took about 8 days to feel better,.. but now I’m wondering how much is due to the MAOI, or  the dopamine repair.

I’m going to have to stop 9-me-bc in 2 weeks, so I’m worried about the anhedonia returning, along with my Kratom use.

The Harmala alkaloids actually look really interesting.  Glad you mentioned them…,I just ordered a bunch to experiment with.  If I feel like garbage again after stopping 9-me-bc, I’ll likely continue with the harmala alkaloids…,anything to stay off Kratom (crashes my testosterone)

9-me-bc seems most beneficial for people with fairly damaged/ down-regulated dopamine.  

I haven’t been taking my stimulants concurrently for now, want to fully repair things….but will need to go back on them soon…super curious if my tolerance actually went down though.

I’ve always wondered about cycling the meds too.  It is an option.  

Def agree about DexMethylphenidate being superior to Methylphenidate.  Methylphenidate had this weird combo of euphoria and dysphoria…,felt good and energetic, with this sense of doom in the background.  Horrible , panicky crash.

DexMethylphenidate IME is euphoric, a strong sudden burst of energy and focus, for about 30 min, followed by another 60 min of focus, and then a crash….not as bad a crash as Methylphenidate, but it still sucks.  Tbh it almost feels more recreational/ like a high, than functional…,I’m considering asking for the steady release version (not XR) called AzStarys.

But yeah DexMethylphenidate does lack the intense focus Amphetamine has, but it still helps.

Pure DextroAmphetamine Sulphate (Dexedrine, Zenzedi) looks like Adderall with less side effects….my last psychiatrist refused to discuss it, probably because I’m a former addict.  The reduced side effects increase the abuse potential.",1701271790,kb9rzg0,t3_185uud6,t1_kb5r71e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"Ithat’s refreshing to hear from someone. In this community.

But yeah insulation really really really burns like none other. And it’s kinda tough you have to have a totally clear cavity. And I only call it a buzz because idk how else to describe it it’s not pleasant or unpleasant but it’s rapid. At the smaller doses it’s minor if existent around 3-5 mg but if you go like fifteen all at once there is some sort of pret strong psychoactive effect I guess you could compare it to nicotine with a low tolerance but only in three strength of effect. When I was having success I found that the smaller doses throughout the day were effective. I think I first decided to do it to avoid as much peripheral maoi as possible just based on a hunch.
Good for you with the kratom I’m almost done with a complete taber and it’s not bad but not pleasant.

Do your research on the harmalas I believe there documented serious benzo antagonists tremor and possibly deaths. 
I personally hardly tried tried harmine I just noticed a what I’m certain was raise in bp. Not much mentally. Thh was pretty interesting on the days it worked a general mood lift but still cardiovascular effects. 

It really seems that my mao-a response is atypical. 

I concure with all things methylphenidate related basically to a t.

And Dexedrine is ultimately superior to mixed salts. Almost like the methylphenidate topic. Really clear less hyperfocus snd most unpleasant effects of mixed salts.
Ultimately it’s still amphetamine and the same thing happens with tolerance and redosing turning into abuse and ultimately not sustainable for me.

I had a doctor that had me on 90 mg a day sometimes Dexedrine and adderall along with ambien ultimately abilfy and me checking into the mental hospital for the days. So I’m kinda at the point where I’ll take my sisters for tasks like moving or just things that I have no coping method for and still end up staying up all night and it’s really just there way it is for me and i accept it at this point but I stay goal oriented and once it’s complete it’s a few days in bed and like a week of normalization.

It’s just not a viable option for me as a chronic therapeutic. 

Tbh I used to take psychedelics recreationally quite a bit when I was younger and I believed that there was therapeutic benefits for people I was skeptical of microdosing but about four months ago I was going through a rough transition and later realized I had been self sabotaging and constantly stressed and my friend had some really strong lsd and I just wanted to take a break from the stress no intention setting just wanted to get high on acid tbh but I had a pretty strong and uncomfortable trip but still fun to hang out and talk. And after I woke it was like all the stress clutter and a little bit more was routed out of my brain and I had a fresh look and got moved out and have been doing really well since. I still have struggles with mental health but there was a profound psychoplastic change. And I have done it a couple times since and really i have no next day fresh out look or mood lift. And that’s been there most beneficial experience with any substance I’ve ever had in my life. I can’t recommend it according to the rules and if anyone were to try explaining similar results I think that their chances might be limited. But not something to discount. 
I’ll just add that it it self wasn’t antidepressant but allowed me to make situational changes that ultimately were.",1701317274,kbd13t7,t3_185uud6,t1_kb9rzg0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
