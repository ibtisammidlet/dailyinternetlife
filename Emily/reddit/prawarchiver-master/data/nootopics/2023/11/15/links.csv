On october 28th I had taken 15 mg of temazepam for minor sleep issues with maybe some heightened next day anxiety but other than that okay. Flash forward to october 3rd my doctor had told me to try 30 mg instead of 15 since the 15 didn't give me much more sleep. I am a small female and this is equivalent to 1mg or more of
хапах.
That next day after taking the first 30 mg dose of pills I took a bunch of these supplements from Cellcore I will attach at like 8 am. A while later I was trying to drive places and couldn't remember how to get where I was going around my house and also noticed I felt completely wired on. From that moment on this feeling stayed with me and had stayed with me to this day. I ended up taking an herbal supplement I have used for a while now mid day to try to calm me down from the anxiousness of feeling like I had dementia and feeling so awake. By night time I wanted to sleep on my own and not take any more benzos so I took wood betony and blue vervain herbs and a micro dose of melatonin. By 1:30 am I was still awake and caved into taking another 30 mg of temazepm. Ever since that day I cannot feel sleepy or tired I have lost consecutive days of sleep and although I feel horrible I do not ever crash or feel sleepy or groggy. I am also experiencing horrible anhedonia. Someone please explain what I did to myself basically I was reading a lot of these supplements also work in gaba and neurotransmitters i believe i screwed my brain up beyond repair since on top of all of this I had also taken the two moderate doses of benzos. I'm only 23 and feel like my life is over I have symptoms of benzo withdrawal since the 3rd and i feel like my body is reacting to anything i try to put in it now",False,t5_4aoxhu,Need Help Emergency Situation,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17vu713
