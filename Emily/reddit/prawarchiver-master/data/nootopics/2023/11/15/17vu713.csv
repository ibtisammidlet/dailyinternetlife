verysatisfiedredditr,"Blue vervain seems to be a gaba agonist like benzos, at a glance.  

NAC affects some people badly, there are posts around reddit, people who get a long term anhedonia.

Sunlight is linked to neurotransmitter production, even melatonin, so a free thing you can do is circadian health.  Basically see sunrise, sunset, go outside periodically, especially mid morning and try to not see light that is any more white/blue than firelight after sunset, but especially 3hr before bed.  

Melatonin supplements can affect mood so dont continue that for now.

Still guessing its gaba related.  Id say take more magnesium just note higher doses can cause a sort of apathy /anhedonia/fog.",1700070986,k9dwwgg,t3_17vu713,t3_17vu713,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

gitfetchmorecoffee,"Don't fret, you are fine. Your anxious, and putting yourself into a negative thought loop. Just forget about it. Take your temazepam, get a good sleep tonight, and relax. There's no brain damage, nothing interacted, your temazepam dose is low. You don't need a doctor, you just have to find something that relaxes you and keep your mind busy. Your going through an anxiety loop, thinking you messed your brain up permantly, and now your vulnerable to try whatever crazy drug these people recommend your to snort or inject. Just don't worry, stressing too much will put you into a depression. If you need someone to help you chill and help you realize your anxiety is causing this I'm here to chat.

chachbagmcgraw,"You're welcome. You're gonna be ok, I really believe that. Try your best to relax. I'm going through something similar after 1 dose of something that should be out of your system completely within 2-3 days. A couple days after I took it I slept less than an hour for the first 2 nights, then didn't sleep at all for 3 days. I would jolt up with an involuntary gasp if I was about to doze off. Heart palpitations. My skin was burning. I was wired all day for those 5 days, not tired at all, just internally freaking out. 

I finally got some sleep for a couple days, then it came back with another sleepless night. Now I'm still experiencing difficulty sleeping but not nearly as bad. I am sleeping, it's just very crappy, disjointed sleep. The whole thing is super scary. Feels like you're dying or you'll never sleep again. I too am not sure what I did to my brain, but all we can do is give it time. It's been 3 weeks for me, I feel a lot better than initially but still struggling with symptoms. I also could not focus on anything those first 5 days, couldn't even distract myself with a show or something. I can now and everything is much more mild. 

Maybe it is just anxiety, who knows. That's what doctors said after I went in for EKG, but it's not like they check everything so I'm skeptical. Just one normal ekg and straight to anxiety. I also neglected to mention the dose I took that I believe caused this. I think I definitely triggered a cascade of excitatory neurotransmitters somehow, and things will hopefully gradually rebalance. The less you mess with it exogenously probably the better, but I did take a few meds to get through some of the worst days and days I needed to be more functional. You're gonna be ok.

gitfetchmorecoffee,"You need to just go ahead and take the temazepam, and get some sleep. Your cognition is going to continue getting worse, as will the anxiety. Don't worry about dependence(the point that you require the med to keep withdrawal away,). You will have to take temazepam a few weeks for this to even become an issue, and even then symptoms would be mild. Your sleep architecture is important too - if you do not want to take temazepam, or trazodone, than you should ask your doctor about zopiclone. Zopiclone is definitely my favorite - it is not a benzodiazepine though acts on the bzd sites of the gaba A receptors much like a benzodiazepine. It is great as you wake up feeling chipper - it maintains a healthy sleep architecture, puts you to sleep quick, and is less habit forming(though nothing wrong with using it nightly as tolerance doesn't form like it would a benzo) it's the brother of ambien, and the much better one imo. Low dose seroquel is the other option, though not my cup of tea.

Why don't you have a few hour nap for the next few, then hit the hay a little early tonight with the temazepam, or trazodone.  The oxidative stress from not sleeping is much worse for you than either medication.",1700143837,k9i3egv,t3_17vu713,t1_k9htz21,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
