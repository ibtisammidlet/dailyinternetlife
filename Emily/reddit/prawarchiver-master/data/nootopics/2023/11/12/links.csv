For example Nootropics Depot used to have the option of buying Fasoracetam at 5 grams for $60. This is currently what nootropicsource offers but obviously I wouldnâ€™t want to have to resort to buying from them with their reputation lol,False,t5_4aoxhu,Everychem Fasoracetam 5 Gram Option?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17tpwhu/everychem_fasoracetam_5_gram_option/
