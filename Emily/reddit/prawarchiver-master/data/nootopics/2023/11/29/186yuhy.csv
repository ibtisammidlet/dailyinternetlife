sirsadalot,"Research on ADHD is mixed (some studies show improvement, some show no statistical benefit), but I didn't list it for ADHD. It's due to this study in TC-1734 had substantial cognitive benefit to normal, healthy people: https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s00213-006-0675-x

Substantiated by nonhuman primate studies for delayed matching with ABT, indicative of improved visual working memory. Plus the pharmacokinetics and mechanistic data is super similar between the two compounds.

I'm going to make an in-depth post on it soon to explain why I went through the trouble of having it made. In short, it presents as a true nootropic for all of Corneliu's criteria: cognitively enhancing, low/ no side effects/ toxicity, and neuroprotective.",1701294166,kbbhzux,t3_186yuhy,t3_186yuhy,1,True,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,Research conclusively agrees on 24+ hour cognition enhancement despite short half life for multiple a4b2 partial agonists. The price is the lowest out of all custom synthesis I've done.,1701293751,kbbgvcy,t3_186yuhy,t1_kbb8z5a,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

It seems very interesting!
Maybe a new breakthrough for improving cognition,like TAK-653?

This should help to explain it. Similar findings with ABT and other nicotinic agonists at a4b2, but they only remarked how the neuroprotective effects got better under ABT with chronic use. But it's via the same mechanisms and occurs with nicotine too. Doesn't seem like metabolites are necessary for this effect either.",1701298745,kbbu072,t3_186yuhy,t1_kbbiy6a,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
