FrogFister,"You get energy from expending it, that's the secret. The more energy you spend, the more you have. When you're low, it feels difficult but trust the journey and progress. I would recommend you add 20mg PQQ each morning as well and experiment with Shilajit for bursts of energy (not stimulant) to use when you want to exercise. Remember that walking is also exercising and you can really help your body a lot. If you feel bored to walk just listen to a podcast or audiobook while you do, whatever it takes you to build momentum. If you can get endorphins from an activity each day especially in the morning, it will really really help.",1699258019,k81male,t3_17os21v,t3_17os21v,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"I was on a similar combination, Suboxone instead of Sublocade. 

For me, I found the problem to be NAC. It induces anhedonia for me bad, and it dulls stimulants significantly for me so modafinil, sabroxy, amphetamine… etc. were not helping at all. 

Also, I found Polygala best to be removed when trying to diagnose the problem. It has some weird effects at times and it’s hard to gauge what is the issue.

Gabapentin is really mild especially at such a low dose that you’re on, but it would be helpful to get off of it as well. I suggest Agmatine Sulfate to help with tapering, as well as Bromantane, maybe fasoracetam (I haven’t had conclusive results with it), and maybe Beta Alanine to help with anxiety from stopping it (maybe, it helps a lot with Phenibut). I’ve never had Gabapentin WD even from high dosages for prolonged periods of time, but I have experienced Phenibut WD.

Agmatine itself has its own set of effects and may make you feel different. Many say it helps them with depression and anhedonia.


Also, do this supervised with you psychiatrist or primary care physician but I really hate Zoloft and all SSRIs/SNRIs. I’d come off if I was you, but I am not you and you just do what’s best and what your doctor recommends.",1699298123,k83w9c4,t3_17os21v,t3_17os21v,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"First off, I would recommend the nasal spray from Everychem. That ROA is by far the best and most noticeable in my experience, and it would seem the community shares that opinion as well. 

I would start with 2 sprays. Wait 15-30 minutes. And gauge from there. I’ve comfortably used 8-12 sprays, twice a day before.

I would use up to 8-12 sprays because it was recommended to me by another intelligent user ( /u/Hxmusa )in this sub in a post where I asked if it reduces phenibut’s effects. He suggested using a high dose during the initial phase of phenibut discontinuation. I gave it a try and found it helped a lot with sluggishness, mood, motivation, and anxiety during the acute stage. 

Also, in my experience along with others Bromantane dulls/diminishes the euphoric/recreational effects of both Phenibut and Gabapentin significantly. I find this is helpful because you’re less prone to mega dosing, compulsive redosing, at least I was. 

Also, it will increase dopamine and help repair your dopaminergic system the process. See /u/sirsadalot post regarding this. 

I also wasn’t a fan of Agmatine. It made me feel weird. I only use it to when quitting phenibut. I tried it also to see if it would potentate my Suboxone in anyway, it did not.

But I really really reeeallly suggest dropping the NAC. Give yourself 7-10 days for all of it to get out and see if it helps with the depression, lethargy, and anhedonia. It changed my life around personally. I now only use 600 mg NAC maybe 1-2x a week as mostly a tool to either prevent myself from continuing a stimulant binge (due to its dulling effect), to help reduce some cravings or compulsive behavior I may be experiencing at the time. 2000 mg is way to high too. I’ve done the same as you 1200-2400 mg a day of NAC. Less is more, but none is best for me :)",1699302536,k848o3n,t3_17os21v,t1_k8464jg,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Faso may actually block the effect of GABA-B agonists such as Baclofen or Phenibut so dont mix like many people do, but then when taken when not on influence said to lower the tolerance which of course then means lower addiction as well.
