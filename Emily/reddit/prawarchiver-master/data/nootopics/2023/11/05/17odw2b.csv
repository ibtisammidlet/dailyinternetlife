Collationem,"Unselective serotonin antagonists are aweful - especially Cyproheptadine which has an extremely dirty pharmacology. Metergoline is a direct dopamine agonist, you don't want that for obvious reasons.

Serotonin antagonises dopamine mainly and perhaps exclusively through agonising 5HT2C receptors. Your best bet would be to find a selective 5HT2C antagonist (they aren't available). Next best thing is probably Agomelatine, it's quite dopaminergic and noradrenergic. Bonus points because it enhances sleep as well. 

Antagonising 5HT2A (and to a lesser-extent 5HT1A) is basically the opposite of microdosing. Not desirable from a cognitive point of view. Stacking serotonin antagonists with psychedelic microdoses to hit 5HT2A is a nice idea but won't work (tried it). The antagonism will overpower any positive effects from the microdose. Furthermore almost all serotonin antagonists are, as mentioned above, extremelt dirty. I'd personally stick to microdoses with possible augmentation of IN/SL Agomelatine.

MAOIs are good, but not for everyone. They vibe really well with my neurochemistry. Selegiline/Tranylcypromine with Bromantane (dopaminergic and GABA-T inhibitor) is very good, it's basically Phenelzine (also a GABA-T inhibitor, but with more side effects) on steroids. MAOIs in general will absolutely annihilate any form of depression, low mood or anhedonia in the vast majority of people. Personally, I wouldn't bother with harmala alkaloids. Too dirty pharmacology.

Agree with most of the rest of your article. I can tell you're inspired by Peat, which by itself is fine. I just don't like his flawed idea that serotonin = evil. The Peat forum is a joke though.",1700217704,k9mena2,t3_17odw2b,t3_17odw2b,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

MrNeverEverKnew,"For people who wonder, the end conclusion about a possible and recommended stack is:

“Simplest stack I’d go for would be:
9-Me-BC for 3 months (ideally in winter because of UV photosensitivity) + rasagiline as long as you cycle 9-me-bc 10mg daily for MAO-B inhibition → neuroprotection from neurotoxic NNMT enzyme (inhibited by NAD+/Nicotinic acid) metabolite (2,9mebc) + 2.5mg bromocriptine/25ug LSD as serotonin partial agonist/antagonist + 50mg adamantane/100mg amantadine/50mg bromantane + 20mg methylphenidate + 1.5g ALCAR + 1 drop weekly of Energin + 500mg nicotinic acid daily for NNMT inhibition + 200ug NorBNI once a month for KOR downregulation + 2g agmatine + 1-10mg lithium (NOT WITH LSD though, risk of seizure)“",1699306074,k84j0ns,t3_17odw2b,t1_k84d3b2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"9-Me-BC (IN) + Selegiline (IN or IM) + Bromantane (IN or IM) is probably one of the best nootropic and anri-depressant stacks I ever tried. I'm on it for life. You basically fully hit MAOA and MAOB, while Selegiline has a PPAP-like effect as a CAE. Bromantane further raises dopamine and provides a GABA-ergic component through GABA-T inhibition. It's literally impossible to have a low mood on this stack.

If you want to upgrade your brain further to god-tier, you can stack TAK-653, Nefiracetam and a NN-DMT microdose.",1700219240,k9mgixq,t3_17odw2b,t1_k84kzld,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"The AD stack I take daily. The other three I'm still experimenting with (mainly dose and optimal ROA). 9-Me-BC and the others are research chemicals (except for Selegiline and Bromantane, DMT probably as well) so the safety profile has not been established.

Collationem,"Would gladly join the Discord - send me a PM :). Hpcd complexing is actually really easy, just compute the molar ratio, dump the appropriate amounts of the compound and Hpcd in a jar, add water and mix. Sadly it doesn't work for all water-insoluble compounds (i.e. dihexa, ISRIB still require a nasal spray unfortunately).

I have no source on the possible nasal damage, but if you have taken 9-Me-BC intranasally you'll know what I mean. Burns like a MF.",1706622843,kk9a77o,t3_17odw2b,t1_kk8gkhs,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
