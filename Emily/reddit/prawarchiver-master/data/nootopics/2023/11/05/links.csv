For context, 54F diagnosed with OSA, depression, anxiety, and general fatigue (which I equate wirh my depression.) I am a little overweight and get no exercise, but hoping to start working out again when I can feel some energy. For prescription I take Zoloft 150mg, Modafinil 100mg, and am also on Sublocade low dose for prior substance abuse. I am also prescribed Gabapentin 600mg/3x/day which is quite beneficial when I take all at once instead for energy, hence I run out pretty quickly of, and I know that's not how it's prescribed! What I'm looking for is to stop the Gabapentin and replace with something more beneficial and less addictive. For noots I take 2000mg NAC, 2000mg Sarcosine, and 200mg polygala daily in the AM. this combo has helped my depression and anxiety 10fold. Wondering if adding Sabroxy or Kanna, or something more stimulating would be my final piece? Any thoughts on those or something else that might be more like a Gabapentin feeling if there is such a thing? Again, I want to replace the Gabapentin, not continue with it.
