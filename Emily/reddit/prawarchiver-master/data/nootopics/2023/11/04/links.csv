Veering into this subreddit at someone’s suggestion to ask about a very speciric issue.
I feel that post covid my libido ( and to some extent motivation and to some extent memory ) have been affected negatively. Or course, no one really believes me as they don’t know amyone else with this kind of side effects ( me neither) but it’s been an year and i feel is time for me to try ti be pro active.

My blood work is great. So my research and conckusion is that, well, must be something related to dopamine and serotonine. Dunno which. Perhaps inflammation too.

I am not sure how to proceed as i am also very scared of side effects so i want to take it slowly and evaluate in small steps.

But where to start?
Any suggestions from people who maybe understand these things better?
I say i need ti start taking something that will help my dopamine and see how i respond, but what? 

I have a prescription for bropotitone from  my doctors But he just said that i descriebe depression whereas i thibk is related to covid as the symptoms started after it.

Please be kind to me as i am actually very scared there is nothing i can do and honestly it sucks to not be as hornt as i used ti be and doubt that my brain is as it wasbefore..

Thanks!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Looking for some experimentation after post covid symptoms that might be cause by dopamine/serotonine changes and/or inflamation,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/17nv54q/looking_for_some_experimentation_after_post_covid/
