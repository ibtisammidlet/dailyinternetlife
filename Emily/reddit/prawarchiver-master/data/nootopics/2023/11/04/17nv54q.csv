Upset_Scientist3994,"There was some research, that so called long corona disease may actually essentially to do with mitochondrial malfunction among other things. This would explain strange nature of this thing, where is hard to get grip on and which can manifest itself in so numerous ways. Probably microcirculation damage what was connected with most earliest virus variants, and chronic neuroinflammation could be connected or actually intertwined in self-feeding loop with aforomentioned.",1699200364,k7xwxur,t3_17nv54q,t3_17nv54q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Check this out, as it also points into mito dysfunction theory. “the chronic disease \[of COVID\] is due to changes in the metabolism of tryptophan and the lack of niacin (NAD/NADH+).” [https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-7-195.php?jid=jide&s=09](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-7-195.php?jid=jide&s=09)

Also thiamine in various forms in essential in mithocondrial energy production, so this would make logic from that perspective. And that idea makes sense to add even more mito energy production co-factors - very same to fight aging if this mito connection with long corona symptoms is largely true. https://www.hormonesmatter.com/recovering-from-long-covid-with-thiamine/",1699203925,k7y6k0d,t3_17nv54q,t3_17nv54q,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"NADH also matters for dopamine & serotonin production. If there is severe lack of NADH (connected say with alcoholism as its metabolism burns it away, but downlooked element of it). At least earlier intravenous NADH was been researched for Parkinson patients with success, and also with substance abuse problems both connected with dopamine output. Nowadays intravenous is no more needed as there has emerged some forms of NADH what do absorb from capsule form, and as far as I have understood NMN, Niacin in megadoses, NR and all the rest of NAD+ precursos should be capable to do the same. 

So what is mentioned as a theory of NAD+ factor behind long covid symptoms, this would also explain its connection to lack of dopamine. 

Also any sort of inflammation instantly drops dopamine levels as we all have experienced. And those symptoms can be felt with longcovid, although sometimes not there but even smallest physical effort one day may make you feel as if you had run marathon or drank heavily previous day (as I felt) what again points out to possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Inflammation as such alone can be treated with some supplements, like PEA if it would help for dysforia, as in this case I do not believe that NAC style antioxidant upregulation alone would help if inflammation is of viral origin. Some other supplements as well may have directly inflammation suppressing impact coupled with antioxidant propensities, and something like alpha-lipoic acide or preferably R-lipoic acid sodium stabilized could be tried as it was able to suppress inflammation independent of antioxidant effects, along with being cofactor with numerous mitochondrial energy production processes. I guess rather big stack of everything connected with these directions to look at would be worthwile trying, coupled just with things that enhance micro-circulation (like Gingko, or microdosing Aspirin).",1699204487,k7y84yz,t3_17nv54q,t1_k7y6k0d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
inamsterdamforaweek,"I am thankful but I do not understand much. I will take NAM ( or NAC?), i am also ordering Curcumin and Garlic extract ( for inflammation etc ) but I am not suee what else tou suggest here cause most if what you wrote kind kf went over my head :)
So if tou suggest any supplements specifically would be grateful ( i usually buy from NootropicDepot ).",1699206429,k7ydlr2,t3_17nv54q,t1_k7y84yz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"What is NAM?

Garlic has blood thinning impact, and may aid with microcirculation if that is damaged. 

There are only just pre-supposements what is wrong with long covid disease, and it is also political thing; it is not wanted to admit that it exists no matter how much casualties are, so the blame is on the sick people what is wrong. But then again symptoms are very diverse, may be highly different with different people and seemingly different variants of virus created different impact. Earliest and most deadliest Wuhan variant seemingly ruined your microcirculation system among other things, which is detrimental for brains dependant on it. Late Omicron variants mostly just inflammation-related tiredness, amotivation, and dysforic feelings are just there what seem to be related to high inflammation what creates low dopamine levels. 

Good curcumin extract was one of herbal stuff what could block some inflammation signalling directly beyond being also that via antioxidant way, so that may be too good choice to start with and then to extend stack when seeing one by one what is reaction to those added there.",1699212796,k7yvnau,t3_17nv54q,t1_k7ydlr2,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
inamsterdamforaweek,"I meant NMN. 
I had omicron. I mostly just feel rhat my motivation was affected and my libido lowered and maybe some memory issues. Im also 40+ so age definitely is part of it.
I’m gonna try NMN, curcumin, garlc and micro dosing aspiring ( what would you say is microdose?). And looking to get other things down the line like R-ALA etc. before trying some dopamine pharma meds directly. My general feeling is that I need a little helo but who can tell, as you say, it’s not very discussed and hopefully more research wil go into it in time.
Thank you for your input!",1699213100,k7ywh0p,t3_17nv54q,t1_k7yvnau,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
