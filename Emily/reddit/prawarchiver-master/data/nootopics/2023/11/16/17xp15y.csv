labratdream,"Well it may be contaminated with some leftovers from synthesis. Only pramiracetam due to pH may cause chemical burns in contact with nasal or mouth mucosa.
Many rc taste strange, chemical first like it is a in case of cyclazodone or may burn like  ppap when delived intranasally however it will not cause chemical burns.

It is the best to ensure high quality and purity by doing third-party testing which is quite expensive or buy exactly same compound  from different vendor and with the same  equal purity level. If it differes in taste or even look it is worth to investigate the reasons for such difference.
It is better to be safe than sorry.",1700276180,k9pz6a1,t3_17xp15y,t3_17xp15y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
