Birdy1979,"Hi, sorry, no productive input answering your question, but Following this, with a thumbs up üëç . Interested to know. Sirsadalot may know .

For what it‚Äôs worth, I also take quite a few of supplements you take including intranasal Bromantane .",1700146832,k9iaodg,t3_17wmcxm,t3_17wmcxm,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

1000100220012003,"Hey man. I have started using ALCAR too at 500mg daily. People usually report all kinds of positives when you can hardly be sure to relate it to that x supplement. ALCAR also gives me noticeable effect, almost like a Ritalin effect with less stimulation. 

The day I don‚Äôt take it, I see the difference. I don‚Äôt know why specifically it affects some of us more than others. It intervenes in the metabolism of fats and acetylcholine production (cognition) in the mitochondria (energy factory in the cell). 

The only problem is that anything that usually ends up working meets its end after a while. So I‚Äôm not sure how long this will last and what is the true impact on my body after a short to long term use.",1700145801,k9i82ye,t3_17wmcxm,t3_17wmcxm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

aenkmtnam,"Sorry i am of no help because I keep getting a crash from Alcar, and since we are discussing alcar i want to share my short experience with it. Yeah, I get those benefits, but somehow it messes with my blood sugar. At first i suspected it was messing with my thyroid, but reaction happens so fast even after a long break, about 5 hours after taking it. I see bigger positive effect when combining it with carbs (dry fruit in my case), but bigger crash too hence why i zeroed in on blood sugar flactuations, almost like some form of hypoglycemia. Should I give it a try with chromium or other insulin modulators, or would they make issue worse? Any tips?",1700152658,k9iq02i,t3_17wmcxm,t3_17wmcxm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

freshlymn,This is it. The increased acetylcholine keeps me wide awake. Sadly it‚Äôs not a manageable issue for me. I‚Äôve tried ALCAR off and on over the years and the mental boost is always offset by the unsustainable insomnia. I sleep perfectly fine otherwise. I‚Äôve tried a range of dosages and either it‚Äôs too low for any effect or I‚Äôm wide awake all night.,1700152426,k9ipcyl,t3_17wmcxm,t1_k9iaz5l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

RMCPhoto,"Well that doesn't give me much hope haha...   I'm half way an insomniac anyway and alcar doesn't help.   But, sadly, I feel like I really need to find how i can incorporate it into my day to day.

I will try using it with Piracetam or something else which depletes aCh.

Otherwise, I guess any short lived anticholingergic drug might help with sleep onset?",1700165119,k9jnz39,t3_17wmcxm,t1_k9ipcyl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
