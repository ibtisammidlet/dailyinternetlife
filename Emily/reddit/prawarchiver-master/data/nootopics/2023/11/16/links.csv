I’ve been doing a lot of reading on dynorphins and kappa opioid receptor antagonists, and I’m really starting to believe that something that can decrease dynorphin, or act as an antagonist at kappa opioid receptors may help me. Unfortunately, κOR antagonists are not available as prescription medications yet, and they are impossible to find for a reasonable price online.

Is anyone aware of any drugs or nootropics fitting this description that are available for a reasonable price? If so, please let me know! Also if anyone knows of any other ways to reduce dynorphin, I would love to hear it.

I have been experimenting with nootropics for over 20 years.   My first was piracetam, which opened up all of the other racetams until I found that Phenylpiracetam was the ""best"" for me.   I used RALA, Fish Oil, every vitamin and mineral, choline, 5-HTP, Tryptophan, St Johns, DL Phenyl, Kava, Kratom, CBD, Selegiline, methylphenidate, agmatine, NAC, PQQ,  etc - it goes on and on.  
At the same time (when I was 20-25) I experimented with ALCAR and found that it gave me way  too much nervous energy and anxiety at almost any dose.   Now that I'm 38, the anxiety aspect is much lower  and ALCAR consistently gives me very hightened energy.  I have taken it off and on for 20 years and it is one of the very few supplements which I take note of each time and say ""Ah, this one is  a keeper, it makes a huge difference in  my day to day life"".  


For me, I find that it is best when I cycle it, after a while I seem to get more of the agitation from ALCAR and less of the energy.  After a few days off I'm good again.   It is also somewhat inconsistent, and some days it doesn't seem to work at all.  It has a negative effect on my sleep cycle and worsens insomnia (the biggest downside).  


**Positives:**

* High physical and mental energy (can feel a bit manic)
* High focus
* Increased performance in the gym
* Increased motivation

**Negatives:**

* Sleep onset... seems to have a negative impact on sleep that is persistent no matter how long I take it.  I have energy into the evening which prevents sleep onset.  


**Combinations:**  


* Bromantane seems to combine very well for focus and drive
* PQQ - while COQ10 doesn't have any noticeable effect PQQ does noticeably raise my energy as well  


About me: I am 38 now, Recently I learned that I have CMT-1a, which affects nerve insulation and growth - specifically peripheral nerves.   It's degenerative like MS.   ALCAR is listed as a potential adjunctive therapy  (without significant evidence).    


Can anyone help me understand why ALCAR specifically has such a powerful effect on my body?  


Does anyone know (based on how ALCAR works) how I can improve sleep while taking it?  Is there something which can blunt the effect only temporarily in the evening?",False,t5_4aoxhu,ALCAR - Very significant impact on energy for me (20 years off and on) - why?
