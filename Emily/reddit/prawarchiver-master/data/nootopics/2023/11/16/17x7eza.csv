Studies suggest that the Kappa Opioid receptor is essentially an anti-nootropic. By purely stopping this receptor, whilst leaving everything else untouched, should therefore (in theory) remove this barrier.
And from what i noticed, it does indeed work, although the effects tended to be subtle, but that could be attributable to the minimal dose i used as i wasn‚Äôt going to risk a larger dose of a substance that no human being on planet earth has ever tried.

i actually only recently got into Kratom myself. it used to never do anything to me but i think i was just taking too small a dose. once I did like 3g of White Vein, i saw the mood and energy boost immediately and then spent like two weeks taking it after my lunch break to power me through the afternoon.

i decided i didn‚Äôt want to rely on yet another substance to get me through my day so I just quit it cold turkey and i was actually pretty tired and edgy for a week after but i didn‚Äôt attribute it to any kind of Kratom withdrawals til i spent some time in that subreddit.",1700614678,ka8lhtg,t3_17x7eza,t1_k9s5bv2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Complete_Still7584,"Good choice;). I literally just cold turkey stopped taking 20mg Suboxone 3 months ago. As it caused anhedonia and made me really irritable and jacked up my stomach. Fyi, that was probably the worst opioid withdrawal I've been through. I reached full withdrawal on the 19th day! I used Kratom and loperamide. I dropped the Kratom; but, am still on low dose loperamide and cimetidine. I've tried using ultra low dose naltrexone; but, was sent into precipitated withdrawal every timeüò°.

I Just ordered more powder , the site I use didn‚Äôt have a solution unfortunately, otherwise I would have tried some.

Let us know if that‚Äôs long enough holding it too‚Ä¶.Ive been doing 20 minutes now.  I‚Äôm noticing even more, but it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm later in the cycle.

But wow I‚Äôm really impressed with this molecule‚Ä¶.just ten days ago I felt like garbage.  

Now I‚Äôm feeling somewhat back to normal‚Ä¶not high , not Manic, not stimulated‚Ä¶.just normal‚Ä¶.doing things I need to do isn‚Äôt so daunting.  Libido is slowly returning too.

CryptoEscape,"Yeah agmatine seems safe‚Ä¶.I increased my dose to 750-1,000 mg 4 x a day.  

Yup takes about 3 grams to notice anything from Kratom.  Low doses like that, especially white vein, can be energizing, but more so in a mood boosting way, than a stimulating way.

I used Kratom to get sober , had horrible PAWS and anhedonia, plus severe depression over how much I ruined my life.  It seemed safe and side effect free (Magnesium Citrate every night cured any constipation.)

I quickly was up to over 100 grams per day, a ridiculously high dosage.

I was so depressed at the time, that I didn‚Äôt realize it was crashing my testosterone.  

It wasn‚Äôt until life got better I stopped to question why I still felt like garbage‚Ä¶.had my testosterone tested it was terrible‚Ä¶.then had prolactin checked and it was elevated.  I discovered Kratom could cause that, cut back, and the Testosterone significantly improved (despite still taking up to 40 grams per day)

Recently my ADHD meds began causing more side effects than benefits and fell into Anhedonia, which caused me to increase the Kratom again, and testosterone crashed again.

So now I‚Äôm hoping the 9-me-bc can break this vicious cycle.  Kratom cravings were *significantly* lower around day 8 of the cycle.

In theory you could responsibly use low doses of Kratom‚Ä¶kind of like you can responsibly have 1-2 drinks at happy hour every day‚Ä¶.still not ideal though.",1700671332,kabhuzl,t3_17x7eza,t1_ka8lhtg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

totally personal question but have you noticed it makes orgasms super weak? haha i‚Äôm too early in this cycle to see if that was really the case for me but last time i took 9-Me-BC, my libido did start returning pretty well but my orgasms were like, barely anything, so i barely even got to enjoy it with my lady hah.

Have you been able to stay off meds?  I‚Äôve been mega dosing caffeine, it helps, but still been a struggle‚Ä¶.luckily work is slower now.

I was only on day 3 the last time I had sex, and I hadn‚Äôt felt much from the 9-me-bc yet.  My sex drive was horrendously low, and my orgasms had been weak because of that (even before the 9-me-bc.) Libido starting to come back a bit though.  I‚Äôll see my girl soon, and report back on the orgasms.

Also not taking stimulant meds is making sex wayyy less intense, so there‚Äôs that factor too.  Sex on Amphetamines or even Methylphenidate is savage‚Ä¶..most women love being ravaged like that IME

Interesting point about liquid dissolving faster, never thought of that

I just ordered from science.bio too‚Ä¶they‚Äôre def the best source, a bad synthesis of 9-me-bc can be toxic‚Ä¶ when I ordered the solution wasn‚Äôt loading, but now it is again‚Ä¶.oh well guess I‚Äôll stay consistent with the powder.

donniedenier,"they seem to have a 20% off sale every week, hah. i actually literally just missed the last one by two days when i ordered this round but they also lowered the standard price from $60 to $40 so that was nice.

i‚Äôm only on day 2 of my current cycle so staying off meds is fine so far. today is going to be slow at work, tomorrow i‚Äôm off, and i stupidly volunteered to cover on friday but it‚Äôs likely going to be dead too.

i won‚Äôt really struggle with needing to take meds til monday so i guess i‚Äôll have to see what happens. mondays are unruly at work for me.

i have 600mg so that‚Äôs roughly a 20 day cycle. i feel like from every report i‚Äôve read, 14-30 days is an ideal cycle and anything beyond that is negligible.",1700668545,kababju,t3_17x7eza,t1_kab81yb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
