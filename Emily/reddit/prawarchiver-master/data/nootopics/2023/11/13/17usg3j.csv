Thankkratom2,Just quit it with the benzos.,1699988465,k98znhn,t3_17usg3j,t3_17usg3j,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,"It can cause overdose, damaging gaba receptors takes time though with continual use. If you’re worried about overdose then use caffeine to antagonize gaba receptors and stimulate breathing",1699938757,k96bi0w,t3_17usg3j,t3_17usg3j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Nate2345,"Hi I used to use benzos a lot and I came off and on of them a few times. They are definitely not worth it, though they are amazing for anxiety. The withdrawal is absolute hell and memory loss can be extreme. What’s really the worst though is that you can potentially go into protracted withdrawal which can literally last years. I’ll dm you with some helpful minerals and herbs I find help.",1699990223,k994i3z,t3_17usg3j,t3_17usg3j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dipropyltripopotamus,"Don't worry! There's no such thing that could qualify as 'irreversible damage to receptors'. 

What would happen instead is that your GABA-A and BZD receptors will downregulate (less efficient and dense GABAA receptors for GABA and benzos to bind to >  inhibitory signals are basically useless > even more anxiety than before starting benzos).

I would like to believe that this is much more likely to happen with benzodiazepines alone than with GABA supplements/herbs. 
This is merely a hypothesis but considering benzos are very potent GABAA PAMs, using GABAA PAMs found in plants, with less potent binding affinity and sometimes additional mechanisms of action would be likely to allow your receptors to slightly upregulate. However! To benefit from this you would have to stop using benzos, and this will very likely send you into withdrawals. 

This is something you could talk about with your healthcare provider, but remember that most often than not, benzos are designed to be extremely short term options for anxiety and long term use will basically make it worse.",1700157031,k9j23ws,t3_17usg3j,t3_17usg3j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bananayay6,ever since that day I only did that one time I cannot feel sleepy or tired at all it’s like I’m wired on all day and i barely sleep and have lost all emotions and everything,1699965781,k97dtxy,t3_17usg3j,t1_k96bi0w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Dry_Flower_1802,What helped you the most coming off benzos? I'm taking zopis (for a reason) and I'll be looking to come off them.this year. I'm worried I've fried my gaba receptors,1704546536,kgkumwf,t3_17usg3j,t1_k994i3z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dipropyltripopotamus,"Off benzos, Palmitoyethanolamide, Black Seed Oil, Gotu Kola, Panax Ginseng and Kava could be very useful.",1700157652,k9j3tz3,t3_17usg3j,t1_k9j23ws,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,Try some magnesium l-threonate or agmatine to cancel out the rebound. What you are describing sounds like a glutamate storm. Your CNS needs to be rebalanced,1700009548,k9ai9wk,t3_17usg3j,t1_k97dtxy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

ilovedoxo,It’s highly unlikely because ketamine improves the sensitivity of GABAergic neurons. I did have a coworker that randomly had a seizure at work right after getting a ketamine IV. I’m your case I would definitely get some magnesium to balance things out,1700156958,k9j1wm1,t3_17usg3j,t1_k9fyx4l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dipropyltripopotamus,"Ket releases glutamate in some brain regions. This allows AMPA (a major type of glutamate receptors, along with NMDA and kainate) to upregulate along with MTOR. Ketamine also regulates GLT1 (glutamate transporter 1). These mechanisms of action could be responsible for the ""wired feeling"" 

Also, Ketamine (at least in mice) decreases GAD67 expression which is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of Glutamate to GABA.",1700158343,k9j5q0f,t3_17usg3j,t1_k9j1wm1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
