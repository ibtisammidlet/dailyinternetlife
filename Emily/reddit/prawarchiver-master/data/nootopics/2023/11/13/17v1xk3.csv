verysatisfiedredditr,"I get low level hypermagnesemia just from putting mgcl in my drinking water.  

According to this study many types go to the brain in rodents.  They did not compare to threonate though.

Its not the only form that crosses the blood brain barrier. Humans have existed without it.

Personally, I never noticed anything with magnesium-l-threinatd myself. 

About half the people in the us are low in magnesium. My guess is that it wouldn’t help if you already had enough.

I’m not std you could notice unless you were very low. I really doubt there is a noticeable difference from different forms of Magnesium .",1700002478,k9a1aou,t3_17v1xk3,t3_17v1xk3,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
