there are some really interesting compounds on their homepage. I stumbled upon  PH94B (4-Androstadienol) which is currently in Phase 3 for its potential in treating Social Anxiety. Its a nasal spray.

Has anyone of you already tried it and can report back the effects?

I'm doing a computer programming course in the C language. I code all day long, and it's very tiring! I work out, I eat healthy, I take cold showers, I sleep early and that's the best nootropics I know, there are no magic pills like in the movie limitless. I've tried bromantane, phenylpiracetam and nicotine gum. I really liked bromantane and phenylpiracetam, but I have the impression that tolerance builds up quickly, especially with phenylpiracetam. I even hesitate to try 2 FMA which is not a nootropic 2 times a week, and even take ritalin which is not a nootropic either. If you have any suggestions that would be cool!
I was advised to take fladrafinil, which was the same as vyvanse but apparently stronger. 

 Have a great day!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Stimulating nootropic ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/185vln3/stimulating_nootropic/
