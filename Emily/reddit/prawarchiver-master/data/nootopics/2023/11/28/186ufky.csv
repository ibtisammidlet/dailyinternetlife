Theta_10,No but topical Androsterone at 5mg from IdeaLabs noticeably reduces social inhibition for me. As far as I know it’s a gaba a pam and even tho it’s a dht metabolite it gets converted back into dht by a couple enzymes which seems to have positive effects itself and through other metabolites.,1701307358,kbcef9p,t3_186ufky,t3_186ufky,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

gitfetchmorecoffee,"You haven't noticed too much of an anti-e effect? I loved using androsterone as a natural ai, but even on trt is used to dry my skin and eyes out too much. The other thing that bothers me is wearing a pheromone. The smell used to bug me which was distracting - made me realize pheromones really do have olfactory responses in humans, and that would have me wondering whether or not I was triggering a response in others. It's a great tool, but has downfalls.",1701404654,kbi8mby,t3_186ufky,t1_kbeoat3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

UltraCentillion,I’m on trt and I seem to not get negative effects of low estrogen even at 2-3pg/ml. I usually take 5-10mg per day and 200mg test e per week. Don’t like the smell either but girlfriend does lol,1701466797,kblpx05,t3_186ufky,t1_kbi8mby,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

UltraCentillion,"I don’t have social anxiety as a baseline but I could definitely imagine it would work for that, makes my brain a little quieter. You should look into ray peat, his ways cured both my girlfriend and my brother from specifically social anxiety, I gave them both progesterone which helped a lot.

gitfetchmorecoffee,"Interesting enough, I remember having a couple older women fall in love with me, which I though it was supposed to be the opposite, that women past menses would get agitated from it. Unless these women werent actually dried out yet. The one was pretty cute but had like 8 kids.  


The biggest issue I have is the idea of wearing a phermomone at work. Or sweating and having the pheromone activate the other guys olfactory system. I work with all men in a blue collar trade, I am already much bigger and stronger than most of the guys I work with, I have a shaved head with stubble beard and if im not smiling and in a happy mood, then i would probably be intimidating for most of the guys I work with without the androsterone. So add in the male pheromone, the idea just doesnt sound good. I have no problem commanding respect from my co workers, I dont want the pheromone make them agitated and feel like im attacking them when I tell them to do something.",1701805852,kc4qqsk,t3_186ufky,t1_kblpx05,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
gitfetchmorecoffee,"Yeah, well I definitely think it does. Maybe makes focus a little more difficult. I started using it as something potentially safer to combat elevated estradiol without using AI's. Estrogen is good for us men, though too much can cause issues. So its all about balance, but AI meds are a no go.",1701805375,kc4pii7,t3_186ufky,t1_kbke4lo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
