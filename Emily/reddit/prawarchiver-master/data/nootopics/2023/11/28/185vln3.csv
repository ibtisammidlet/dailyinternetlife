Efik_Pail,"I have the same kind of...situation. 

I sometimes have very long days of work. I am a teacher, i get up at 5.30, some days i work until 9PM to create or update my course and teaching hours in high school are very demanding. 

My week if often 60hours of work per week (18 hours teaching, about 40 hours of personal work) The fact that i have beta-thalassemia (minor, fortunately) does not help.

You seem reasonable and understand that there is no absolute magic pill, especially with stimulants, so we can talk efficiently. First, we are talking about compounds for their stimulating and eugeroic actions. Some of them are nootropics, some are not.

\-Phenylpiracetam is quite potent...but its half life is short and there is a crash (after about 4 hours for me). Tolerance builds fast. Ok to give you a boost for some hours, but it won't do the trick for a full day.

\-Caffeine...well, it's cheap, it works, it's a real help but until a certain point: tolerance is real (but manageable), there is a crash and, although it gives energy, it's not extremely efficient to keep you awake. 

\-Dynamine: Well...it works quickly but has a very short half life, i prefer caffeine. Ok for a pre-workout, maybe or associated to caffeine to give you a kick.

➔ The Dynamax pills from Nootropics Depot are quite good, because they contain Dynamine, Caffeine and delayed release caffeine. It's associated bit some Theanine to smooth it up: it's smoother and longer lasting than plain caffeine.

\-Theacrine: I had some hopes (loooong half life, separate tolerance from caffeine), but it's mild, very mild. By itself, it's worthless for me. It potentiates caffeine, though.

\-Bromantane: Not a stimulant (or very mild) or an eugeroic in itself but this compound is very very interesting. It won't boost you, but it delays fatigue and you recover quicker.

\-Modafinil/Armodafinil and all other -afinils: Ok, it works. It works great. Armodafinil even works for a full day. Modafinil and Armodafinil have a very positive effect on my mood. But classic -afinils (i dont'k know about the fl- versions) need a prescription. There is not a huge tolerance (and tolerance fades quite quickly) but it has to be taken with some care and responsibly. (Adrafinil is a prodrug and hard on the liver. Avoid it)

\-Never tried any harder stims like Adderall and i'll never do.

\-I get some good results with 4-DMA 7'8-DHF (TrkB agonist)...not a stimulant but it seems to a slight eugeroic effect and it can help to focus better when you are tired. Its half life is \*extremely\* long, so if you don't take it very early, it will mess up your sleep.

Let's be clear: use of stimulants should be very casual and you should not combine them if you don't know what you are doing. (Sorry to insist on this aspect, but you never know who is the guy who is reading you.

Don’t mean to be disrespectful, but imo you’re getting relatively exotic for your experience level. Have you tried things like CDP choline/Alcar? Both are dopamine sensitizers. Quitting porn is too. 

Afinils especially considering the half lives have the potential to interact the second day in major ways with ritalin and/or any other stims you might wind up taking.

Neither are noo-tropics but just clean amphetamines/stimulants.
