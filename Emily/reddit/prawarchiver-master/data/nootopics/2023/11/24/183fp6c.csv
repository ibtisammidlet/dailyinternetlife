Efik_Pail,"Hello,
As the others said, Agmatine can be a great help to taper.

You may also take something like a good multivitamin. It seems stupid to mention something so mundane, but while getting clean, your appetite may be a bit upset and it's important to maintain a general healthy state.

Things which raise BDNF like Semax or something more potent like Cerebrolysin are a great help, but should be used at the right time:

Semax/Na-Semax or more potent peptides (Cerebro, Cortexin) raise BDNF, improve neuroplsticity and help brain repair.
It helps, among other things, to build new habits, new routines...so be sure to use them when you feel quite stable to build -good-  routines!

On another level, if you can, go to the gym (or any sport you like) if you don''t now, go hiking if you can.
You need to make a clear ""cut"" with the routine when you used to be addict.

I never been severely addict to anything (a bit to Benzos many years ago) except to Nicotine (I don't smoke anymore but I still vape) but I know many people who used to be.

Ps: if you feel anxious while getting off this sh*t,  you may use some anti-anxiety herbs (Rhodiola Rosea in the day, Valerian and Hawthorn in the evening) or a mild calming non addictive compound like Selank.",1700911878,kaop748,t3_183fp6c,t3_183fp6c,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

NAC, BSO/thymoquinone, NA-selank, perhaps cerebrolysin/cortexin, high/frequent dose vitamin c.

CryptoEscape,"Currently in a similar situation, although just with Kratom.

My use spiraled out of control, up to 70 + grams per day, which is extreme.

My prolactin spiked up, my testosterone crashed, and I felt terrible….and the quickest way to feel better was more Kratom.  I couldn’t even get out of bed and do basic tasks without a fresh dose in my system.

My ADHD meds also weren’t working well anymore.  2 hours of energy followed by a brutal crash.  I thought it was tolerance, and that may be part of it, but it was probably also the low testosterone.

I set to take a stimulant tolerance break, and read about 9-me-bc significantly helping repair damage.  As a bonus, it also lowered Prolactin.

Something shocking happened around day 8 of my 9-me-bc cycle.  I got out of bed no problem.  Made breakfast no problem.  Totally forgot about the Kratom.  

Eventually I realized I missed the dose but decided to push it.  I started getting some muscle tension and RLS, which I alleviated with a 2 gram dose (significantly lower than my usual 5-10 gram doses).

I cut my Kratom use by over half that day, down to 30 GPD.  Since then it’s been a week and I’ve maintained this Lower dose, and trying to go lower.

I had no idea the 9-me-bc had anti addictive properties (at least IME) and I’m ecstatic.  Much less desire to vape and Zyn too.

I’ve been making a game with myself to keep getting my Kratom lower and lower.  I weigh every dose, write it down, then total it at the end of the day.

I’ve been pushing myself in other ways.  

Exposing myself to the cold without a jacket is incredibly uncomfortable, but pushing through it gives me a feeling of mental strength.  At first I feel miserable and uncomfortable, but after a while this surge of strength comes up, it almost feels animalistic.

When I’m out running I’ll pick a far away pole or mailbox, and force myself to sprint to it full throttle.  It’s super painful, my body is begging to stop, but my mind overpowers it….. and let me tell you it proves to yourself how much mental strength you really have.

Be creative in ways you can push your mental strength.

skytouching,"Agmatine is helpful but personally I’m on the ass end of a kratom taper right now going from upwards of an ounce daily at peak but on it for five years. And it’s honestly just taken some patience and discomfort. I personally wouldn’t switch to a synthetic drug. 
My taper routine is to cut dose in half and try and make it four hours before redose but I’ve found that a redose at even two hours eventually over a couple to a few days I can make it to four hours with minimal discomfort.  And I’ve basically been doing that till I’m on about 2-3 grams if not maybe less and am working on dose spacing I’m passed physical discomfort and really down to no diarrhea but overactive bowels.

It’s taken commitment, patience, and most importantly not being hard on myself for not being able to stick to the routine. Just be patient with yourself and if you slip don’t get down and say I can’t do this might as well get just get high. Just say it’s all good and try and get back to it.
And agmatine has helped with the restless legs muscle discomfort.

CryptoEscape,"Well said.  And nothing gives comfort like opioids.  Then they raise your prolactin and lower your testosterone, which makes you crave more comfort (I.e. more opioids), causing a viscous cycle.

While Kratom helped me got off harder addictions, I’m starting to realize I lost a lot of my life to it also, even if I was functioning on it (which made it easy to convince myself it was ok)

And maybe Kratom is ok if you’re ok with mediocrity, or if you have chronic pain and need it.  

I still believe it should be legal, but it’s not as harmless as people believe… losing your ambition is a big price to pay , and the years can just pass you by. 

Even with my dosage cut In half I find it easier to push myself into discomfort.  It’s invigorating now,  Sitting around isn’t so comfortable any more.  I get mad at myself
