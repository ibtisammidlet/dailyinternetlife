Legitimate_Banana512,"Are muscle spasms and heart palpitations not quite a normal thing to experience 

But yea you can try.

Altough everychem just realised a new nootropic that agonises those receptors without being addictive",1700866328,kamhojk,t3_182yv97,t3_182yv97,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"There’s a method to quitting nicotine. Part of this is not replacing it with anything, really try and stray from caffeine or anything coming off it or you will just replace it, unless you drink coffee anyway. 

It’s a mindset game. 99% of nicotine withdrawal is mental, your body is just adjusting to having cortisol again and no insta dopamine. If you get your head around it quitting nicotine is a lot easier. Good luck :)",1700853914,kaln2hf,t3_182yv97,t3_182yv97,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
VariationWeary6063,"Get some Cytisine...partial nicotinic agonist.

It's called a lot of things: desmoxan, tabex.

1 month treatment is 30 bucks.

Makes withdrawals minimal,  phase 3 trials showed up to 30% abstinence rate at 12 weeks.  Almost triple success compares to going cold turkey.",1700854279,kalnywg,t3_182yv97,t3_182yv97,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"If your withdrawals are that severe I don’t think a nicotine patch at least low dose. You might wanna talk to a doctor.

But I doubt diphenhydramine would help at least in the way you’re describing. It’s a muscarinic antagonist. I’d avoid that.

Agmatine might help your symptoms its also a nicotonic antagonist but I don’t know how practically relevant that would be.
But it’s helpful with fast heart rate and a general relaxation that may help the muscles.
It also helps alcoholics with the shakes.

But I’d consider talking to a doctor or trying a taper with a patch.",1701181178,kb49tr4,t3_182yv97,t3_182yv97,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
faker4872,Nac and agmatine sulfate are the only things that helped me get off nicotine. 1200 mg of NAC first thing in the morning with 1000 mg of agmatine at night. It really made it surprisingly for me to get off when I was using zyn daily for 3 years. Whether it will help with your symptoms is up in the air but it's worth trying.,1704319450,kg6tdw6,t3_182yv97,t3_182yv97,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
