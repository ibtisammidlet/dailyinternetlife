&#x200B;

I'm currently on Nardil (phenelzine) for social anxiety & depression. It has been great for depression and the ""dread"" side of the social anxiety. I still have breakthrough social anxiety--physical and mental symptoms in situations like interviews (mind kinda going blank) and an overactive fight-or-flight, easy to startle/jumpy, etc. I think my norepinephrine response is fucked up lol. That's what led me to Guanfacine. If you ready on its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine), there's info on there about its anxiolytic properties: ""It appears to work by activating the α2A receptors in the brain, thereby decreasing [sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system) activity.""

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was reading up on Guanfacine more because my doctor prescribed it to me. A couple of Reddit threads pinged my attention:

1. [This thread basically said after 2 weeks-1 month Guanfacine changes into increasing norepeniphrine and thus Guanfacine is NOT a good anti-anxiety medication after the short term:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ut7mza/an_unofficial_guide_to_intuniv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)""You'll see anxiety reduction as a function of confidence and energy, NOT as a decrease in sympathetic activity; the latter is just a temporary side effect, and you're better off seeking out medications that intend to do this primarily.""

&#x200B;

2. [This recent comment on here says Guanfacine can be good for anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/180zaon/comment/kackvhk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): ""While it's true that guanfacine can inhibit NE release (this contributes to side effects like sleepiness), the beneficial effects on anxiety are due in large part to enhanced NE signaling in PFC.

This is due to guanfacine's agonism of alpha-2A, which is a primarily postsynaptic subtype of the alpha-2 receptor. Alpha-2A receptors are expressed in PFC and by activating them, guanfacine can enhance working memory and attention. Additionally, the PFC connects to the amygdala and inhibits its fear responses""

>Can someone help me understand whether Guanfacine is good for anxiety?

The first reddit thread kinda scared me--I don't really think I need more norepinephrine in my brain lol. I really don't understand all of the pharmacological/scientific stuff (but I'm trying to learn it).

I'm over this addiction and I want out of it. What's the best nootropics I can take to get me through WDs? Is it okay to cold turkey? I'm taking around 40 grams of kratom a day. I'm going to buy some pregabalin and clonidine, I've seen studies about them helping opioid withdrawal. What else should I get? I can get pretty much any non scheduled medication,  and almost any RC if any of those might help. I've thought about buying dipyanone since it's an analogue of methadone and lasts like 2 days but I don't want to risk just getting addicted to that.
So please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even from you, Sirsadalot ;)

Edit:
Thank you to all who replied with advice, I'm going to purchase alot of the things recommended to me here tomorrow and will be stopping the opioids when it all arrives.
I genuinely appreciate you all, and you have made me feel as though I really am going to be able to get through this
 Thank you again, much love.",False,t5_4aoxhu,I need help,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/183fp6c/i_need_help/
