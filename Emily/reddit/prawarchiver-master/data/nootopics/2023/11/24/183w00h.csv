Legitimate_Banana512,">:""You'll see anxiety reduction as a function of confidence and energy, NOT as a decrease in sympathetic activity; the latter is just a temporary side effect, and you're better off seeking out medications that intend to do this primarily.""

That is BS. Its about dopamine and norephedrine being not too high and not too low. If your norepinephrine tends to be too high than guanfacine will fine tune it to be a bit lower.

Besides that, even though it lowers norepinephrine, it does also activate a type of norepinephrine itself (2a).

**Functional selectivity(->Contextual Fear Memory):**  
But for anxiety, clonidine paired with therapy is better. This is because of functional selectivity. Its specific functional selectivity makes clonidine be a key to open up the possibility to conciously reconfigure contextual fear memory. _Very useful with ptsd and other disease-states, where sufferers lack that inate ability_:

Im gonna do ask if I can get Clonidine prescribed to work as a catalyst for my EMDR therapy

**Partial vs Full agonism of a2a, and comborid effects with Agmatines allosteric modification:**  

-***Full agonism(guanfacine):*** Artificial bias inducer on norepinephrine release.    
-***Partial agonism(clonidine):*** Impacted most by endegenous feedback of norepinephrine.    
-***Allosteric modulation:*** Can enhance the effects of endegenous norepinephrine and partial agonism. 

***Thus optimally, you can use Clonidine, with its prefered functional selectivity. And combine it with Agmatine, to induce an artificial bias on norepinephrine release, while also enhancing endegenous feedback. Fine tuned to your needs.*** And a low dose of Agmatine can be used to reduce the effects of inhibition by guanfacine as needed, if clonidine is not available.

Dopamine needs to be balanced, not too high, partly because it affects a2a, prevents it from working. in adhd probably more so than normal people:   
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9578002/

(Think of; the impact of clever timing a2a agonists before any d4 agonists(stimulants, endogenous rise in morning); using not too much of any d4 agonists; and of using d4 partial _ant_agonism)

Arsdivine,"I will warn you that trying to understand exact mechanisms of why some compound will or will not work for a particular psychological condition in a particular person is, at the current moment, a futile task. I will just say that Guanfacine significantly helped me with anxiety concomitant to PTSD. It is not a magic bullet, but the side effects are relatively minimal compared to the benefit (A little sleepiness, a paradoxical reduction in REM sleep that should be minimal, as well as blood pressure lowering). The most noticeable side effect is that it may make you more irritable. Guanfacine is more selective than clonidine and generally has fewer side effects.

The best way I can describe it is that Guanfacine helps calm the bodily response to anxiety significantly. It does not do as much for the psychological part of anxiety, but if you experience anxiety that triggers a panicked response in the body that, in turn, potentiates the anxiety, Guanfacine may help you. I would not recommend it to people who do not experience as many bodily symptoms of anxiety.",1701049200,kax2b5g,t3_183w00h,t3_183w00h,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Arsdivine,"I started at 1mg once a day in the morning and eventually moved to 2mg. I prefer morning administration because you get the acute anxiolytic effect during the day, and the drowsiness went away when I took it consistently at the same time for some number of days. I have not tried higher doses. I have a friend who takes 4-5mg a day for ADHD, so the dosage seems pretty variable on how it affects you and what you can tolerate. It definitely has a stronger effect for the first week or two, but your brain adapts to it and it has fewer side effects, but perhaps a little less anxiety reduction as well. It also improves focus if you have ADHD and is approved as an ADHD medication.

I do not take any other medications for anxiety at the moment. Guanfacine doesn't affect your personality as much as traditional antidepressants and anxiolytics, for better or for worse. 

If you have panic attacks, beta blockers are very effective for calming the heart rate and nervousness, but they do even less for the psychological part of anxiety in my experience. I'd describe it as a spectrum from antidepressants/anxiolytics -> alpha 2 agonists -> beta blockers in terms of how much they affect the mental versus the physical aspects of anxiety.",1701591336,kbsiryj,t3_183w00h,t1_kbn7sup,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
