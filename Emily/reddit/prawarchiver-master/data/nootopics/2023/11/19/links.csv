&#x200B;

I battle with chronic depression since more than a decade now and I have just discovered the realm of nootropics. I want to ask you, who are more experienced, to give me some guidance and tell me which substances and protocols might be worth trying!

&#x200B;

So this is my case:

&#x200B;

I am depressed since about 2011. This is characterized by:

\- Low modd

\- Anhedonia

\- Lack of motivation and lots of procrastination

\- Constant feeling of overwhelm and weakness

\- Social aversion and social anxiety

\- Hard time getting up in the morning

\- Day time sleepiness

\- Brain fog, bad concentration

\- Memory issues, especially short term memory -  these got significantly worse since I don't take SSRIs and SNRIs any more

\- Word finding problems

&#x200B;

These symptoms give me a hard time at work. At the moment I try to cover up my bad work performance with unpaid extra hours, but this is a vicious circle, leading to more stress, even less concentration and even more extra hours I have to spend to keep up with my schedule…

&#x200B;

Apart from that I have some chronic physical symptoms that might be related somehow:

\- Hashimoto (Antibodies and inflammation detectable but normal hormone levels)

\- Pancreatic insufficiency which expresses itself in fatty stools

\- Insensitive fingertips and low finger dexterity

\- Hands falling asleep frequently

\- Light tinnitus

\- Chronic nasal congestion, poor sense of smell

&#x200B;

There's no clear reason for my depression. It started in my late 20ies short before graduating from university. I drank alcohol regularily at that time but not excessively. I didn't smoke weed at that time, but I smoked it regularily from my late teens to my mid 20ies. I didn't do any other drugs. There were no traumatic things happening prior to onset.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have been on all kinds of psych meds so far, most of them had rather strong side effects, which made me refrain from them . At the moment I don't take any subscription medication. 

&#x200B;

These are the meds I got subscribed so far and the side-effects they gave me:

\- Sertralin:  restlessness and jittering

\- Quetiapin: made me extremely tired for 12h and more

\- Venlafaxin+Abilify: restlessmess, bad concentration, low libido, UV sensitivity

\- Venlafaxin + Wellbutrin: no records left

\- Venlafaxin alone: improved mood, cognition and motivation, restlessness, excessive sweating

\- Duloxetin:  improved mood, cognition and motivation, indifference, low emotions

\- Milnacipran:  like Duloxetin

\- Brintellix: No effect at all

&#x200B;

I have had several different psychotherapists from different thought schools, none of these therapies improved my wellbeing.

&#x200B;

I've started to take a non-medical approach using nutrition and supplements. I quit drinking alcohol, I only buy organic food and I follow a ketogenic diet (high fat, low carb) mostly consisting of fish, meat, olives, cheese, butter, nut butters and salad. I started the ketogenic diet one month ago and according to the urine tests strips I have been in ketosis every day since. I don't feel much effect from it t, except for my sense of smell which seems to have improved a little bit. I also started a whole-body-hyperthermia protocoll a month ago that includes elongated Sauna-Sessions 1x per week, but without noticeable effect so far.  I also tried microdosing Psilocybin, which didn't improve my mood or cognition, but seemingly makes it easier to access my feelings (aka crying), so i keep taking a microsode every time before going to therapy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Apart from that I am experimenting around with lots of different supplements. At the moment I take an awful lot of supplements, which comes from the bad habit to buy new supplements before using up the previous ones… 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the moment I take the following supplements:

\- Betaine and pepsine - to improve protein digestion

\- Pancreatine - to improve fat digestion

\- Electrolytes:  to support hydration in the ketogenic diet

\- MCT oil: 1 tea spoon to enhance ketone levels

\- Taurine 1g - for improved fat burning to support the ketogenic diet

\- Glutamine 5g: for gut health

\- Acacia powder (Gummi arabicum): 1 table spoon for gut health

\- Vitamin D3 +K2: for mood and immune system

\- Cod liver oil - 1 table spoon - (\~1500 mg DHA, 1000mg EPA) for  mood and cognition

\- Acetyl-L-Carnitin: 2x 500mg - for  mood and cognition

\- Creatine Monohydrate 1x5g: for cognition

\- Huperzine A: 1x 250mcg: for cognition

\- Hericium 2x 650mg - for cognition

\- Cordyceps: 2x 500mg - for energy

\- L-Tyrosin 500 mg- for improved dopamine levels

\- N-Acetyl-L-Cystein (NAC): 1x 800mg  - for detoxofocation

\- Vitamin B Complex - for cognition and detoxification

\- Ashwaganda: 1x200mg for sleep

\- Magnesium: L-Threonat: 1x 1000mg for sleep

&#x200B;

And I take the following suplements sproadically:

\- Tumeric powder

\- Spirulina powder

\- Vitamine C+ zinc

\- Maca Powder

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite using some of the supplements since more than a year now (Omega 3, ALC, Vit D, Tumeric, Magnesium) I didn't notice any positive changes since starting with it.

&#x200B;

The next ones that I want to try are:

\- Spermidin

\- Rhodiola Rosea

\- Alpha GPC

&#x200B;

But I don't expect much from these either

&#x200B;

Since all these attempts didn't get me much further, I want to take my efforts to the next level with some more potent substances - but I really don't know in which direction to look! Is there anything you could recommend me?

Is cycling neccessary, and is taking two choline enhancing supplements ok to do?

I had brain tumor resection in 2019 (now healthy), and original Covid19 in early 2021,  and then I started to feel very foggy in late 2021.  I feel all-around better taking Alpha-GPC.  Happier, less fatique, less brain fog, less drowsiness, more focus.  

Sometimes in the afternoon I'll feel quite fatigued, and then realize that I forgot to take alpha-gpc that day.  It's a big difference.

Could I be better off taking Modafinil, as some in this forum have suggested?  I could ask my neuro-oncologist for a script.  

Thanks in advance!
