CryptoEscape,"So I have very very similar symptoms lately….my life is fine too.

Just getting out of bed takes enormous Will power, as does simple Tasks like making breakfast, laundry, etc.  Life feels unbearable some days, and for no reason

I started using Kratom to manage the symptoms, but it made things much worse….while it provided short term relief, regular use caused high prolactin and low testosterone, so made things worse long term.  

I started 9-me-bc , on day 9 now, and yesterday I noticed something very unusual….I got out of bed no problem.  Made breakfast no problem.  Did things I was supposed to be doing all day without needing enormous Will power.  Kratom dosage cut in half.  

I don’t feel high.  I don’t feel stimulated.  Nor manic.  I just feel….normal.  Like I’m back to life.  Life is interesting again (as it should be)

I’ve been taking 30 mg Sublingual for 15-20 min …this is a bit difficult as it really burns….but I’m so desperate to feel better I didn’t care .  This is significantly more effective than oral IME (tried same dose oral before, noticed nothing after three weeks)

Dreams have been very bizzare.  There’s photosensitivity which is why I waited until the winter to take it.

I’ve been a regular prescription stimulant user too, so my dopamine may have burnt out….9-me-bc seems to restore the functioning and tone of dopamine, without directly releasing much like an agonist (although it does have some MAOI activity, which could cause a direct increase in dopamine, serotonin, etc but it doesn’t feel super strong)

I’ve spent well over $3,000 on nootropics and this has been by far the most effective….this is actually what I was expecting from Nootropics all along

As for psych meds, try Wellbutrin alone or I think in Europe they have reboxetine which might be helpful. We have atomoxetine here which is pretty similar (both primarily NRIs)… they cause anxiety and restlessness at first but once your body adjusts they can be calming and very helpful for ADHD symptoms. After that maybe try getting prescribed MAOIs but get off EVERYTHING if you do—drug-drug interactions are no joke with those. Modafinil also definitely worth a shot if you can get it prescribed.

I think you mentioned Lions Mane somewhere, make sure you get a good extract from fruiting bodies like Real Mushrooms or ND. A good turmeric extract is also important—Longvida is the best I’ve found for cognition, Meriva is great for inflammation.

\- a heavy-duty anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant like Astaxanthin (12mg)  
\- something like Lion's Mane or Noopept for neurogenesis

&#x200B;

I want to make a short wrapup of the recommendations so far:

The most mentioned substances were:

* 4 mentions: Cerebrolysin  / P21 / Cortexin (4 mentions)
* 3 mentions: Kratom,  high dose Psilocybin, Semax / Selank , 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF / Eutropoflavin , polygala tenuifolia, Modafinil
* 2 mentions: dopamine agonists (Macuna Pruriens, Wellbutrin, Revoxetine), Agmatin sulfate, Ketamin, MAOIs, Lion's Mane, ST John's Wort
* 1 mention: 9-me-bc, Emoxypine / Mexidol, Bromantane, Memantine, Astaxanthin, Choline + Inositol, SAMe, Tumeric, Saffron

&#x200B;

Here are my thoughts on these substances:

* Cerebrolysin  and Cortexin are available in Europe and seem to be very save, and from what I understood it is more like a vitamin and doesn't change your brain chemistry, so I am inclined to start with one of these substances...
* Semax / Selank: Similar case. They are available and seem to be very safe. Also something that I could start with...
* Psilocybin is something on the bucket list, I want to do a high dose ceremony with a professional tripsitter in the new year. I want to avoid to go on any prescribed medication like Wellbutrin or an MAOI until then, since it is not recommended to do psilocybin on psych meds and trip sitters are reluctant to work with people who are on psych meds. Are there any other compounds I should be careful with when doing psilocybin?
* Kratom is not an option for me, I am far too scared of the addiction potential.
* Ketamin seems more like an emergency medication than a long term solution to me, so it is nothing I would start with, since I am interested in long term relief....
* 4'-DMA-7,8-DHF / Eutropoflavin: Couldn't find any bad reviews on it and seems to fit my symptoms, so sounds interesting to me
* 9-me-bc: Sounds very interesting to me, since I've read so many outstanding user reports on it. But seems to be unexplored and risky.
* I didn't find the time to research on the other substances yet...

&#x200B;

Recommendations to do outside the realm of nootropics:

* test for hormones levels (thyroid, testosterone) (4x)
* reuce supplements in general (3x)
* remove Ashwaganda from protocol (2x) remove lion's mane from protocol (1)
* test for Sleep apnea (2x)
* test for Mold exposure (2x)

Here are my thoughts on these suggestions: I'm definitely going to see an otolaryngologist for my sinus issues, check if there is a mold infection, and check if there can be anything done to improve my breathing, even surgery, if necessary. I'm also going to look for a private doctor who does hormone checks. I guess that I will need to find a private practitioner, since this is most likely not covered by insurance. I'm also going to cut out Ashwaganda from my supplementation protocol.

Basic theory would often state depression corresponding to serotonin issues - though might be worthwhile taking a few minutes to do that test and look through your results, as there might be some additional insight there along with custom-tailored suggestions.

(Also, this is by no means “advice” or a recommendation, though there’s been alot of promising research on ketamine as being a HIGHLY effectively treatment for depression - not something to do on your own, but may be worth looking into what’s unfolding in that world in professional settings with trained therapists.)",1700771337,kahdlma,t3_17ze0cw,t3_17ze0cw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

On day 8 of the 9-me-bc cycle I noticed I got out of bed easy and without Kratom….my craving for it was significantly reduced.  I cut my morning dose in half and felt fine.  Normally I feel awful and anxious when cutting my dose that much.

Currently down to about 30 grams per day….still a bad habit, but a huge improvement….kinda like cutting down from two packs of cigarettes a day to one…still bad, but much better.

What’s interesting is I’m doing fine on just 30 GPD….last time I tried such a big cut it was unbearable and I couldn’t function, could barely move.

I buy the powder 9-me-bc (not the capsule.). I weigh out 30 mg on a powder plate, then pull my tongue back, and dump the powder into the crevice.  It’s a bit tricky because the powder can stick to the plate.  You gotta really tap it good, and make sure it goes under your tongue (it’s difficult to move it back under your tongue if you miss it.) 

Also try to swallow any saliva before dumping the powder….the longer you hold it the more saliva accumulates.  Eventually it’s like a pool, and it gets harder and harder to hold it the more saliva accumulates.  So clear out any Saliva first.

The first batch burned pretty bad, and was mildly numbing.  The second batch burns mildly, no numbing.  I’m not sure if that’s a sign the second batch is weaker, or if it’s just more pure….or maybe I’m getting used to it.

killword-noot,"MAOIs require special consideration which is why they’re generally not prescribed as first line options. Drug interactions can be deadly but more commonly they just cause unwanted side effects. They also primarily address mood and anxiety (which they’re great for if you have atypical depression) but don’t do much for cognition… NRIs can be great for cognition (almost but not quite as good as traditional stimulants) and have a unique calming effect from adrenergic downregulation. They also have side effects but more manageable than MAOIs. Also you seem to do well with SNRIs like duloxetine—the indifference and low emotions are likely from the SRI part of that.

I think everything would be fine stacked (minus the MAOIs) but I personally would be cautious stacking 4’-dma and Semax or lions mane… 4’-dma is the most stimulating of those three (more like caffeine than amphetamine) and can keep you up if you don’t take it close to when you wake up.
