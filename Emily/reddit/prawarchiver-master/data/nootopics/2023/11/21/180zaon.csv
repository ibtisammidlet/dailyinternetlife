bevatsulfieten,"This is not as simple as you made it for yourself. The sympathetic nervous system is controlled by the HPA axis. 

Trauma at a young age could have made your HPA hyperactive where the slightest issues could stimulate a disproportionate response. Just an example, there other causes, I suggest reading about HPA axis and then taking any substances. 

For instance, Vyvanse will stimulate the adrenals to produce more cortisol; cortisol will make the blood vessels more sensitive to norepinephrine. Vyvanse also works inhibiting the transport proteins for norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. 

Propanolol blocks the action of norepinephrine. 

On the other hand, Guanfacine is α2-receptor agonist, this means that they block the action of norepinephrine. 

Now, what you are doing is trying to mimic the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. 

I think the best course is to look into the HPA axis and hormones. Or maybe just Guafanice, as it may be the better option than β-blockers.

ResearchSlore,"While it's true that guanfacine can inhibit NE release (this contributes to side effects like sleepiness), the beneficial effects on anxiety are due in large part to enhanced NE signaling in PFC.

This is due to guanfacine's agonism of alpha-2A, which is a primarily postsynaptic subtype of the alpha-2 receptor. Alpha-2A receptors are expressed in PFC and by activating them, guanfacine can enhance working memory and attention. Additionally, the PFC connects to the amygdala and inhibits its fear responses.

Amy Arnsten (her lab developed guanfacine) has some great reviews on this as it relates to OP's question

>The amygdala can activate the traditional HPA axis (hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal gland) via projections to the hypothalamus, and the sympathetic nervous system through projections to hypothalamus and brainstem. It can rapidly alter behavior as well, e.g. inducing the freezing response through projections to the peri-aqueductal gray, and increasing the startle response through parallel brainstem projections [\[ref\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289514000101)",1700685715,kackvhk,t3_180zaon,t1_kaalu5e,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Would CBD be a good candidate to inhibit FAAD? Or is it not very potent? (it's opioid activity is actually welcome as I'm tapering kratom)

Are you refering to 5HT2a-antagonists specifically? I've been using olanzapine in low doses the past month @ max. 5mg/day. From what I could gather at these doses it barely binds to dopamine receptors of which it's antagonism is responsible for the bulk of all the nasty side-effects. The only receptor it still does bind to (even better than 5HT2a) is histamine (antagonist). This would produce somnolence and the like afaik, but I actually feel like I have more energy, probably because it reduces my anxiety and hypervigilance, which are huge energy wasters (have a PTSD-diagnosis). I'm also dependent on amphetamine, which might be the reason the histamine- and dopamine-antagonism doesn't seem to be an issue.

Not asking for medical advice, but does olanzapine seem like a good choice for a 5HT2a antagonist in my case or are there better ones around? I also take 10mg escitalopram (down from 20 as I've become pretty reluctant to it's potential for harm, like PSSD/long-term (or even permanent?) serotonergic down regulation/increased activity at certain serotonin receptors which should be blocked or left alone). 

Planning on dropping the escita to 5mg while starting 500mg tryptophan twice daily (did this when dropping down to 10mg as well) as well as trying ND's kanna extract, hoping the VMAT2-agonism will help when dropping AMP completely in the short term in favor of (4F-)MPH as a stepping stone to no stimulants (perhaps 50mg modafinil as a last step).

Potentially better options I found are Nortriptyline (or switching escitalopram out for Amitriptyline), as the NET-inhibition would help dropping stims as well. Other option trazodone? Anything else?

Nortriptyline actually was my primary choice but my psychiatrist seems to be too scared to prescribe anything at all due to my current addictions/dependencies (tapering down Kratom(34gr down from 75), pregabalin (50mg down from 300), baclofen (3x 15mg down from 3x 50), diazepam (5mg down from what was once 30mg years ago)), which isn't her specialty. 

Problem is at this stage in my tapering progress, which I've done gradually over 1.5 years time, I seem to really have stagnated as I basically become completely dysfunctional with general anxiety if I drop my kratom any lower. So much so that I can't even get basic necessities for survival done:  finances, enough groceries, bureaucracy, moving out from my mother again (who's alternating anger and love is a big trauma since childhood) now that I finally have my own permanent residence, requesting exceptions from relevant government agencies so that I can restart my bachelor next year with financial support, after 6 years of having stopped Biomedical Sciences, which I was acing for 2 years before my life fell apart etc.

I only have a script for pregabalin, which was only against RLS from kratom tapering years ago, and escitalopram, from my previous psychiatrist. 
Figuring out the rest on my own, but tell my psych honestly what pharmacotherapy I'm trying. 
After 6 months non-stop GHB use I switched myself on baclofen and have remained abstinent while tapering that down for the past 3 years. 
The olanzapine I buy online, as I couldn't find Nortriptyline, only Amitriptyline but this wasn't an option as I am on escitalopram and officially you have to taper that to 0 and then wait 3 weeks, which seems like it would be counter-effective as kratom withdrawal basically includes SSRI-withdrawal syndrome (seems overly cautious to me though as there's no synergy between SSRI's and tricyclics afaik, just addition). NTP in contrast is often combined with SSRIs.

Would love to try HDACi's like vorinostat, but not sure where to get it yet. Only use bromantane but it's HDAC inhibition is rather weak.

Suffer(ed)from adrenal fatigue + fungal skin infection that got all the way from feet to nose, but combo of pregnenolone, schisandra and ginseng seems to have eradicated it within a week (as long as I keep taking it at least).

Also trialing clonidine 200mcg/day atm which works wonders for the stimulants' side-effects (as well as the adrenal fatigue probably). Is guanfacine much superior to clonidine? I've also read that clonidine/guanfacine come with dependence. Is this a big issue or only in higher doses?

For drug-abuse recovery I got Cere + Cortexin in-stock for IN use. Perhaps NSI a good option to reverse hippocampal atrophy? which pregabalin could even directly induce or worsen by directly blocking excitatory synaptogenesis. It's pure trash for your brain when taken daily...


Sorry for the overload of questions :p They've been piling up haha. Would it be appropriate to make a post for my specific case?
