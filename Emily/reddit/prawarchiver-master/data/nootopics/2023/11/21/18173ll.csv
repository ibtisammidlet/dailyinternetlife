Wise-_-Spirit,I see your logic but increased blood flow also means more flow out of the head. Sometimes pressure is from poor excretion,1700662201,kaausk1,t3_18173ll,t3_18173ll,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

sentics,can you elaborate? what's poor excretion?,1700682346,kacbwk1,t3_18173ll,t1_kaausk1,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Wise-_-Spirit,"Pressure in the head could be due to poor outward flow of waste products via blood vessels or spinal fluid drainage out of the head. So vasodilators could make it better or worse just depends.

Anyways, have you tried antiinflammatories for this? It could be that your actual brain is inflamed. Naproxen is a good OTC one. And there are lots of herbs that reduce inflammation too.",1700682475,kacc947,t3_18173ll,t1_kacbwk1,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
