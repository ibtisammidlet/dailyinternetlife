The anxiety response is one that has evolved for the survival of our species.  An abundance of threats surrounded our ancestors, and so they developed response signals that could respond appropriately. 

Those response signals were passed down to us, modernized, civilized and free from much of the burden that comes from lions, tigers and bears.  

However, modern equivalents to those threats still exist. A challenging interview question, an important presentation, a competition, a performance.  

Many of us have experienced the sympathetic nervous system response during one of these high-pressure situations.  A Fight, Flight and FREEZE response in one of these circumstances can cause one to freeze, fumble, and ultimately fail. 

Specific question:

I have always been the kid who would FREEZE.  Talent shows, class presentations, social situations. under stress, my mind goes BLANK.

I am wondering if anyone has experience using any substance specifically to attenuate the excessive sympathetic nervous system response in these situations, and potentially avoid the neurochemical dump that results in the Fight, flight, or in my case; FREEZE response. 

Background information:

I take 30mg vyvanse for performance enhancement (never abused, no adverse effects, copious bountiful positive effects) and 50mg trazadone for sleep (started during a stressful bout of insomnia, has improved lately and considering tapering). 

I am currently suffering from long covid - of which the most significant symptom is ""brain fog""

I have experimented with propranolol for the sympathetic attenuation and found some benefit, however with some adverse effects (light headed, low blood pressure)

I am considering adding guanfacine to my stack for the aformentioned purpose.

Does anyone have any recommendations or insights into this lifelong problem so many of us face?

Much appreciated<3

When i take dopaminergic substances like mucuna or wellbutrin i get really anxious and can't sleep, but when i take low dose antipsychotics which is increases specifically dopamine in the synapse i feel good. So... the main take away is that i want to enjoy dopaminergic substances without the noradrenaline effects. I also have c-ptsd so that could explain why I'm sensitive to it.

Is it even possible to stop the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline to an extent?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Noradrenaline hypersensitivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/180fl5f/noradrenaline_hypersensitivity/
