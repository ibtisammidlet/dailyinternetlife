kinderstander,"Not sure about the half life, but itâ€™s definitely <24 hours. I have been taking it for > 6 months with no tolerance, but I make sure to give breaks over the weekend and whenever I can to avoid tolerance build up (plus, I only take the recommended dose).",1700620536,ka8yvur,t3_180wxtk,t3_180wxtk,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"I don't seem to get any tolerance to Tak, neither does my girlfriend (who takes it more often than me).
Tak has an antidepressant effect and is a real good nootropic, even if it's something you won't feel acutely (like you can feel something like Phenylpiracetam or Modafinil).
Tak is comparable to something like Noopept, but...just better in my opinion.


It's something you'll only really notice when you work/learn and get more efficient. (Same thing with PRL-8-53 with memory: you don't notice until you are in a demanding task)",1700723008,kaet5r4,t3_180wxtk,t3_180wxtk,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
