WouldYouCalmDown,"Wellbutrin is mainly a NRI, not a dri. So it's first mechanism is increasing norepinephrine.
You haven't stated how much mucuna you take, or if you take it with food, which both make a very large difference.
You can't really dictate off 2 substances that this is specifically what you need, especially when 1 of them is well defined to do what you don't want to happen, 

Given you said antipsychotics help you feel better, it would well show that you need less dopamine, and not more. Since antipsychotics work by reducing systemic dopamine activity (mainly on d2 type receptors), what makes you think you need more? 

Excess dopamine will cause anxiety in anyone pending the pathway. Either via excess reduction in serotonin, or excess catabolism to norepinephrine.

To answer the end, the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine is called dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), which uses copper and vitamin C as co-factors. And the enzyme responsible for converting norepinephrine to epinephrine is PNMT, utilizing methly groups for cofaftors. Trust me it's simpler and more easy to search if I leave it that vague about PNMT instead of typing it all out.",1700602406,ka7r3km,t3_180fl5f,t3_180fl5f,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

WouldYouCalmDown,You would be correct. Wellbutrin is mainly an NRI and nACh7 antagonist. The affinity for the dopamine transporter is very low and generally irrelevant at all but the highest doses.,1700602535,ka7rgcy,t3_180fl5f,t1_ka5i342,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
zasura,Disagree on the antipsychotic part. I take very low doses which is increasing dopamine. Since low doses block presynaptic d2 which manages the reuptake of dopamine so its net increase in dopamine until you take higher doses then its a full blockade,1700609780,ka8a318,t3_180fl5f,t1_ka7r3km,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

WouldYouCalmDown,"Yes, low dose of atypicals such as abilify or vraylar will increase dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex without lowering activity in the midbrain, at doses lower than what are prescribed by doctors. Such as under 2.5mg of Abilify. But this effect takes roughly 2 weeks given the time needed to desensitize D2s receptors. So any immediate effect you receive from them before that is due to reduction in dopamine activity. 

But again, you have not provided any information as to which antipsychotic you have taken. Given even the atypicals have other mechanisms of action such as 5ht2a antagonism, 5ht1a agonism, a1 antagonism, h1 antagonism, etc.

Also, D2s receptors don't manage the reuptake as they are not transporters. They just signal to slow/reduce the release of dopamine",1700610321,ka8bdgc,t3_180fl5f,t1_ka8a318,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
