Nine_9er,"Yeah, I Noticed the same issue, only I was still tired after, it had almost zero effect when I didn’t get enough sleep. Then again I might be a non-responder in general to this compound, as I didn’t feel like it enhanced the dexidrine I normally take. Any effect was extremely subtle.",1699568179,k8kbjmk,t3_17ro0i1,t3_17ro0i1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
dthornberg,I get a very strong stimulant effect from it even when tired. I usually take PPAP when I’m at a rave and need a pick me up around 1 or 2 for more hard dancing. It hits me like a freight train during the day though so I might just be a strong responder.,1699588886,k8lpbdy,t3_17ro0i1,t3_17ro0i1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
ResearchSlore,"I've only tried PPAP up to 50mg, but even as someone quite sensitive to stimulants, it's pretty subtle. Still, the evidence suggests that PPAP increases impulse-dependent catecholamine release, so it might have less effect as norepinephrine neuron firing rate decreases, which the below paper suggests happens in quiet waking.

They remained totally silent during both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical (or rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep.

Hxmusa,I’m the same. Sometimes it’s too damn strong. My jaw started swinging at work at around the 4 hour mark and this is at a 40mg dose along with Guanfacine lmao,1699602667,k8mbxlu,t3_17ro0i1,t1_k8lpbdy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
That_Bullfrog7696,"That makes sense, so since it's essentially amplifying then if the initial signal is lower the end result with amplification will be lower?",1699605513,k8mfm6q,t3_17ro0i1,t1_k8kogfm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
That_Bullfrog7696,"Like an alternative to newmind? Yea, not sure if I can share sources here, but its a European nootropics company. I ordered multiple times in the past with quite a strong effect from it, I'm not sure if it's me or a bad lot.",1699605366,k8mffk0,t3_17ro0i1,t1_k8m8a1h,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"I’ve wanted to try it since I first saw it on newmind I sent them and science the same application and science accepted my application and new mind declined and I have more than any of the basically rc stims or serotonergics just wanted to try ppap and the deprenyl or selegeline analog they had.

But ppap honestly seems like it has the potential to create better habits along with mindfulness and self control by releasing more dopamine when doing something that would normally be slightly mundane and over time not necessarily become enjoyable but a habit requiring less self motivation. That’s been my theory forever idk how it is in practice.

But yeah ? I haven’t ordered European noots besides cosmic but in my experience with quite a few us based companies once you find one with a legitimate product I’ve never gotten boned. But it’s possible. Nootropics in general can also work great and then all of the sudden just stop I’ve had that experience with quite a few different nootropics but idk…
Tbh I’d still be willing to take a shot can I dm you?",1699610350,k8mlia5,t3_17ro0i1,t1_k8mffk0,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
