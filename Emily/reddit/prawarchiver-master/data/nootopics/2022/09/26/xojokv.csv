sirsadalot,"The project so far has been a complete success in my case. Not only did it increase my IQ by 7 points, and my friend's by 6, I genuinely feel I am smarter being on this compound, and I've been making a lot of progressive, intuitive decisions. I've become more health focused, and it's almost as though it originates from a more introspective mindset. Sometimes I catch myself thinking more from a third person point of view, and my consciousness in general feels elevated.

A caveat here I'd like to mention is that I did not get any of these effects immediately, besides the increased IQ and working memory increase. It 100% works, but it's not acute. And normally with drugs you expect something to just *kick in*, but in my case there isn't a forward psychoactive effect like a ""high"" by any means. Others have reported the opposite, but this is my personal experience with the compound.

It will be back in about two weeks. Maybe a little longer. But it's something I'm very proud to have brought into the forefront of our community. And thanks for the tremendous support I've had along the way that made it possible.",1664206821,ipzdr49,t3_xojokv,t3_xojokv,33,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"Observations so far:

- This is something you notice rather than feel

- I laugh harder and more often

- I feel like I can articulate my thoughts better

- When attending math lectures, I can understand concepts more quickly and then go on to apply those concepts more quickly. Beforehand, I would need to become familiar with a concept before I could start abstract reasoning around it, but this process has been shortened.

- I'm more introspective. It shows itself as an ability to peer deeper. I just seem to be able to answer more introspective questions with a greater certainty that I was before. Paired with the previous point I made, it allows for a lot more introspective progress to be made in a shorter time.

- I've noticed a lot more that I simply remember certain things more easily. Before, I would need to recall the context of a fact before I could be certain of it. Like needing to remember *where* I read something. Now it's like, I can recall the name of a band, actor, or whatever, and I just know it's right. That knowledge appears out of nowhere and I don't even remember where I remember it from.

That's what I've noticed so far. The experience has been positive overall and I'll probably by more just from the boost to introspection.",1664314949,iq5qlmj,t3_xojokv,t3_xojokv,20,False,t5_4aoxhu
WorldAdditional4214,"It has been great. My IQ went up 6 points. I experienced improved reaction time and informational processing which led in to thoughts regarding time perception. I also feel increased mindfulness and introspection, which led to questioning some of the actions throughout my life and understanding myself as a person more clearly. My mood has been great, colors appear a bit more vibrant, and my workouts have been great. I feel more aggressive and explosive at the weights. The effects peak in about 2 hours and last all day. It tends to become a bit overstimulating, and I experience a bit of hypomania if I go to 3mg or above. Therefore my favorite dose is 2mg as it avoids those sides.
