now that that’s out of the way, i wanted to ask for those who are more educated and informed on these compounds, if there would be any contraindications or dangerous interactions with my next planned upcoming stack to help with anhedonia/depression that i think may be dopamine related, as SSRIs and other serotogenic substances have either done nothing for me or actively made me worse (complete apathy/emotional numbness). the planned stack is for 3 weeks:

9-me-bc -15mg sublingual //
bromantane - 2 nasal sprays //
piracetam - 5 grams //
alpha gpc - 150mg //
l-tyrosine - 500mg //
CBD isolate - 35mg //
agmatine sulfate - 1 gram 2x per day //
tropisetron - 0.25ml

idk how important it is, but prescribed i also take gabapentin 400mg 3x per day (yes i know the dangers of this, i am very careful & taking it as prescribed under a physician’s care), & clonidine 0.2mg (altho i may go back to 0.1 as i find 0.2 often makes me extremely drowsy and unmotivated).

i also take vitamin c, vitamin d3/k2, magnesium glycinate, zinc, high dose myo-inositol, astaxanthin, white willow bark, and a high EPA formulation fish oils.

any advice, recommendations, or warnings here?? the overall goal is to combat severe depression, social anxiety, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation. pharmaceutical interventions for the most part have failed me & i’m incredibly desperate.

oh also another potential idea i had in replacement of bromantane in this stack was selegiline patches (under a physician’s care ofc). the idea behind this is to potentially combat some of the alleged neurotoxic effects of 9-me-bc’s converted metabolites. but i’m unsure of interactions as they’re both MAOIs. thanks!!!",False,t5_4aoxhu,9-ME-BC & Bromantane together?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/x72e9u/9mebc_bromantane_together/
