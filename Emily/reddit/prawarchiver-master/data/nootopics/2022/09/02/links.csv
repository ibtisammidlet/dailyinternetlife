As you can see in this website they are not at the top of income or education expenditure per inhabitant so I don't think those are the main causes. I was thinking maybe it is because they consume lots of fish which provides DHA. I also read that obesity is less prevalent among Asians. What do you think? Can it be something about their diet?
