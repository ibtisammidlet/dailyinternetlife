I think I have hypoactive nmdaR's - but at the same time, excess glutamate (maybe the high bilirubin from my Gilbert's syndrome has something to do with that). Bad brain fog, bad working memory and LTP is also in the gutter (fasoracetam works wonders for me). 

Supplementing with glycine, either in the form of mag bisglycinate, or glycine on it's own, has been a revelation. Super clear head and it feels very dopaminergic. However, I get super tired from it. Anything upwards of 150mg's of glycine and I'm a walking hyperactive zombie. But once the lethargy goes away, I feel extra. Apparently, for some reason, I'm really sensitive to the Glycine's inhibiting potential. I can't imagine how people take, for instance, 5g's before meals, or 3g's before sleep. I'm dead the next day, if I take an additional 1g of glycine with the 1000mg's mag glycinate that I take now every night ... I also get crazy dreams from it. So it's pretty safe to say that I get a strong potentiation of nmda currents - together with strong inhibition in the cerebral spine neurons.

So, as I really like the positive effects of glycine, but obviously, can't live with it's negative effects, I was thinking, would D-Serine be similar, but without the negative inhibition that Glycine has? 

Is there anybody here that has tried both?

So I was wondering what effect neurogenesis/neuroplasticity enhancers would have on this if any. My intuition tells me it should help reinforce bromantane's effect on the brain but behavior not drugs would probably be the more important element of the equation. 

Additionally would that also mean that taking dopamine downregulators like stimulants with NG/NP promoters could reinforce the downregulation?

Or is that not how any of this works at all?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Would taking drugs that increase plasticity/neurotrophic factors at the same time as Bromantane help consolidate or ""lock in"" the dopamine upregulating effects neurologically?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/xen50y/would_taking_drugs_that_increase/

I have noticed 25mg or 1 spray gives me a slight sense of calmness but no motivation or focus that I was hoping for.
