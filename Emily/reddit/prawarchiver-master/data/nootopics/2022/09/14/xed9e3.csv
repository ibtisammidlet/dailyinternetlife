Heavy-Reference-9509,"I believe less is better
One or two sprays of the nasal spray first thing in the morning works best for me and taking at least one or two days off per week",1663208403,ioha12x,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"Yes happens to me when I take too much, I knock straight out for a bit and feel weird. You’re probably sensitive to it like me and only need a little.

Skip your second dose and take it every other day if possible or test it out taking it daily.

Also I’m sure the spray is 9mg/spray?",1663189679,iog4iqm,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,"Yep, when I take too much for sure, otherwise its sedating for max an hour and then energizing.",1663198379,iognyis,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
User_Pigbot,"I had the same issue when I first started taking it, so I stopped. Then I started again, and I don't get it anymore.",1663194242,iogf2aq,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Niskeus,Pretty the same for me...sublingual or intranasal I get no motivation boost or better focus/mood with bromantane :( :( i was hoping for a better mood/boost :(,1663229861,ioi7td9,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MentalNeedleworker27,I did a quick Google search because this has me puzzled. I guess drowsiness is a possible side effect. I'd half the dose or add mucuna puriens,1663251725,ioj8gcg,t3_xed9e3,t3_xed9e3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

scarbony,"Yeah i have been skipping second dose, but even first dose or one spray doesn’t give the motivation/stimulant effects that most people talk about.

Yes, the spray is 9mg per spray. u/sirsadalot mentions one spray nasal is equivalent to 25mg sublingual.",1663190314,iog61tg,t3_xed9e3,t1_iog4iqm,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"It's not equivalent because the pharmacokinetics are drastically improved via intranasal. How much exactly is unclear.

Instead of doing sublingual, just quit that and do 2 sprays",1663198317,iogntp6,t3_xed9e3,t1_iog61tg,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,Do you drink caffeine with it? For me 2 sprays with caffeine and protein rich healthy food does the trick,1663195711,iogi8pb,t3_xed9e3,t1_iog61tg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

scarbony,"Now that I have the nasal spray I have been only doing sprays, but two sprays seem to have the same effect of 50mg sub which is sedating.",1663198474,iogo5tl,t3_xed9e3,t1_iogntp6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
RealReview2770,Why did you never get back to me after I sent you pictures of one bottle having less than the other? I also stated what you sold me was a scam. I felt nothing. Where is my refund?,1663266730,iokb20v,t3_xed9e3,t1_iogntp6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,Or maybe just use drugs that don't suck instead of dirty dinosaur molecules that cause serious problems as opposed to micro dosing a toxin every 2 weeks so you don't fuck yourself up...,1663297160,ioma2um,t3_xed9e3,t1_iom9imt,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,I don't recall you sending me an image of one bottle having less than the other. But sure send me an image here and I can give a response.,1663275130,iokweug,t3_xed9e3,t1_iokb20v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
