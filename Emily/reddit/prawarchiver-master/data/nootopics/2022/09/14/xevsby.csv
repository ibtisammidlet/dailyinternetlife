Switch_23,"Interesting. So it's probably overstimulating you, but by that account, D-Serine should be similarly anxiogenic. Although their binding affinity's towards NMDAR glun1 and 3 subunits is defined by the type of glun2 subunit. So maybe this is inclined more in favor towards glycine in you.

Khronosgod,"I cant recall why theblow dose of glycine was better, but i think it has to do with too much glycine and that it causes a rebound effect, So it made me  feel like I had a lot of glutamate, hence anxious.
