Whatever_acc,Imo I'd rather find selegiline as it's not in RC category and is well studied,1662488654,incfzye,t3_x6os3f,t3_x6os3f,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,Rasagiline has the least neurotoxic metabolites and then Selegiline has slightly more. All the fluoro derivatives have worse neurotoxic metabolites.,1662416554,in8nlba,t3_x6os3f,t3_x6os3f,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

WikiSummarizerBot,"**[Para-Chloroamphetamine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-Chloroamphetamine)** 
 
 >para-Chloroamphetamine (PCA), also known as 4-chloroamphetamine (4-CA), is a substituted amphetamine and monoamine releaser similar to MDMA, but with substantially higher neurotoxicity, thought to be due to the unrestrained release of both serotonin and dopamine by a metabolite. It is used as a neurotoxin by neurobiologists to selectively kill serotonergic neurons for research purposes, in the same way that 6-hydroxydopamine is used to kill dopaminergic neurons.
