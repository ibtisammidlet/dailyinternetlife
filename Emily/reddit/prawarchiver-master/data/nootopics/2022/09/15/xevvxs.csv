XANAXBAR2,"I suppose they do at least suffer desensitization from prolonged daily activation. So then tolerance will be noticed, and you either choose wise and take a break period which i assume will yield relatively quick baseline sensitivity. Or choose to start the one way lane of upping the intake dosage. And like many GPCRs that don't suffer tachyphylaxis, this would be the time where they will downregulate. This will take much longer to reverse, as rebuilding new receptor proteins isn't prioritized in already highly energy intensive neuron cells.

Edit: did not check up on the literature",1663839544,ipg4uyb,t3_xevvxs,t1_ip1k2xy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Switch_23,"Hi, tnx for contributing!

No, nefiracetam is not a gabaA agonist. It does, however, attenuate gaba activity at the gabaa site; if gaba levels are low, it positively attenuates the signal and vice versa if levels are high. It can also increase gaba release, but in no way is it a gabaA agonist ... Idk who wrote that wiki statement ...",1663842424,ipg8h07,t3_xevvxs,t1_ipg4uyb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
XANAXBAR2,Thanks for correcting me. I had no time to check the sources so i shouldn't have mentioned it in the first place.,1663866464,iphpr5b,t3_xevvxs,t1_ipg8h07,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
