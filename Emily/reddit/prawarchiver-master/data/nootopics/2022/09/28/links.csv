They are also rechargeable and basically work like artificial antioxidant enzymes (nanozymes).

I have an initial batch of simple cerium nanoparticles arriving next week, size 2-7nm, not conjugated with anything. Their zeta potential is negative, so they won’t permeate into mitochondria. By default, shouldn’t pass through the blood-brain barrier as well, unless mine is leaky somewhere.

I’m looking for any compounds that could temporarily and reversibly open up my BBB so that they could have a chance to get in. The safety and accessibility of the method are a priority. 

I haven’t started analyzing literature about such a method but thought to ask if anybody would know anything interesting already.

EDIT:
since I have depression, I may already have BBB hyperpermeability: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220803/ however, I shouldn't assume such a thing and still need to find some manual intervention to open it up.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Looking for studies on how to temporarily & reversibly increase permeability of BBB,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/xqd6zr/looking_for_studies_on_how_to_temporarily/
