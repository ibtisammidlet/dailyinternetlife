infrareddit-1,Thanks. Has it affected the effectiveness of the Bromantane?,1667589420,iv2btx3,t3_ym55yz,t1_iv22e9c,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
necromandie,I would also like to know if it has negatively or positively impacted the overall efficacy of the bromantane.,1667591079,iv2fy6y,t3_ym55yz,t1_iv2btx3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
cyclist5000,"Well, I don’t experience much from it anyway so kind of hard for me to be the judge of that LOL. I don’t see how it would make any difference in effectiveness though. If anything, I would think it would work better, because of the nasal passages being more open and possibly reaching more area.",1667592039,iv2icwg,t3_ym55yz,t1_iv2btx3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

necromandie,"I wonder if, due to the vasodilation effects of eucalyptus oil, it would enhance absorption of the solution? Hmmm",1667596300,iv2su0i,t3_ym55yz,t1_iv2idj1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"I would actually expect to have better absorption when my nasal passages are (semi-)closed. Two reasons:

1. It means the nasal mucous membranes are swollen, thus well-blooded(=more absorption) and have more surface area. More surface area = faster absorption.
2. Because they are swollen, the fluids you spray up there can't drain very well. So they keep sitting exactly where they need to be to get absorbed.

I always notice if one of my nostrils is blocked, I get no fluid coming back out my nose or down my throat, without any effort whatsoever, while through the open nostril I feel it running down my throat within seconds.

(I use a spray with capsaicin (the spicy molecule of red pepper), which allows me to feel exactly where the fluid ends up, my throat burns way more than nasal passages)

&#x200B;

Now trying to balance the fluid between your nostrils and throat without losing anything is usually an impossible task. Then I read someone saying they would lay down on their side. Did this for a few weeks, but now I could feel the fluid going down my Eustachian tube...

Fortunately someone else was more inventive: **Lay on your bed with your head hanging down from your mattress (after spraying upright), and gravity does the trick. I do this for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the amount of fluid.** As a bonus you get way more blood-flow to your head and sounds become softer. A moment of peaceful quiet!

How much sprays do you use? I suggest taking more if you don't feel much. Some people take 6 sprays / day (though I would recommend to do 2 - 3 at a time, and redose every 30 mins). The effects build up with the days so that helps as well, peak maybe at 30 days? Higher dosages tend to be more gabaergic.",1667609332,iv3lh5p,t3_ym55yz,t1_iv2idj1,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
