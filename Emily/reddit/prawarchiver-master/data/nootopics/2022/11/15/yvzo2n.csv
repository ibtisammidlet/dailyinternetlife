sirsadalot,"In study 16, they incubated cells with L-Serine, and it produced oxidative stress due to metabolism to D-Serine, although in vivo L-Serine might metabolize into cysteine and other antioxidant compounds. But still, that was only to reference D-Serine itself, and how L-Serine did not protect from its oxidative structure.

In regards to eNMDA, I've basically discovered that antagonizing it is only good for Alzheimer's. eNMDA is necessary for social defeat, and antagonizing it can worsen it (probably why Memantine failed as an antidepressant). In general I've found out more since writing the D-Serine post. 

On the topic of Neboglamine and excitotoxicity, it seems like it's neuroprotective rather, based on what I've read about it. No signs of toxicity are found in the brain or body within dose range. Looks like D-Serine has off-targets besides the NMDA glycine site that cannot be excluded: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9758163/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9758163/)

The study I linked showing D-Serine being excitotoxic in synaptic regions was pretty flawed, and probably not the best example I could have used. And its implications for the safety of NMDA coagonist site enhancement isn't clear, especially because antagonists at the recognition site of NMDA had greater protection than deleting D-Serine. However, this also wasn't with added D-Serine, but with added N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. To disprove the involvement of eNMDA, they used a NR2B antagonist. However, NR2B can translocate between the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions, so they probably should've used gold nanostructured memantine, which has been shown to produce a neuroprotective effect (which also doesn't fit their hypothesis): [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988)

In general there are a lot of other studies demonstrating a stronger role of eNMDA in neurotoxic response, so I think their study has a long way to go if it's to disprove the theory.",1679707969,jdkj6xg,t3_yvzo2n,t1_jdg0vb2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Cappin_The_Turtle,"Here’s a great overview on acteylcholine and depression: https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/mental-illness-the-cholinergic-system.

I don’t think you have to worry about tropisetron. Tropisetron is selective. It just acts as a partial agonist at the a7 nicotinic receptor. Nicotine, which selectively agonizes nicotinic receptors, has been found to be anti-depressant. Further, deletion of the a7 nicotinic receptor has been shown to induce depression in mice. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5099687/ This matches with depressed human genetic data. The a7 receptor has a giant role in combatting neuroinflammation, which partly explains its anti-depressant effects. Due to tropisetron’s selectively and the data around the a7 receptor, tropisetron shouldn’t cause depression even in those sensitive to cholinergics.",1668554778,iwivtwa,t3_yvzo2n,t1_iwi7h8n,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
s0damnb0red,"I wouldn't worry much about that. Tropisetron mainly is a α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, the receptor also being a target of acetylcholine and nicotine.

Pure_Nourishment,"Y'know, I had a terrible time trying to take Wellbutrin once (e.g. poor working memory, word recall, verbal fluency, etc.)- which, to my knowledge, was likely due to its inhibition of nicotinic receptors. That makes me all the more interested in what partially activating that receptor may do for me.

For now, Tak 653 will be tested in isolation. Then I may add bromantane and/or Tropisetron!

sirsadalot,"Hey, thanks. Memantine definitely has its flaws. It antagonizes the a7 nicotinic receptor which is very bad, as well as synaptic NMDA receptors which is also pretty bad. However the relevance of that scales with dose, and in small amounts it probably isn't cognitively impairing, likely due to more antagonism in extrasynaptic regions.",1668579494,iwk8bga,t3_yvzo2n,t1_iwjgu88,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
s0damnb0red,"Interesting.. From what I've read so far Bupropion exhibits the weakest inhibition at the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor (the one tropisetron also acts on), which would also explain why it doesn't affect cognition negatively in healthy people. But of course individual experiences differ, some being drastically different from the majority. I can imagine that the inhibition of the other subtypes of nicotinic ACh receptors caused those issues for you, or the weak inhibition of the alpha-7 nAChR already caused you issues. Would love to learn more about this. TAK-653 is also amazing! I'm currently using Piracetam for that purpose.
