jsjames2017,"I ordered Tabernanthe Manii hoping to experience increased energy, clarity etc. After reading up on how great it was I ordered it. Started with one drop. Then went to 3 drops, then tried 10 drops, finally as a last try I did the whole stopper full, probably about 15 drops. Got absolutely nothing from it. Apparently a non responder. My credit card responded though lol",1668876748,iwzpvzp,t3_yn9gpu,t3_yn9gpu,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

jsjames2017,I think it varies from person to person. I did read a lot of good reviews on it and the product was professionally packaged and sent promptly. I just think I have a high tolerance.,1668890377,ix0lvg6,t3_yn9gpu,t3_yn9gpu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
abe2600,"I hadn’t seen any positive reports on it prior to taking it. The information and studies I’ve found don’t reveal much. 

It is very subtle, but did you measure precisely on a scale? Like I said, the thing I noticed most distinctly was a “coming up” feeling reminiscent of other broadly similar compounds, and I only tried it once so I think there’s a high likelihood this was a placebo effect. I will try 50 mg again soon to see if it is consistent.",1668878216,iwzt9ry,t3_yn9gpu,t1_iwzpvzp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Extrinsik,"Might help to know some psychiatric background. This substance was developed to combat substance abuse. If you have no issues with this it may be difficult to notice any benefits. On the other hand, if you have a little ADHD or depression and reading is typically difficult, then this is a valuable anecdote.",1670626154,izl9z7a,t3_yn9gpu,t1_iwzt9ry,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Designer_Custard9008,Not for bromantane or tropisetron. Beyond that I don't know. It sounds like maybe tabernantholog would go well with colouracetam.,1684704652,jl2tyzb,t3_yn9gpu,t1_jl2trte,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
