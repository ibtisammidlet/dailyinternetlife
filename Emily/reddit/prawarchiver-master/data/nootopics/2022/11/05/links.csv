ROA sublingual/oral: some grains are slightly larger though soft. Didn't take anything else or eat anything. Just coffee and water. Within about 15 minutes felt an energized, ""coming up"" feeling, though possibly placebo it was very strong, but never transformed into anything too unusual. Thinking was normal, perhaps a bit more articulate than normal. Did some reading and had no difficulty with processing ideas. Went outside several hours later and colors did seem brighter, trees and houses seemed more interesting and patterns more noticeable, but nothing dramatic and again very subjective. Conversation with companion was also normal. Finally ate about 9 hours later. Still felt bright energetic feeling. 

Wondering if there is any info on human trials. Also wondering if there are other experiences, and if it makes sense to use time in any particular way: meditating, writing, reflecting, socializing, exercising etc.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tabernanthalog,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yn9gpu/tabernanthalog/
