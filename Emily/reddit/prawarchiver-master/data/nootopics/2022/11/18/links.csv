*It's not scheduled in the US*, that's why it's mostly used in studies as 5ht2-a agonist, however, there was a proposal in 2022 to schedule it, which may not yet be enacted and we'd also need to check if it's not prohibited in your state, but this can probably easily be answered by the vendor.

Cannot order it myself as they sell to registered companies with deliveries to business addresses. Not interested in other 5ht2-a agonists.
