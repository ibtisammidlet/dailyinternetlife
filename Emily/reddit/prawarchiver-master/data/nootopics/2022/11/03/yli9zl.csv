GeneralDelay812,"I made a thread about my order but its been deleted for some reason, I have tried to make contact via the contact form on the website but had no response at all.

My order also arrived completely smashed, the packaging really isnt suitable to send something 4000 miles away, just a thin flimsy envelope with thinnest layer of bubble wrap.

I am very disappointed and would like either a replacement that is packaged properly or my money back.

I dont know why my thread was deleted or my emails are being ignored as they were both very polite.",1670781019,izt64hp,t3_yli9zl,t3_yli9zl,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Well I just placed an order of bromantane off of the new site everychem.com

Never received a confirmation email about order through email. I hope it’s shipped Monday and no later. If shipping gets dragged out I’m just going to start making my own nasal sprays, buy Caprylic Acid (or another MCT oil, empty nasal spray bottles, bromantane powder. Do some easy math

PabloAnnie,"Someone did. Sirsad made a good post in r/Nootropics with well elaborated science, and a small announcement launching [bro.co](https://bro.co). Then he's immediately banned? Without any reasoning whatsoever? Which rule did he break? Why are comments mentioning [bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co) removed, but not other vendors?

Possibly related or completely not, just wanted to bring this datapoint to this sub's attention: I remember that somebody asked MYASD if he would consider selling bromantane. MYASD replied that he wanted to, **""but the bank just wouldn't let us""**.

Which always struck me as strange? Why not allow him to sell a compound with over 50 years of excellent safety data and no addictive qualities or other side-effects (and isn't restricted in any way)? What does the bank care about that, it's not like it would bring a risk of lawsuits. They sell other russian noots that can be VERY addictive, like phenibut...

Yes bromantane is banned by some sports organizations because it improves athletic performance under cold conditions, but phenylpiracetam is banned much more generally and is sold by Nootropics Depot (well not now that the world seems to have eaten all the PP :( )

Could it be that interests are not against Sirsad per se, but against bromantane becoming popular? Someone working on a patentable analog? A CFS drug? Wild speculation I know, but anyone can think of a reason for Nootropics Depot's bank to refuse specifically bromantane?I have no knowledge of how banks operate when dealing with medium-level companies.
