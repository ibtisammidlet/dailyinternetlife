Bobtropics,"I'm a non responder to it, even in high doses, some ppl like it though. But it's not anything like regular PP if you ask me.",1667566616,iv0rai3,t3_yluhw7,t3_yluhw7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
spushkin1,"It’s inferior to the regular Phenylpiracetam. The direct stimulation is not nearly as noticeable, the motivation boost is non existent. In my experience as least.",1667571515,iv12769,t3_yluhw7,t3_yluhw7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Trexxm7,"There's a source on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) if you perform the drug search, not sure if we are able to post links on reddit. I ran a Google Search and found old sources of the drug.",1667582218,iv1tac0,t3_yluhw7,t3_yluhw7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Trexxm7,"I also ran a search on [google.com](https://google.com) in English with 'phenylpiracetam buy' and there were at least 4 websites selling the product. I used Piracetam in a range of dosage ranges from 100mg-4g daily around time of my early 20s. I had exposure to antipsychotic medications, usually in the form of injectable forms in the hospital. I found Piracetam to be useful before, and shortly after time of antipsychotics. I have used a few others of the racetams available online. I may state that Piracetam is indeed one of the weaker ones, yet it was effective and useful within the context of my use. I used doses in the range of 2-4g daily, a source of choline was used to avoid the headaches that are caused from Piracetam.",1667584766,iv2013k,t3_yluhw7,t3_yluhw7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Trexxm7,"Reports indicate that users have different effects; some of the other derivatives are more stimulating, slightly psychedelic, which I found Piracetamerhaps above the range of 2g. I'm not aware of your preference and needs and wants from the medication however I do carry supply of Piracetam with me at times.

In the past, I found that it was effective for respiration and verbal fluency and did promote augmentation of the visual perceptions and a sense of well-being and health as I used it as a moderate detox agent and promoted the color of the urine and urine quality. I used it mostly from a doping perspective without a strong indication, but a source of reasonable consumption throughout the day. I have used upwards to 2-4 daily without complaint, and do recommend that you be aware of possible headaches that do come from higher dosages of the drug or related drugs. Apparently they claim Piracetam-related drugs will deplete choline from within the brain, and I have used the citrate, bitartrate, and the CDP Choline, alone with phospholipid (PC, PS) compounds which were also useful. I have used PS alone with a moderate mineral profile which did promote organization and enhanced and visual-active visual perceptions. I have noted that the 'psychoactive' from Piracetam were not as strong as they once were when I was younger, and the form from the pharmacy is about 800mg tablets which I make my usual consumption 400mg, else headache does form without the choline or suitable remedy from use of these Piracetam typed drugs. It may not be the most potent form, but effects from 2-4g orally with a supplemented choline source were positive without complaint with cross-domain transfer remarks, even my motor function was improved following use of Piracetam. So find what works best for you and look into posts and forum material by other members who have used the drug, 

&#x200B;

For me, I did not abuse the other forms too much due to complaints of concentration or attention, which appears to be the usage indication from many members that use these related drugs. I also had positive effects on mental reaction fluid thinking, visual enhancement; I also found that I did have positive effects of the urological system when usin larger amounts, and did not have medical or mental related complaints. I also had more emotional response, was more active within time and place, and found it effective as  source of consumption without negative complaint, adjustive use of choline was used despite bitter taste and issue with oral consumption. Overall, I do recommend Piracetam for use from both medicinal perspective but also a source of recreational consumption. A lot of please improvement within the cognitive domains following short and long term use, and also medical research has shown the drugs to be very effective within the cells and other biochemical and phycological functions within both humans and animals. The indication for Piracetam is also very broad depending on damage, personal issues, and the need or want of the drug, it's even used for people whom have ischemic stroke so it is an effective medication and other Piracetam-typed drugs are even more 'potent. So find what works for you to be honest.

I do recommend it as positive consumption, and i personally used it following antipsychotic intoxication in my early 20s when I had a medical malpractice, personal injury incident.",1667585795,iv22odm,t3_yluhw7,t3_yluhw7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"I would try to get Phenyl from rupharma or cosmic nootropic. I personally haven’t tried their phenyl, but apparently it’s the original Russian stuff on the market.",1667619455,iv454zv,t3_yluhw7,t1_iv1sd15,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,Very similar to phenylpiracetam ( racemic ). p-cl-phenylpiracetam is stronger. The strongest version of phenylpiracetam is probably pure r-phenylpiracetam which is one of isomers of racemic phenylpiracetam available on the market. Animal studies indicate that this isomer is more active one and mostly responsible for nootropic and stimulant effects of phenylpiracetam.,1667624132,iv4cp18,t3_yluhw7,t1_iv3qh57,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"No idea, but I can tell you Cosmic is 100% legit. Been with them since the beginning. I also need PP. Didn't think about Cosmic, but pill forms of these powders are always mad expensive. It's 50$ for 30 pills of 100mg, and I used to take 200mg, twice daily.  


Anyone know exactly why there's no PP anymore? How come they can make PP hydrazide, but they can't make PP?",1667611583,iv3q308,t3_yluhw7,t1_iv2jx4k,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Snoo-14803,"Whole package means all 30 pills inside nanotropil. I remember last year having phenyl from euro nootropics, that shit lifted my mood, strength, lowered anxiety, improved focus everything as it should. This one now didnt do absolutely anything, caffeine is amphetamine for nanotropil. (The reason why i didnt order again from euro nootropics is bcuy they are always out of stock and kinda unserious).",1667633083,iv4nq8x,t3_yluhw7,t1_iv2jx4k,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
