SenseOfScience,"If you lower your dose to 90mg a day you can at least know that your dose is the same as an FDA approved drug (45mg twice a day as prescribed in combination with bupropion) if that has any value to you from a safety standpoint.  In fact bupropion slows the metabolism of DXM so it is somewhat comparable to taking a higher dose. To what specific degree is difficult to say, but I think this a reasonably safe treatment option as long as as you are aware of the potential for interactions with other medications. Particularly as it concerns serotonin syndrome.

Fluffysugarlumps,"I love taking dxm here and there. It does more than just mess with NDMA. I take 90 mg here and there and it really turns me into a kid again. Just happy, full of wonder, belly laughing at simple things. I’ve tried other dissociative drugs and they help but not to the extend as dxm does. I’ve been messing with it for 18 years. Tripped on it a lot in my younger years and always cherished the afterglow more than the high.

The third one especially has profound and rapid motivational and activating effect but tolerance develops unbelievably fast. Amantadine works quite rapidly too.

throwawayIn5days,"Yea I know the dosage is slightly higher than upper tolerable limit for steady dosing,
However I do not notice the antagonistic reducing effects until I break 100mg,

Ie after a week or two of dosing and abstaining from substances, at even 90mg I hardly notice a benefit when caffeine or others are reintroduced,

But even 120mg daily will offer benefit.

I have abused dxm as an adolescent, and I’m not quite sure if that could of gave me permatolerance.

throwawayIn5days,"For me memantine has pretty bad side effects. Horrible insomnia and I even notice this like jittery anxiousness.

Dxm is the only of its kind I have responded well that I’ve tried.

I don’t notice much for agmatines antagonistic effects or magnesium (both obviously leagues weaker in effect)

The other substances you mentioned seem intriguing, I may look further into them.

My question for the ha-966 is if tolerance develops rapidly,

Does this have other downstream effects? Is it just tolerance to specifically that substance, or the aspect of antagonizing the NMDA receptor?

If so, I’d believe I wouldn’t like to risk it as I like to go on breaks from anything that pushes dopamine and just take an antagonist to clear things",1667925017,ivkbpkf,t3_yjmtbf,t1_iv4da4y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheMostStableGenius,"It’s complicated.

“Mechanistically, antagonist-mediated blocking of NMDA receptor (hypofunctioning) leads to the excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate and acetylcholine) in different brain regions, which in turn causes hyperstimulation of postsynaptic neurons and subsequent induction of psychotic conditions.”",1667351464,iupcqgd,t3_yjmtbf,t1_iupbeaw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

CryptoEscape,"That’s interesting, I’ve always wondered how NMDA antagonism in general affects the brain (as opposed to specific NMDA antagonists)

Magnesium seems to be calming.

Agmatine I read mixed reviews, some people say it’s calming; some people say it’s stimulating.  For me I notice nothing from it.

DXM, PCP and Memantine feels speedy to me.  Ketamine though I sit back and chill.  

But I don’t quite understand NMDA antagonism in general, or really the function of NMDA.

On the flip side what would agonism of NMDA feel like?",1667391761,iur27l2,t3_yjmtbf,t1_iupcqgd,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
