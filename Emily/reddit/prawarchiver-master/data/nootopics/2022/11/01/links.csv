I had reached a point where my new normal was lower, and I new I needed a reset. I forced myself off caffeine and anything dopamine related (I would occasionally use things like Kratom/ sabroxy for the push to dopamine, but always cycled and I never developed a tolerance to any single substance)

 I began dosing upper normal ranges of dxm for its affects on NMDA, around 100-140mg at night or sometimes I’d move that night dose to mid day.

I’ve been playing around with it, and I never feel high or anything but I just feel *better*

More in tune with my senses, more grounded, more *real* and when I had cycled off everything for several weeks, I caught myself greatly enjoying life again. Laughing at minute things, belly laughing and enjoying things. 


It took some getting used too, as my energy output took a hit. Mind you I felt terrible for a couple days from caffeine withdrawal and just not having that “thing” to push me through my more intense work.

2 months later, I’m back to some nootropics and hitting plateaus performance wise again, and when I dosed I again notice dxm always levels me out.. gives me more passion for life and improves my mood on top of adding this *realness* to my perception.


I believe I don’t have the typical neurochemistry already from some past things however, what could be causing dxm to be therapeutic to me? Purely just clearing those receptors of calcium influx, etc?


How long could this go on without being problematic? I know of lesions in mice models, however I believe that was at 4-5 times my dose (human equivalent)

Could I perhaps need a longer flush/ abstaining from dopamine release and clearing out NMDA?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Mid doses of dxm make me feel better,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yjmtbf/mid_doses_of_dxm_make_me_feel_better/
