financeben,"Just as an FYI, there’s intranasal testosterone. This is also shown to be way less suppressive bc of (I think) very short half life. I don’t know but I would theorize mental benefits are better.",1668909748,ix1rphi,t3_yzgxhh,t3_yzgxhh,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
DodoMachine69,"I'm on 175mg test E weekly. I do half monday and the other half thursday. Been on almost 2 years so far. I would day the mental benefits kick in about 6-8+ weeks. It takes a while for the test ester to saturate. Also it's not a holy shit mood boost, it's real subtle. Like for me, after taking it for 6 months, I looked back on my life and was like ""wow, I didn't feel like this back then."" Effects are subtle and gradual.",1668950511,ix3enk7,t3_yzgxhh,t3_yzgxhh,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"In my experience my libido skyrocketed within 3-4 weeks of starting TRT.   
My experience is only with injectables though, not transdermal.   
Also with testosterone you need to check for estradiol levels, as too much of it can make libido worse.   


> Im low in T(in part due to suboxone treatment for opioid dependance) but just high enough not to get to try it(by one nmol/l) 

If you are being denied TRT for being one nmol/l above the reference, you can always tank your T more before a blood draw. /r/testosterone is probably a better place for this discussion.  

Edit: I ordered Indian pharma selegiline from on online pharmac, to the UK about two months ago. It was shipped from Germany, if it helps.",1668924797,ix2igg6,t3_yzgxhh,t3_yzgxhh,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"I am not familiar with the gel, but for Testosterone Cypionate/Enanthate (long ester) with IM/SubQ injection, I found the mental effects and feeling of well-being really kicked in around week 5.

For shorter esters like Testosterone Propionate, many anecdotally say they felt it kick in as soon as 3 days with the majority saying within 1-2 weeks. I personally noticed it in 1.5 weeks.

Testosterone Suspension would be even faster.",1669302483,ixmb7cg,t3_yzgxhh,t3_yzgxhh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Still interesting if you are not following crypto dramas, but interested in selegiline.

snAp5,I’ve been on T cream for about 2 months. Went from 415 to 1600. Apply on scrotum and you’ll get the perfect metabolite ratios. My E and DHT are perfectly balanced and it feels nice overall. The real results come at about a year.,1669408392,ixrr1vj,t3_yzgxhh,t3_yzgxhh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,This doesn't sound like a bad idea at all. UGLs carry non-esterified T suspended in water. They are usually 50mg/ml. I have nasal spray bottles that deliver 1/8ml at each pump. I would dilute that to 4mg/ml using distilled water. 1 spray would be 0.5mg. I think it would nicely work as a starting point,1668951860,ix3gz6c,t3_yzgxhh,t1_ix1rphi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"I am already on TRT, and I am not planning to use sub-mg doses of test intranasally.   

I was just thinking out loud how I would do it, given that pharma grade intranasal test requires a prescription, and the doses dispensed per pump are probably for TRT and high enough to shutdown the natural production.

On the other hand, I might try sub-mg/mg doses of intranasal Trenbolone.",1669211996,ixhg6km,t3_yzgxhh,t1_ixh8ju4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
