Im low in T(in part due to suboxone treatment for opioid dependance) but just high enough not to get to try it(by one nmol/l) 

I got a month worth of the gel from a friend, 50mg/day, and my question is in the title. I know the risks of self medicating but im completely anhedonic all the time except for 4-5 hours from when i take my 70mg vyvanse in the morning(thank god for these hours tho!)

and my libido is zero, 98-99/100 days, even on vyvanse, so i might as well try it even tho i guess T wont do muchbut who knows.. Would rather start with trying selegiline to replaxe vyvanse but cant find it here in EU..

Information on the inject ones is also very appreciated, thank you!:)",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Testosterone, how long before(mental) effect?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yzgxhh/testosterone_how_long_beforemental_effect/
