snipsnip80,"This is super interesting.. especially because I have very hard time falling asleep. My regular schedule is 2am to 9 or 10 am of sleep. But several times a month I cannot sleep all night. Last 2 nights I was able to only fall asleep at 5 am!

The most hit I see is skin tone and color, and red eyes, and my hair started to grey in past 2 years. 

I take lysine sometimes so will try to take more often to see if there's any difference.

But the most impactful skin booster for me personally, is regular exercise. 

I fell of the bandwagon for several weeks and my skin not only looked tired and gray but also got major acne and dryness.

Then one day recently by mistake and getting caught up with neighbors in convos, I ended up on a 3 hr walk around my village, on a crisp day. 

When I came back, tired as hell, the first thing I noticed, was my face looked beautiful, glowing, clear and eyes revived.

I've been working out twice since then but my skin has improved exponentially just by that one event. 

Last thing that gives immediate reviving effect is a mask made of honey,ot of seaweed powder and a bit of moringa. If I do this even once for 2 days my skin looks lovely. What's in these ingredients?",1667412898,iush34i,t3_yk9mgu,t3_yk9mgu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Don't know but look into TCA peels (YouTube), if you really want to look like you're 20 again :) Skin improvement was not my goal at all, just a side effect.",1667418340,iusvdzk,t3_yk9mgu,t1_iush34i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,At night? But we can also sleep at day. I believe the pulses have something to do with deep sleep. The sleep becomes ever shallower as we age.,1667506018,iuxsrtn,t3_yk9mgu,t1_iuwp1og,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,Is that why I get weird blood sugar issues during the day whenever I don't get enough sleep?,1667493042,iuwuq0m,t3_yk9mgu,t1_iuwp1og,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
