,"I’m having the same problem with the site! It says sever not found with a white screen.
I messaged sirsaalot (idk if that is spelled right) with no response.

I’ve been waiting for this day to finally place an order for the bromantane nasal spray. 

I’m debating making my own with the same materials and a few grams of bromantane.
That or just making a sublingual solution using the same principle. I’m just not sure of the bioavailability of sublingual.

Amazon sells the same carrier as bromantane.co for their nasal spray. I was thinking of just buying a few empty nasal spray bottles, then figure out the concentration I need. Then weigh out my materials on a mg scale, and using a 10ml oral syringe to add the carrier solution(the same as bromantane.co uses)",1667509124,iuy104e,t3_ykxchf,t3_ykxchf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Yeah the carrier as in the oil… Caprylic acid is what is used in their bromatane spray!!

You can actually buy a bull container of it on amazon! Then buy how ever many grams of bromatane off any site. As you already know you can just buy spray bottles off Amazon.  It’s just calculating dosage per spray based on total amount of solution and bromatane powder. 

I’m also very sure you could use the same method depending on solubility of substance (water soluble or fat soluble) to make nasal sprays for many nootropics! Same goes with making semax/selank, bpc, and so on by mixing bac water into the vial containing whatever product. Then transferring mixed vial into a nasal spray bottle then calculate dosage per spray.

I’ve recently done this with 4f-mph diluted into bacteriostatic water in a nasal spray bottle which provides 5mg per spray.",1667518116,iuyizgt,t3_ykxchf,t1_iuy8yyh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
