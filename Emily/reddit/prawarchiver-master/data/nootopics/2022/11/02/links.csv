I was thinking about ordering some (ADHD impulse dead now) but the website won’t load for me.

I'm intrigued. Yes, elastin is being synthesized from lysine, but, as we age, not only our skin deteriorates, but also sleep. Does our body need ever more lysine, i.e. it's becoming ever more inefficient in processing whatever lysine we obtain through food, or maybe there's some other connection? Maybe, the ever worsening sleep, as we age, is the reason why we don't utilize lysine as well as we once used to (i.e. bad sleep = bad skin). If you google ""lysine sleep"", you will see that lysine can be used as a sleep aid. Remember, when we were young, we had no problem falling asleep. I once read about a theory, that the ever-worsening sleep is a self-destruct mechanism of our bodies, the every worsening state of our skin is then an indicator of how far this mechanism has progressed.",False,t5_4aoxhu,sleep and skin?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yk9mgu/sleep_and_skin/
