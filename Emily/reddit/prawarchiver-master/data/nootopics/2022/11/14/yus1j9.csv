defenestration01,"Some of these supplements are produced synthetically and are available for IV treatment (vitamin B complex, n-acetyl-cystine) but others are natural products that I would be surprised to see as an IV formulation (fish oil, ginkgo). 

Youâ€™d be lucky or very rich to find the natural ones in a pure enough form to IV. Also youâ€™d be taking quite a few IVs as all these supplements would add up to multiple grams in solution.",1668419057,iwb63gz,t3_yus1j9,t3_yus1j9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Trexxm7,"Yes, several of them. You could probably have an synthesized, pure form of the active, or set of active molecules of the supplements mentioned if an i.v. form isn't made available. The B vitamins, yes, phosphatidylserine, acetyl-l-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, n-acetyl-cysteine. Your physician could weigh the pros and cons of an i.v. route for you personally. The EPA and DHA  could be use in i.v. however oral routes are usually marked for these OTC formulations. But yes, I would not see a contraindication in the systemic route. They may need to be in a different base, stabilized, sterile, form for the systemic route; your doctor would have information for administration of the intravenous route.

The others usually come in powder, or crystalline form, sometimes they are plant based pulvers for example in the capsulated, oral route; normally not the most the most clinically relevant form in the i.v. route.",1668434419,iwbsbs1,t3_yus1j9,t3_yus1j9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
