Careful-Cobbler-8359,Awesome! I'm considering ordering some carnosic acid too but waiting for my last order from 7+ days ago that isn't shipped yet to try some stuff first. Are the website issues resolved? Is this normal?,1669909574,iyi211d,t3_z5m66x,t3_z5m66x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,No it's not good enough. Rosemary oil contains anti androgens and is sissifying. You don't need to worry about weird stuff like that if you just get pure carnosic acid.,1669600969,iy1q4nn,t3_z5m66x,t1_ixx38yk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
