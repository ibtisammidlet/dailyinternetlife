Dbdbmama,"Amazing work. Great to see someone so involved. Just recently learned about your work.   


Assuming reader has a positive view of Methylene Blue.  
For Idebenone, is the action on the electron transport chain similar to MB?  
Idea that came to mind is using both at same time to give the mitochondria a greater abundance of ATP.....or would that be redundant/harmful?  


Directly affecting the mitochondria is most interesting to me. Ever since I learned about ATP.",1669839409,iyei98x,t3_z404cd,t3_z404cd,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Rozeu,"“The increased ATP from Idebenone prolongs excitatory currents from AMPA, which makes it function similarly to ampakine style AMPA PAMs”

sirsadalot,"Hello it looks to me that Methylene Blue works on complex I and complex II. For Idebenone it's mainly complex III. Increased ATP is not always good, it always depends on how much cells can realistically sustain as well as the mechanism by which ATP was increased. As far as the combination of the two is concerned, I am unsure.",1669869814,iyge23l,t3_z404cd,t1_iyei98x,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Idebenone will work in healthy people, but in some instances it can be counter productive and that's reversed by Carnosic acid.

I've tried nothing similar to how Carnosic acid feels but it reminds me of low dose benzos.",1669354116,ixp8osh,t3_z404cd,t1_ixorsh5,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Dbdbmama,I appreciate the response! I was leaning in that direction; I need more exp with MB before even thinking about adding something else that will further increase ATP...but it is interesting the (I+II) / (III) detail I just learned.,1669870087,iygejfj,t3_z404cd,t1_iyge23l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
