So I picked up a bottle of IDRA 21 along with a bottle of TAK-653. I just finished my TAK-653, and am currently waiting for my second shipment to arrive.

In the meanwhile, I was considering giving IDRA-21 a try. All the discussions regarding IDRA date back 5-9 years ago.

The consensus seemed to be that it did not play nice with other compounds and that it has a tendency to cause headaches and turn you into an emotional wreck.

Some individuals seem to respond very well to it, but the majority seem to not recommend or enjoy it.

All these posts are old though. I wanted to reach out to the community and get some new information regarding IDRA-21, interactions, and harm reduction/safety information.

**Would IDRA-21 be problematic with any of these compounds?**

*Bromantane*

*Armodafinil*

*Agmatine*

*Lions Mane*

*Berberine*

*Caffeine*

*Oroxylin A (Sabroxy)*

**Any input or feedback is greatly appreciated!**",False,t5_4aoxhu,IDRA-21,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/z3joo0/idra21/
