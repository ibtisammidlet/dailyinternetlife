Ill_Possible_7740,"I'm new to this whole nootropics thing. The last 6 months I started taking a ton of supplements mostly to protect from Adderall and the crap side effects that have accumulated and dependence.

I bought a bunch of the more experimental drugs and Russian drugs to play around to eventually get off Adderall. Also taking Strattera.

I know a lot of the things mentioned in this and other threads have low doses. I bought a lot of powders, not pills. How do you accurately measure low doses when it comes to powders. From what I have seen on Amazon, the milligram scales are not good at those low single digit and double digit numbers.",1687042558,joiufzb,t3_z3joo0,t3_z3joo0,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Throwaway197844,I have experience on a wide range of doses with IDRA-21 and you hit the nail on the head with the side effects.  Low dose at most every other day is the only way to do it because that 48 hr half life gets you.

Hammau,"One thing I'm curious about is if IDRA-21 will interact with Agmatine. I've taken both, but I don't remember if I've taken them at the same time.

There's a few things you should know about IDRA-21 and Agmatine. Keep in mind, I'm not an expert or scientist. I'm just a guy who reads a lot.

Agmatine activates AMPA receptors [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061850/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061850/) and so does IDRA-21. So they might have a synergistic effect, or I don't know. Maybe both are a little too much. If you try it let me know.

AMPAkines make your neurons more sensitive to the neurotransmitter Glutamate. Too much Glutamate, or sensitivity to it, is a bad thing. It can cause Glutamate excitotoxicity. But Agmatine also protects against Glutamate excitotoxicity. So maybe there is no problem.

Magnesium Threonate does much of the same thing as Agmatine, but has no effect on AMPA receptors, so I think it would have no interaction with IDRA-21 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507254/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507254/)   

Let me know if you test out the stack. IDRA-21 is one of my top 5. I love the stuff. I'm curious to see if it works well in your stack.

spushkin1,"I do now, but I had to make changes with the introduction of Bromantane.

The first two days, I dosed my usual armodafinil dose along with Bromantane and noticed headaches and overstimulation that made me feel paradoxically dysphoric and tired. 

I cut out Armod for two days, and the side effects went away but I noticed I would be very sleepy in my afternoon classes. I gradually reintroduced armodafinil back, starting at 37.5 mg.

I now have it dialed in. I take 150 mg of armodafinil upon awakening. If absolutely necessary, I will redose 37.5 around lunch time. I do not experience side effects with this regiment.

Before starting Bromantane, my dose was 375.5-450 mg daily. Lower doses of both modafinil and armodafinil have never been effective for me. 

For reference, I’ve been using modafinil since 2014 (on and off, with occasional periods of 3+ months off). I’m currently using Armod just because my vendor had a special and I couldn’t refuse the deal.",1669384424,ixqb0wx,t3_z3joo0,t1_ixqa1qq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"I really enjoyed it!

I found /u/sirsadalot suggested dosage of 2 mg to be too low for me. I tried dosages from 2 to 10 mg, with 6-8 mg being the sweet spot for me. Once this next bottle arrives, I will stay at 6 mg daily. I also found at doses above 8 mg per day, it caused irritability and made me somewhat emotionally numb and socially withdrawn. 

It took 2-3 days to be ""noticeable"", but I particularly liked how vivid my dreams were and how refreshed I felt upon awakening. It created a state of clear-mindedness 45-90 minutes after dosing in the morning. I dosed immediately after waking up. Whatever brain fog I may have been experiencing in the morning, TAK-653 alleviated it. I will say, I noticed the intensity of this effect reduced after day 7.

I found it significantly easier to retain information during lectures, especially in Math. I also added 15 mg of PRL-8-53 after establishing a baseline without it, and they were very synergistic together.

My mood improved a lot after 4 days of consecutive dosing. I found it easier to maintain complex conversations (by complex I mean intellectual, deeper conversations rather than ""small talk"" type conversations). I also found myself more patient, able to wait for my turn to speak more so than before.

I didn't notice any significant effect on motivation, effort perception (someone else also discussed this in another thread),  or focus. Memory improved a lot along with mood.

I stacked it with Bromantane Nasal Spray as well, and I enjoyed the two together.

Just for confirmation, you’re referring to Kappa opioid receptors? If so, I am on Vivitrol (Naltrexone Extended-Release Intramuscular Injection) for opioid addiction.

spushkin1,"So I tried today, and I am enjoying it. I initially dozed 2.5 mg orally, waited 1 hour. In the time between, I read that sublingual dosing was superior and I also didn’t notice anything, positive or negative, so I dosed an additional 2.5 mg. 

Went to the shooting range with friends and family, felt good and shot very well. Upon return prior to work, I dosed an additional 5 mg sublingually. 

It’s been 4 hours since, no negative side effects. I was for a brief period slightly snappy and irritable, but I also was in a fasted state. It went away once I ate. 

No issues combining Bromantane, armodafinil, TUDCA, Maca Root, Caffeine, CDP Choline, Beberine, and Phosphatidylserine.
