gnootynoots26,"For me in terms of focus:
1.) Noopept
2.) Fasoracetam
3.) Piracetam

Faso and Noopept Mix really well with each other.",1654807288,ibrxuf8,t3_v8q0at,t3_v8q0at,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Tyler_too_cold,"Fuck strong cholinergics, unless you really need them. This is my strong opinion of all racetams excluding aniracetam. Sorry couldn’t help it",1654811381,ibs737i,t3_v8q0at,t3_v8q0at,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu
dmt267,Noopept definitely. Both for focus and stimulation,1654828220,ibt53kr,t3_v8q0at,t3_v8q0at,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Tyler_too_cold,"Oh they definitely work, but strong cholinergics can induce a long term state of depression by disrupting the balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the striatum. This is why I don’t like strong cholinergics.",1654828957,ibt6jed,t3_v8q0at,t1_ibserda,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
gnootynoots26,He’s most likely talking about how cholinergics can induce deep states of depression. Along with other negative effects.,1654818730,ibsmcnc,t3_v8q0at,t1_ibserda,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Tyler_too_cold,"What you’re missing is that racetams like noopept, piracetam, coluracetam, etc increase muscarinic receptor density or upregulate acetylcholine synthesis or both. If you increase the density too much then it’ll mess up your dopamine levels due to cholinergic overstimulation.",1655168076,ic9u7oh,t3_v8q0at,t1_ic9tr7t,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
