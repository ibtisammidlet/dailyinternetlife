sirsadalot,"**Abstract:** Creatine supplementation has been reported to improve certain aspects of cognitive and psychomotor function in older individuals and in young subjects following 24 and 36 h of sleep deprivation. However, the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in non-sleep deprived young adults have not been assessed with a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests. The primary objective of this study was to examine the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in young adults. Twenty-two subjects (21+/-2 yr) ingested creatine (0.03 g/kg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind placebo-controlled fashion. Subjects completed a battery of neurocognitive tests pre- and post-supplementation, including: simple reaction time (RT), code substitution (CS), code substitution delayed (CSD), logical reasoning symbolic (LRS), mathematical processing (MP), running memory (RM), and Sternberg memory recall (MR). There were no significant effects of group, no significant effects of time, and no significant group by time interactions for RT, CS, CSD, LRS, MP, RM, and MR (all p>0.05), indicating that there were no differences between creatine and placebo supplemented groups at any time. These results suggest that six weeks of creatine supplementation (0.03/g/kg/day) does not improve cognitive processing in non-sleep deprived young adults. Potentially, creatine supplementation only improves cognitive processing and psychomotor performance in individuals who have impaired cognitive processing abilities.",1654380408,ib6svi8,t3_v4z98x,t3_v4z98x,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Could it be through increased ATP conversion?",1654427621,ib8p8pq,t3_v4z98x,t3_v4z98x,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

analXplorer,"Also - it was quite a low dose IMO. The results for the measurements for sure holds statistical significance though.

It was during 6 weeks so the water retention is probably higher than homeostasis - right?",1654427930,ib8plxt,t3_v4z98x,t1_ib8p8pq,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"The dose is about half what had success in the sleep deprivation study. But like you said, there is a scale and sleep deprivation itself changes the outcome with far more significance. Personally I would say this study is of higher quality, despite the unfortunate outcome.

To answer your other question, however, it could be ATP, but also things such as water retention and oxidative stress. Hard to say for sure.",1654429395,ib8rhd4,t3_v4z98x,t1_ib8plxt,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
