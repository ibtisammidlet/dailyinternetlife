Yoshbyte,It might be better in regards to T that you measure your levels and only add extra if needed. Messing with T can have serious negative effects if not done carefully,1655662228,icyw9tc,t3_vg0qrz,t3_vg0qrz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

darkrayrafael,"In my case it's not linked at all, my testosterone levels are really high but my ADHD is still as incapacitating as always.",1655729814,id1yscd,t3_vg0qrz,t3_vg0qrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

External_Leave_1656,"I've been on TRT for about 8 months now for my ADHD and yes my focus, attention and just mental durability has gone up a ton. It's much harder to control than just being on stimulants though. Testosterone just makes me wanna do stupid impulsive shit.",1672270105,j21f2we,t3_vg0qrz,t3_vg0qrz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Adhdeeznuts50,"Contrary to popular opinion, increased testosterone does not cause inflated ego or impulsivity. It’s actually linked to emotional stability.

The idea of crazy people on testosterone comes from people using advanced compounds like tren, which cause reckless behavior.",1655740440,id2kywi,t3_vg0qrz,t1_id0moys,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Switch_23,"u/Adhdeeznuts50 nah, this is wrong. Above doses of trt do cause impulsivity, anxiety, disregulated hpa axis, and further down the line something that neurobiologicaly looks like depression. The only positive thing is that cycling causes motivation to rise. But depending on your neurobiology this may not be helpful if anxiety and impulsivity goes up too much.",1658219614,igr5fpr,t3_vg0qrz,t1_id2kywi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
