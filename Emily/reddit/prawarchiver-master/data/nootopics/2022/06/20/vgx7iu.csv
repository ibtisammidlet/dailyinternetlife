,"I'm wondering if it has as many contraindications as iboga. I've had some iboga extract sitting in my freezer for a couple years now. I'm on Wellbutrin and Vyvanse, so I definitely can't take it, but even if I stopped those, I'd still be worried that it would interact badly with something in my diet or whatever. 

Unfortunately, I'll probably never take it because of the risks of doing it without medical supervision. If I ever have an extra few grand kicking around, I might go to one of the clinics we have here in Canada, though.",1656532749,ie87x5x,t3_vgx7iu,t3_vgx7iu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
