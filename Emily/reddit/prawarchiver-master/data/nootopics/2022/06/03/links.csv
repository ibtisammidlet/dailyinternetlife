I started spraying once in each nostril, every morning for a week. Upped the dose to 3 total sprays each morning. Now I'm back to 2 sprays after a month of using 3 total sprays and I plan on keeping it that way unless I feel I really need an extra spray.

Bromantane nasal spray gave me a huge push to at least be able to function on every day manual tasks that would otherwise be a chore. Simple things such as getting up and taking care of myself, washing dishes, taking out trash, exercising.

It helped me do these things consistently without much hesitation or second thoughts. As opposed to before starting bromantane nasal spray, these simple tasks would be a chore and I would never be consistent.

Bromantane nasal spray has also helped my physical endurance, I haven't lifted weights for many months, neither do I now. I'm attributing this noticeable increase in physical endurance to my cardio exercises on the treadmill and my endurance while biking.

So to recap, Bromantane nasal spray has helped push me to get manual work done. It has also helped my physical endurance.",False,t5_4aoxhu,What bromantane nasal spray has helped me with,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/v464s7/what_bromantane_nasal_spray_has_helped_me_with/
