Armadillo_Resident,"Iâ€™ve been using it for around the same length of time. 

I got it just to use in my rotation of Modafinil, Phenylpiracetam, Aniracetam, since they all work better only used a couple times a week.

I quickly started using it everyday in conjunction with those three and it has been amazing. On Modafinil days I only do two sprays. It levels the experience out and makes the comedown easier. It is just amazing with Phenylpiracetam and Aniracetam. I donâ€™t find the need to redose either later in the day like I usually would because of some brain fog. 

I do lift weights in a somewhat serious way. I have a trainer and program my diet is dialed in. It hasnâ€™t really helped me out on muscle which wouldâ€™ve been a major upside since Iâ€™ve become a slow gainer as Iâ€™ve aged and I just am not ready for TRT. 

It does help my endurance quite a bit though. Iâ€™m rarely fatigued and have had to end my gym sessions before Iâ€™d like to make sure I donâ€™t over train. 

Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™m a lot less bothered by the trivial bullshit of life. Stuff like a girl not texting back or getting cut off in traffic or annoying coworkers bother me a whoooooole lot less than they used to.",1654289513,ib2vs7t,t3_v464s7,t3_v464s7,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"By itself I donâ€™t notice a whole lot of anything. It may give me sliiigghhttllyy more willpower, but definitely not enough to go out and seize the day or anything. Combined with ALCAR I notice more verbal fluency and a slight increase in drive/energy. Combining with l-tyrosine I havenâ€™t noticed any improved benefits from baseline effects I get from bromantane, but when mixing with other dopaminergics it does seem to potentiate it more compared to without it.

My personal favorite combo and where I really noticed bromantane shine the most was combining it with phenylpiracetam, alcar, and l-tyrosine. It was like the smoothest, most functional and natural stimulant feeling Iâ€™ve ever had in my life.

Plus Iâ€™ve noticed bromantane slows the rate at which the stimulant effects of PP build tolerance as it notoriously does very quickly. When taking PP daily alongside bromantane I noticed pretty powerful stimulant effects for around a week and a half before it started to dwindle as opposed to the usual ~3 days by itself.",1654444814,ib9inii,t3_v464s7,t3_v464s7,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Armadillo_Resident,Iâ€™ve found if I take like one or two days off of PP it completely resets my tolerance and Iâ€™m good for another week or two. Without the Bromantane it was like 3-4 days of effectiveness and the same length of time off to reset,1656115461,idmm2w2,t3_v464s7,t1_ib9inii,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

No need to rain on someone's parade. Not everyone reacts in the same way to things.

Edit: Just realized he's in the middle of quitting phenibut after high dose. That's probably causing it.",1654320754,ib4bv53,t3_v464s7,t1_ib42pvz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
