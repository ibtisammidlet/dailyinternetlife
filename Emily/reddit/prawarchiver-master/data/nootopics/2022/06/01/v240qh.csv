GettinWiggyWiddit,"I just got it as well and took for the first time today. I don‚Äôt think I felt anything, or maybe a 5% alertness boost. Will try with 3 total sprays tomorrow!",1654052485,iaqr86j,t3_v240qh,t3_v240qh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"I'm feeling it now, mild but still makes abit of a difference, I didn't take my Dex today, but now after taking Bromantane around 2 hours later it started to have its effects, it makes me fiendish for Dex haha 
I took 4 sprays haha, tommorow I'll do 2 and see what happens.

My father is reacting positively to it and saids it's good, he seems to be very calm and focused, he saids it's better than Armodafinil.

Just gave it to my friend aswell, he's very sensitive to dopamine because the meds he's on, he's bipolar, he's flying, saids it's better than coke and he can't stop moving, he saids he feels so much energy and an urge to move. Could be placebo.

Edit.
Okay probably not a placebo, my friend now saids he's now got a clenching jaw, saids it feels even better than Tianeptine Sodium! He saids how the hell do I find this shit and loves being my guinea pig.

Now he's less talkative saying he's got laser focus.",1654053097,iaqsepk,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqr86j,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
GettinWiggyWiddit,Woah that‚Äôs a big response! I hope to get half that on my dose tomorrow haha ü§ûwas 4 fairly euphoric for you?,1654054271,iaqulfn,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqsepk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,Be careful with your bipolar friend that you're not triggering a manic episode in him,1654104944,iat6otb,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqsepk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"Yer, such a big response! For me it's less euphoric, I just feel very calm and allot of clarity, but just enough Dopamine to make me crave more dopamine haha. I am going to the hot springs now, they also have cold baths, so I'll go in them and see if the norepinephrine and dopamine release I get from cold water will be potentiated. 

I'll be curious to read what happens with you!",1654054607,iaqv746,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqulfn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"He's good! Always am! Not going to give him anything hardcore dopaminergic, just mild things.",1654145617,iavlnpx,t3_v240qh,t1_iat6otb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
GettinWiggyWiddit,Sounds like a good time üëçüèº I‚Äôll be sure to share my day 2 results tomorrow,1654055069,iaqw0sc,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqv746,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"Just came back from the hot springs! It definitely blunted my bodies response to cold water plunges and the ice room(walk in freezer) usually I get a great rush and mood boost from cold water plunges, this time I felt nothing! Definitely helps your body adapt to different environments.",1654070283,iargv8p,t3_v240qh,t1_iaqw0sc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
