IV is feasible route, maybe IN too",1654760533,ibphwn4,t3_v7kjz5,t3_v7kjz5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fizziox,2-methyldihydrexidine what is it? Is it RC that's available?,1654691568,iblo2c5,t3_v7kjz5,t3_v7kjz5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,I can't find it now but I remember an study about using low dose of a Dopamine D1 receptor antagonist to promote D1 receptor upregulation with good results on working memory. I think it could work similar as the studies showing d2 receptor upregulation by using low doses of haloperidol (dopamine d2 receptor antagonist).,1655008463,ic1y3xr,t3_v7kjz5,t3_v7kjz5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

emy_The_Muffin,"I don't think so, in the abstract they said they injected it directly into the PFC, which probably means that the drug might not be orally active (eg it can't pass the BBB or is metabolised to something else). So I think they are just suggesting that targeting the dopamine D1 receptors in the brain might lead to better results than using methylphenidate which is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor I think, and they probably just found a drug that binds to D1 but it might need further engineering to make it orally active, and also make sure that there aren't other side effects (cuz injecting it into the brain doesn't make it spread far into the rest of the body)",1654692076,ibloz8l,t3_v7kjz5,t1_iblo2c5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Fizziox,"Thank you for pointing that out. I think that might actually be worthwhile to research. Do you know any D1 reuptake inhibitors that are orally active ? Maybe with MAO-B inhibitor. That theoretically could be like ayahuasca but for dopamine :D. I know of mixing MAO-B inhibitors with PEA that works this way, while otherwise PEA would be quickly metabolized.",1654734485,ibob8m4,t3_v7kjz5,t1_ibloz8l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
