xMicro,"What’s your goal? It seems to be all over the place, not that that’s a bad thing. Tropisetron might help with focus or motivation, ALCAR too potentially. NACET is related to NAC, which has been shown useful in addiction, OCD, and some other related things.",1655410399,icmg98r,t3_vdlft2,t3_vdlft2,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

I'd highly advise adding Intranasal bromantane if you're trying to upregulate dopamine.",1655613463,icwtji8,t3_vdlft2,t3_vdlft2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"My goals is focus/executive functioning/motivation/energy mentally and physically/mood boost. Hmm yes true, I'm interested in NACET because of its anti oxidant power, I also want to take care of my dopamine system.",1655420873,icn45qg,t3_vdlft2,t1_icmg98r,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"Thankyou I was before adding the intranasal Bromantane, but the Bromantane worked too well for me, I don't know what happend, but I was cycling between Bromantane and Dex, and I was also reducing my Dex consumption aswell, but it made the Dex, the Dopamine release part of Dex, last way too long and then then the next day even if I took my Bromantane I would feel depressed/anxious(probably desensitization of dopamine receptors, I'm not 100% sure exactly)  now I have stopped the Bromantane and the Dex dopamine release is normal and I don't feel depressed or anxious anymore the next day. It's wierd, but Bromantane does work, just not for my current situation.",1655645734,icxy3ze,t3_vdlft2,t1_icwtji8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
