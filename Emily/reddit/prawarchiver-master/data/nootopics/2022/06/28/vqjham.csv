Spirited_Gap7644,They are both great supplements! I’ve heard good things from taking Agmatine at night which would allow for seamless stacking.,1656903474,ierw7ut,t3_vqjham,t3_vqjham,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
DigGroundbreaking744,"Well first of all, where in the world are you finding Bromantane ? I’ve searched as late as last week for it on the web, and everybody I saw was out. 
Could you provide a link or a website to where I can purchase some? I would like to get some and be able to get on here and talk about it’s affects. 
Tks.",1656959200,ieuix1p,t3_vqjham,t3_vqjham,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Taken them together many times and I love it!! They definitely compliment each other and increase overall energy/focus. I’ve noticed if I’ve been taking bromantane for a long time and the effects aren’t as “in your face” so to speak, taking a gram of agmatine twice per day can bring that magic back. Highly recommend.",1659376231,iij9ir9,t3_vqjham,t3_vqjham,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Deep_Key1388,Aren't the two essentially the same thing or very similar? How about Bromantane and sabroxy or coq10?,1656896738,ierk2as,t3_vqjham,t3_vqjham,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
