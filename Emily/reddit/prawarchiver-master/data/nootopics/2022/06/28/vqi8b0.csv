DrBobMaui,"Thanks for this info, it's most interesting! 

I am definitely considering Demoxytocin and wanted to ask about your dosing. You mentioned taking it before bed, do you dose that way ever time or do you sometimes take it earlier in the day?",1656870897,ieq0tdf,t3_vqi8b0,t3_vqi8b0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

DueWillingness6954,I just bought some and it arrives this week!  I can’t wait to try it!  I tried cerebrolysin and it’s going good however I did not get an effect from phenylpiracetam though possibly my adderall and nicotene addiction interfering.,1691506975,jvb3d90,t3_vqi8b0,t3_vqi8b0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"""Orally-administered Oxytocin has been shown to increase putamen responses to facial emotions in humans.[25] Oxytocin administered orally produces different effects on human behaviour and brain function than when given intranasally, possibly due to variations in the molecular transport and binding mechanisms.""",1697092786,k4j37lr,t3_vqi8b0,t3_vqi8b0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

DrBobMaui,"Thanks EchoingSimplicity! Will try to find out more about Demox. My googling seems to affirm it's good but because there were just a couple of references ... well I am still on the fence about.

Hope you're having a great weekend too.",1656884928,ieqwhs0,t3_vqi8b0,t1_ieqf6kf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"In general I avoid anything that develops a serious tolerance, so I think that would be my main concern with this substance. I know that people who have taken regular oxytocin (which you can buy without a prescription) say they develop a bit of a tolerance to it.",1656885170,ieqx114,t3_vqi8b0,t1_ieqwhs0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"More thanks for this! And you sure giving good advice that everyone should heed.

I have been fortunate with tolerance as I seem to be one of those people who are really not affected much by it. But I do low dosing on a 1 day on 3 or more days off schedule and really do well with agmatine sulfate too. I am an ancient aging artifact algorithm at 75 and it seems that low dose noots and psyches are the only things that give me decent energy so I am always on the lookout for anything new that might work in my ""rotation"".",1656885992,ieqytlu,t3_vqi8b0,t1_ieqx114,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,You might want to look into NMN or NR (same thing with slight differences) as those are used for energy and healthy aging. I've heard a lot of people say that they feel much younger on them.,1656888106,ier39m5,t3_vqi8b0,t1_ieqytlu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"I really appreciate you ongoing support and suggestions. I tried both but they didn't seem to do anything, I am still taking so maybe it will build up over time. At least the microdosing is providing some help so I am very thankful for that.

Hope you have a great holiday too my pono friend!",1656944572,ietkffd,t3_vqi8b0,t1_ier39m5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
