My main goal is energy/drive to work on my business that I’m starting up as well as increased libido/gym performance. 

I’ve chosen these two for their more common and obvious effects but also because they seem to be non addictive and not bad for you. I don’t really have any interest in messing with any racetams, amphetamines or anything of the such. 

I’ve heard mixed things about stacking these two together. I’m curious if anyone here has done so before and what were the results? I’ve got them both in the mail right now and haven’t used either so I’m excited to see what you guys think.

Nothing has EVER brought me such rapid results as Uridine 250 mg and DHA 1000 mg has . What’s your experiences with uridine ?
