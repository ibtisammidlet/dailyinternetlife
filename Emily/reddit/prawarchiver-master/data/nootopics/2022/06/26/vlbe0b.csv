Without a doubt, [Cerebrolysin](https://www.cerebrolysin.com/fileadmin/redakteur/Cerebrolysin/PDF/Cerebrolysin/CERE_MoA-Folder_CEREINT032018-5.pdf) (also called 'the king of nootropics') takes the crown when it comes to increasing nerve growth factors. It is clinically proven to significantly heal nerve damage after substance abuse/trauma/etc., but it's a great nootropic overall as well for improving cognition. Its use is often paired with (the less-studied) [Semax](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29798983/), since they work synergistically. The main downside for most people is the IM or SubQ administration.

Other peptides, like ARA-290, BPC-157, TB4, IGF-1 have shown great improvements as well, but most of the data on their 'NGF-increasing properties' are purely anecdotal. For more in-depth info, have a look at r/Peptides.

r/Microdosing psychoactive substances like [Psilocybin, Ketamine, DMT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34565579/) and [LSD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860175/) have been shown to increase neuroplasticity too.

Also, extracts of a fruit called [Ziziphus Jujuba](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5gzvnr/ziziphus_jujuba_stimulated_the_expressions_of_ngf/) has shown very promising results in several studies, along with [other flavonoids](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/gahqk3/invitro_effects_of_various_flavonoids_on_ngf_gdnf/). Sadly, there's a lack of human data on these interesting extracts, as most studies linked are in vitro or in vivo. [Lion's Mane](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33246107/) is worth mentioning as well, but as for most of these oral supplements; they all get outperformed by the compounds/peptides I've mentioned above.

It's needless to say that before even considering taking any of these compounds, it's essential to do your own research and discuss with a professional first.

>what was your path to gain such deep knowledge about this topics, is your degree / career anyhow related to pharma?

First of all, I'm by no means an expert in this field; my knowledge is very surface-level compared to actual experts. It's only recently that I've been digging into [synaptology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/synaptology) and how some compounds influence several synaptic responses.

About a year ago, I 'accidentally' stumbled upon subreddits regarding this field of expertise after searching for remedies for my hairloss and ADD symptoms at the time. The molecular science/research behind the relevant compounds gained my attention, and I've been very involved in it since.

As a result of this sudden obsession, I'll be following a one-year pharmacist course next month. Since I'm still getting my ADD under control, I will be attending med-school (neurochemistry) next year. Thanks for showing interest!

&#x200B;

>do you have any recommendations for acquiring some decent intuition / basic kwnoledge that would allow me to understand the mechanisms of action of this drugs?

Sure! What drugs are you referring to? Nootropics I'm guessing? - Because there are many different branches of pharmacology. Let me know if you're interested in sources for endocrinology/dermatology/trichology/cardiology/dietology as well.

The things that have helped me get more knowledgeable on the MoA's of nootropics are:

* Firstly, learn how a synaps works and what effects certain neurotransmitters have on different kinds of receptors. This info is widely available 
* Looking up studies of the desired compounds on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and look for words like 'agonist', 'antagonist', 'ligand', 'receptor' with the Ctrl+F mode (mostly found in the discussion/conclusion of the study)
* Images like [this](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mechanism-of-action-of-clinically-approved-anti-seizure-drugs-Updated-and-modified-from_fig5_309229655). These have helped me immensely. Visualization helps a lot with understanding. You can look for them on Google Images by adding 'mechanism of action' behind the compound. Sadly, not all noots have a clear visualization image
* Looking through Reddit for threads with knowledgeable people in it, on subs like r/Nootropics, r/NootropicsDepot, r/Nootopics, r/StackAdvice, r/Supplements. It's worth reading scientific breakdown posts/comments from u/sirsadalot and u/MisterYouAreSoDumb as well
* In the case of medical terminology, it's mostly just through experience. Start with the less-medically written studies, and go up in difficulty as you learn on the way. Just Googling terms helps alot

As for nootropics 'influencers', I haven't come across anyone on social media that has wide up-to-date knowledge about nootropics on a cellular level. The closest to an influencer you'll get that's very knowledgeable and has a lot of experience in the field is [David Tomen from NootropicsExpert](https://nootropicsexpert.com/about/). [Leo and Longevity](https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/cerebrolysin) is experienced with nootropics as well, but mainly focuses on general health and genetics.

Turbulent_Zone_5324,"That's hard to say, since the exact mechanisms of NGF and BDNF are still not fully known. 

From what I know, [NGF](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/ngf/) and [IGF-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763060/) are more important in neuron proliferation and development (mostly in the soma of the neuron), while [BDNF](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/bdnf/) also regulates 'synaptic plasticity' on top of that (mostly in the axons and dendrites of the neuron). [GDNF](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32897420/) and [CTNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_neurotrophic_factor) are necessary for the maintenance and development of intercellular neural connections.

So to answer your question; mostly IGF-1 and NGF (but BDNF as well) are responsible for creating new neurons, and BDNF, GDNF and CTNF 'encourage' connections.

That said, you can look up which compounds are more effective at increasing IGF-1/NGF/BDNF/GDNF/CTNF according to your preferences (although most of the compounds I've mentioned increase almost all of them). Unfortunately, the effects of each of these compounds on the human-serum neural growth factors I've mentioned, haven't all been measured/studied (yet). Most studies are only on NGF and/or BDNF. 

Anyway, Cerebrolysin stays the most effective for increasing both the things you've asked. For only 'creating' new neurons, I'd go with IGF-1 analogues. For only 'encouraging' neural connections, I'd go with microdosing (and occasionally macrodosing) psychedelics.

\-Is it more efficacious than Cerebrolysin at increasing growth factors (at a safe dosage)? Its lack of human research isn't helping much. Has someone ever compared the two anecdotally?

\-In what study did cPG increase IGF-1 cerebrally?

Bierak,"""Initially, cyclo-L-prolylglycine (L-CPG) was designedas a peptide prototype of nootropic drug piracetam \[1\]; later it had been identified in rat brain as endogenous neuropeptide \[13\]. It is hypothesized that L-CPG could be a bioactive metabolite of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) produced from its precursor glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), the N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1 \[11\].The pharmacological studies showed that L-CPGin doses of 0.05-1.00 mg/kg produces nootropic \[5\],anxiolytic \[4\], antihypoxic \[6\], and neuroprotective\[8,12\] effects. The neuroprotective activity of thiscyclodipeptide was demonstrated in vitro on variousmodels of neurodegeneration \[7\]. L-CPG is a positivemodulator of glutamate AMPA receptors \[2\], which el-evates BDNF in neuronal cell culture \[3\]. Presumably,this property underlies the mechanism of neurotropicaction of L-CPG. Importantly, L-CPG maintains and/or reset the balance between free and bound forms of IGF-1 by affecting interaction between IGF-1 andIGF-1 binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) \[10\]. It was con-cluded that L-CPG normalizes the function of IGF-1:in case of deficiency of this growth factor, the dipeptide potentiates its activity; in the opposite case, it inhibits the functional performance of IGF-1. In rat model of acute hypoxia—ischemia, single injection of L-CPG restored the density of capillaries (angiogenic ones included) in the hippocampus and striatum. It was assumed that under conditions of reduced IGF-1 level caused by cerebral injury, the protective function of L-CPG consists in the maintenance of IGF-1-induced vascular remodeling. The same study showed that L-CPG did not bind with tyrosine kinase receptor of IGF-1, although some experimental data indicated the possibility of interaction between L-CPG and IGFBP-3 \[10\]. Remembering the potency of L-CPG to elevate BDNF and up-regulate the IGF-1-controlled pathway and MAP/ERK signaling cascade, is seems logical to examine whether this dipeptide has the proliferative activity.""
