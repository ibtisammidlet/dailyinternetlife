Express_Ad_6394,"Tried it for the first time couple hours ago. I took 2 drops sublingually... but as soon as I felt a burning I swallowed it with water.
I've noticed nothing... although I'm not a smoker! Also on empty stomach.
I will give it a try next week with higher dosage.",1677761427,jam6qsi,t3_v8d7nl,t3_v8d7nl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

ozonelayerozone,"u/sirsadalot, what dosage do you recommend for cognitive improvement?

If my math is right, OP's 3 drops = approx 0.15 mL. At 20 mg/mL, that's 3 mg daily dose. Studies like [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014558/) are using 5 mg/day oral for anti-nausea. Is the idea that we should be going significantly higher for cognitive benefit?

thanks in advance",1654883775,ibvrays,t3_v8d7nl,t1_ibsz5yg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Tropisetron is not addictive because it works on different nicotinic receptors. I suggest reading my post about it,1654825239,ibsz97v,t3_v8d7nl,t1_ibrhhim,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
