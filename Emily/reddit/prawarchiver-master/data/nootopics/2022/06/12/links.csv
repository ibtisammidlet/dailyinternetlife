I have been having inconsistent results follow oral use of Cyclazodone despite using it on an empty stomach. On reading the info found on the suppliers site (we all know who) I read the following. 

Cyclazodone could be produced in a convenient therapeutic form such as tablets containing from 1 to 30 mg of active substance, with a particularly advantageous form for oral administration being a gelatin capsule containing 5mg of Cyclazodone deposited onto an ion-exchange resin.[2]

Could anyone explain this to me? Is this a process I could carry out at home to improve my results?
