odder_sea,"This was their response in regards to my noopept solution which sat in a box at room temperature for ~6 months


Our peptide products include an Acetate molecule which acts as a stabilizing agent, making them much hardier than they are in their original form. The bottle label provides the best storage conditions for regular usage, which is to store at ≤4°C, tightly sealed, away from heat, light and moisture. These are the optimal conditions for storage if for example you were using regularly or plan to use entirely within say 2 years. If you planned to keep the product for up to 10 years, then the best storage conditions would be to store at ≤-20°C. Freezing will not degrade the compound, it will prolong it's lifecycle, most compounds in commercial labs are kept under these conditions.

Our peptides are stress tested under conditions of 50°C for 3 weeks to check for degradation, so whilst the optimal storage conditions outlined on the label are applicable to the majority of regular research uses, storing the compound outside of these conditions for a limited period of time will not necessarily mean any degradation has occurred. Take some foods for example, many can be shipped under regular conditions and will not spoil, but it's best to keep them in the fridge when you get them home and if you wish to keep them for a prolonged period of time, you freeze them.

I hope that helps to clarify, please let us know if we can help with anything else.",1655668084,icz90nd,t3_vckzip,t3_vckzip,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
