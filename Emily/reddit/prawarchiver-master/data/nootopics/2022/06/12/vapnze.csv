xMicro,"Synephrine is very benign. What do you have against dopamine or adenosine antagonists? Hydrafinil is less dopaminergic than modafinil but is a more effective wakefulness promoting agent, you could try that. Creatine can have some energizing effects, but it’s also pretty benign. Rhodiola rosea is particularly good for avoiding fatigue from long periods of doing things. Semax isn’t primarily dopaminergic and is stimulating. Racetams and noopept also exist as stimulating agents, and are likely not primarily dopaminergic either (possible exception for phenylpiractam, but it’s not the same feeling as any classical stimulant). 

Just note that anything that works on norepinephrine predominantly (like synephrine or ephedrine) will also interact with dopamine since norepinephrine transporters uptake dopamine too. You can’t really avoid dopamine 100%, since many things will end up causing some downstream dopamine release (including non-dopaminergic stimulants like nicotine).",1655059836,ic47lkw,t3_vapnze,t3_vapnze,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
