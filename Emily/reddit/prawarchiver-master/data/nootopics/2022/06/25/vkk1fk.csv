EchoingSimplicity,"I've taken sublingual freebase. The powder version from when science.bio was still around. I titrated up over the course of a month to 40mg once per day. It's a bit of a hassle because you have to let it sit under your tongue for quite a while. I would always try to dry my mouth out before doing it sublingually so that the saliva wouldn't build up so quickly.

Anyways, I experienced heightened emotions to quite a bit. This was during quarantine which probably wasn't the greatest time to see the effect. I do remember watching my friends play a game that's the equivalent of smash bros on PC, and it was almost too much. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, super tense watching them play and was really invested in it. It was interesting. I also cried at a TV show for the first time in years during that trial.",1656181982,idprzty,t3_vkk1fk,t3_vkk1fk,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,Sublingual for freebase oral for phosphate. If you want phosphate get some from pglchem.,1656197819,idqpl7h,t3_vkk1fk,t3_vkk1fk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Sublingual sounds like a bit of a hassle. The version I'm seeing in the shop uses caprylic acid, wonder if it can be used intranasally like with bromantane. 

Heightened positive emotions as well?",1656182498,idpt430,t3_vkk1fk,t1_idprzty,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"That's definitely something I've been missing. Might have just sold me on it once I figure out RoA. I mean, if sublingual works, any mucus membrane would I think. You said you used it for a month, or you ramped up over a month to 40mg daily and then used it for how long? Dosing morning, night, or doesn't matter?",1656189203,idq7kcp,t3_vkk1fk,t1_idpxibm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

EchoingSimplicity,Ramped up to 40mg a day by the end of a month and then stopped because I didn't buy more. I would suggest morning dosing because it always gave me a weird kind of energy after taking it,1656190267,idq9ut3,t3_vkk1fk,t1_idq7kcp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
