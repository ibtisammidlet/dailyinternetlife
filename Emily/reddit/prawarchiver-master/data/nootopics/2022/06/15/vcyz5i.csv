xMicro,"Ginger is also a potent OTC 5HT3 antagonist. Used as an antiemetic in cancer patients receiving chemo in fact. You could use that to test your theory. Recall vortioxetine, an SRI + 5HT3 antagonist that oddly has the highest incidence of nausea of any SSRI. As you’ve seen, other emetic effects (such as nAChR agonism, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, etc.) can trump the anti-emetic effect of 5HT3 antagonism. This could indeed be due to a lower affinity for 5HT3 over other targets (as is the case of vortioxetine), in which the 5HT3 effects will wear off first, and then unopposed emetic mechanisms could remain.",1655409888,icmfa1z,t3_vcyz5i,t3_vcyz5i,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Weird you got nausea after 8 hours. I believe I read the antiemetic (anti nausea) effect lasted for around 24 hours.,1655318841,ichkuey,t3_vcyz5i,t3_vcyz5i,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

wvkid101,"I’m surprised too to be quite honest. This isn’t my first rodeo with a 5-HT3 antagonist (I was on mirtazapine for half a year), and I never got that side effect. I might end up taking a dose of mirtazapine and seeing how the antiemetic effect tapers off. 

It’s weird in that with tropisetron, I don’t just lose an iron stomach; I gain nausea when I previously had none. Everything I have done the last few weeks has been fairly normal, so I wouldn’t expect it to be causing the nausea. I’ll have to investigate further and get back.

But also remember that I’m just one monkey. Everyone gets affected by everything in a different way… especially since this is a highly regarded drug for antiemetic purposes I would take this with a massive grain of salt as a possible nocebo.",1655320527,ichoxtn,t3_vcyz5i,t1_ichkuey,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
