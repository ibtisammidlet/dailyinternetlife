These are full spectrum extracts minus the volatile fraction which can be collected prior to this process as I describe at the end of the post.

If you have quality leaf material you can easily make an extraction at home. Saturate 70%ethanol by filling a jar with leaves semi-tightly then  pouring the alcohol... Wait for 2 days, use a simple screw press to squeeze out as much solution as possible from the leaves. Evaporate the alcohol and water on gentle heat and you got a resin that's very hard to  manipulate. Mix in 2X the equal amount by weight of powdered sugar, then continue to dry it on non-stick paper in a ventilated oven or dehydrator. 

In the case of lemonbalm (Melissa officinalis) you're left with a bitter sweet ochre powder with a honey-like smell... 1 g of the final extract (300 mg of pure resin) would be the dose used in the studies but if your material is quality it may be as low as 500 mg. My extracts were too strong at these doses.

For Cannabis 95% ethanol is used and Cannabis resins are even more bitter and dark, smell like hash and generally have around 40% cannabinoids depending on the potency of the buds. Chamomile resin smells similar to the Melissa and has similar effects. Tried smoking most of the pure resins, only Cannabis is good tasting, but lemonbalm still works smoked. I tried to do this with Sceletium and it was inactive subL and smoked. You can do the same process with tea leaves, but use water instead of the ethanol. Doing this with common or wild lettuce yields a substance called Lactucarium with sesquiterpene lactones that have sedative effects through adenosine receptor agonism. 

I'd like to do this with Nymphaea caerulea, Nelumbo nucifera, Siberian motherwort, Passiflora incarnata, Sida cordifolia, Salix alba, etc.

You can use this process for most herbs and it can be made very economical if you collect the evaporated alcohol in a distiller and reuse it for  the same and new batches. In that case I would first use the distiller to extract the essential oil (if the plant is aromatic) and then do this process. If you don't use the distiller the essential oil is lost, you are left with only the polyphenols and waxes.

The crude extract can be further extracted with other methods, but I find no reason for this, as they are potent enough in the crude form even for sublingual use.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Making crude herbal extracts - resins of lemonbalm, chamomile, cannabis and more",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/s0olmr/making_crude_herbal_extracts_resins_of_lemonbalm/
