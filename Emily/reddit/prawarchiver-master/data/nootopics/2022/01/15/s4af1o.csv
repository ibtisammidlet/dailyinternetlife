Where do you weigh the risks of total anhedonia for months to years vs these risks?",1650577173,i5o5zwv,t3_s4af1o,t3_s4af1o,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Yes... Green = good, red = bad, and orange = inbetween.

DILI = Drug-induced liver injury

H-HT = Human hepatotoxicity (again, liver damage)

AMES Toxicity = Mutagenic, cancerous potential

FDAMDD = maximum daily dose (kind of irrelevant, so ignore)

Skin sensitization = skin irritation

Carcinogencity = cancer causing potential

Mutagenic potential also predicted on ProTox.

FYI, cancerous predictions are the most accurate with this software.",1642216859,hspwfyk,t3_s4af1o,t3_s4af1o,1,True,t5_4aoxhu

CCC(=O)N1CCN(CC1)C(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2

And I got a bunch of not calculated using the 2nd link... am I doing something wrong?

Thanks sirs!

EDIT: using the 1st link, I got: The rate oral acute toxicity was a red ++, although in the actual studies it was safe. The MCE-18, NR-AR, CL, and BBB penetration were all red. According to the modeling it seems to be a pretty safe drug?",1642218786,hsq0e00,t3_s4af1o,t1_hspzlan,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
