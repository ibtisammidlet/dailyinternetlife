Abstract: Ginger (the rhizome of Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used worldwide for many centuries in cooking and for treatment of several diseases. The main pharmacological properties of ginger include anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, antiarthritic, antiemetic and neuroprotective actions. Recent studies demonstrated that ginger significantly enhances cognitive function in various cognitive disorders as well as in healthy brain. However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the ginger-mediated enhancement of cognition have not yet been studied in normal or diseased brain. In the present study, we assessed the memory-enhancing effects of dried ginger extract (GE) in a model of scopolamine-induced memory deficits and in normal animals by performing a novel object recognition test. We found that GE administration significantly improved the ability of mice to recognize novel objects, indicating improvements in learning and memory. Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanisms of GE-mediated cognitive enhancement, we focused on nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced signaling pathways. NGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis revealed that GE administration led to elevated NGF levels in both the mouse hippocampus and rat glioma C6 cells. GE administration also resulted in phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), as revealed by Western blotting analysis. Neutralization of NGF with a specific NGF antibody inhibited GE-triggered activation of ERK and CREB in the hippocampus. Also, GE treatment significantly increased pre- and postsynaptic markers, synaptophysin and PSD-95, which are related to synapse formation in the brain. These data suggest that GE has a synaptogenic effect via NGF-induced ERK/CREB activation, resulting in memory enhancement.",1641599824,hrpk8lb,t3_ryltfn,t3_ryltfn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

I definitely feel like it helps my digestion and overall gut health. It has significantly reduced stomach aches and cramps that I used to get quite often.",1641631690,hrr9e9w,t3_ryltfn,t3_ryltfn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
gosastgm,"How much ginger powder would one need to achieving results of an extract?
I like go put a tablespoon of organic ginger extract In boiling water and let it steep for a long time 2x 3 times a day
I also saw it raised T levels and that it combines very well with turmeric xD",1641684544,hruascp,t3_ryltfn,t3_ryltfn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

proximate,"Actually, it appears to be powdered ginger root, not technically an extract. I’ve been taking the Nature’s Way ginger root for a while (usually 1.1g once or twice a day). I just like ginger. Always have. I uncap the powder and mix it in with my stack most days as it does a fairly decent job masking the bitter taste of racetams and afinils. 

I used to take it with peppermint to combat nausea back when I was taking kratom regularly. Also, I don’t have a lot of fat on me, and hot foods like ginger and various peppers serve to warm the body up and keep the internal furnace stoked.",1641695792,hrv1ftu,t3_ryltfn,t1_hrq7l9q,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
