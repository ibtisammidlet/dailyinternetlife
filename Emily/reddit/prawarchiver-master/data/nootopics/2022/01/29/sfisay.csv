Epic_GamerOnAcid,"Ik this is a year old but just want to say a nasal spray solution is absolutely more potent mg per mg than insufflating straight powder. Reason being is a spray diffuses across your nasal membranes more easily and provides the drug of choice suspended in liquid which is rapidly absorbed, powder must first come into contact with moisture on your muscous membranes to dissolve the drug and then be absorbed so a spray basically cuts out the middle man and provides a readily absorbable solution. 

In this case it would be especially true for bromantane bc bromantane is a crystalline that is practically insoluble in water which is all that's present in your nasal cavities meaning it will take much much longer to be absorbed if at all(think bromantane sublingually taking 20-30 mins to absorb and still having undissolved crystals in your mouth), by using a bromantane solution supplied via nasal spray over insufflating crystalline you are not only increasing its diffusion due to larger surface area(whereas a crystalline would have significantly less surface area)but are also increasing its rate of absorption because it's suspended in a solution that is readily absorbed by the mucous membranes.",1703094263,ke7gimj,t3_sfisay,t1_huvmr9k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
