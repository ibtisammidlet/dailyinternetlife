If you want a quick summary on Bromantane nasal spray, feel free to watch this youtube video I created on the subject: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA1D-LeiA\_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA1D-LeiA_0).

**Caprylic acid:** Recently I have developed the Bromantane nasal spray, an invention that utilizes a high concentration Bromantane with Caprylic acid, a medium-chain fatty acid that, unlike long-chain fatty acids, [does not pose a threat for Lipoid Pnemonia](https://youtu.be/HN2qWCytSPc). This allows it to be used as a solvent for intranasal use. Additionally, it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral, so rest assured it is sterile.

Since Caprylic acid is lubricating, it won't dry your nose out, therefore it's better than snorting the powder and there's less risk for nasal membrane damage, which could still be an issue despite Bromantane's non-toxic nature.

**Bromantane's bioavailability:** Bromantane has never been used intranasally in studies, but we can reference other things. There is a study on actoprotectors claiming its oral bioavailability is 42% but after thorough investigation, I have found there is no evidence to back this up. Anecdotally, we see that oral always fails and sublingual takes up to 30 minutes. This means another route of administration is more desirable.

Amantadine, Bromantane predecessor, has been investigated for intranasal use in previous studies: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26886345/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26886345/)

>Furthermore, our results have indicated the potential for nose-to-brain delivery of Amantadine, yielding a potentially novel avenue therapeutics delivery route to avoid the blood brain barrier.

Caprylic acid, referenced here as Octanoic acid, is perfectly absorbed intranasally, where there is then a direct route to the brain through the nasal cavity: [Source](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0168365987900897?via%3Dihub). Since it is a small fatty acid, and Bromantane is lipophilic in nature, this perfects the absorption of Bromantane and allows it easy transport to the brain, where there is then far greater effect.

Essentially, Bromantane is perfect for intranasal use, and this explains why it works so well intranasally.

I know this is straight from the horse's mouth, but it has been working great for me and I truly believe in it.
