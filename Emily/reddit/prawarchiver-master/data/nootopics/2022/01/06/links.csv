It was a fine January morning when Swim woke up and took sirsadastack (Bromantane 100mg, Alcar 1g, Piracetam 8g). Swim cooked his daily breakfast of 4 fried eggs, bacon and coffee. While enjoying his breakfast Swim noticed a harsch discussion about Fasoracetam over NooTopics discord server.
 Swim took Fasoracetam before (a month ago) in amount of 100mg daily for adhd benefits. He checked his supplies and found out there was 800mg left.
Swim had nothing important to be done that day and felt he must contribute to nootopics community, so he took 800mg orally and drank a cup of good ol' strong Americano.

Nootropic effect kicked in about 20mins, Swim felt more focus and thought he'd better start doing something so he went with repeating some of his professional topics.

Most pronounced effect was absolute calmness. Though Swim experienced elevated heart rate (about 100bpm) in 30-45 mins, but everything went back to normal 3 hours later. It wasn't disturbing Swim was calm af, too calm if compared to his daily anxiety which he experience daily from longcovid.

He was focused and calm for about 9 hours in total. He did experience little headache (temporal lobe) afterwards, no other side effects noticed. 

Swim is fine and happy.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Fasoracetam megadose (800mg),https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/rxp64i/fasoracetam_megadose_800mg/
