sirsadalot,"It is optimal to use L-Serine, as not only does it function similarly to glycine, it is a rate limited precursor to glycine and provides a plethora of benefits glycine otherwise wouldn't.

TMG and Sarcosine don't have any practical use here, in my opinion. D-Serine, of course, is my nootropic of choice.",1641680237,hru0ay7,t3_rz6yjr,t3_rz6yjr,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheOptimizzzer,So the TLDR is replace glycine with L-serine for sleep and take D-serine during the day as a nootropic as needed?,1641684912,hruboav,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hru0ay7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Yeah, I still recommend taking L serine with D serine at half the dose of D serine, you can always just take more L serine later",1641685096,hruc4o9,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hruboav,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheOptimizzzer,"interesting, thanks!",1641685421,hrucwyr,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hruc4o9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jazzlike_Fan232,Can I use this in a NAC stack instead of glycine.,1642273710,hsstlz8,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hruc4o9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Why not use L Serine?,1642276512,hst0twx,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hsstlz8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jazzlike_Fan232,Rather then NAC?,1642277491,hst39vr,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hst0twx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Dagar_at_work,Exactly. L-Serine is converted to D-serine. We can take L-serine for the benefits from cysteine to glutathione to  d-serine,1642983172,hty97zg,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hst0twx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Correct, L Serine is a precursor to cysteine",1642278485,hst5ry9,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hst39vr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
handsomedanjung,Love the convo around D / L serine. I just wish there here were more anecdotes / testimonials of these positive experiences,1673202273,j3hwrli,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hty97zg,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jazzlike_Fan232,I will try it. Can I also add D Serine how would it be beneficial if I do.,1642284336,hstk17j,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hst5ry9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"I did a post on D-Serine, it explains everything",1642295381,hsualni,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hstk17j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jazzlike_Fan232,Ok interesting indeed. Question I don’t get is that glycine and glutamate are NMDA agonist.? wouldn’t L lysine open more of the channel. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor,1642313424,hsvc8l5,t3_rz6yjr,t1_hsualni,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
