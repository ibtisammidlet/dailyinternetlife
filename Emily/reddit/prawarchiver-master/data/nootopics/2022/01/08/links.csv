Firstly, I find glycine to be anecdotally helpful for sleep/relaxation/rumination. I’ve never tried D-Serine. But the post states that glycine inhibits D-Serine, and D-Serine shows all these promising benefits, so how can I get the best of both worlds? Or is there something else going on here that I haven’t put together?

Secondly, big ask, but can someone with more knowledge than myself compare and contrast Glycine/TMG/Sarcosine and then compare these to D-Serine with regards to use case?

My very limited understanding is that TMG and Sarcosine are both different forms of glycine, and TMG is better taken in the day for energy/methylation, whereas Sarcosine is better at crossing the BBB to affect glutamate levels in the brain.

Lastly, which in your opinion is the best form of glycine, and can it/should it be taken with D-Serine? Or is D-Serine the only one of the four needed?

Thanks!!",False,t5_4aoxhu,D-Serine benefits vs Glycine/TMG/Sarcosine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/rz6yjr/dserine_benefits_vs_glycinetmgsarcosine/
