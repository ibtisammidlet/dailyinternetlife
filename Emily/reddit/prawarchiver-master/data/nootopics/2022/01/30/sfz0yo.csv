,"You can get seeds on amazon and etsy. I am trying to grow this stuff right now actually. Selaginella made me kind of sick but I have been growing it from a korean tea product (The plant is extremly hardy and can last years dry). Astragalus is probably safer than gotu kola but it requires lots of sunlight. There are other plants like Polygala tenuiflora, Picrorhiza kurroa, rhodiola, Turkministan mint, etc. I have used https://crimsonsage.com to some success but my Picrorhiza kurroa seeds are taking a long time to arrive.",1643571025,huw2gsw,t3_sfz0yo,t1_hutqfjq,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
