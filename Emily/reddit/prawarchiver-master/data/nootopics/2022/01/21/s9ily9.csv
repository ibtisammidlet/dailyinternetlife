girlwothnoURL,I enjoyed your D-Serine research u/sirsadalot but Iâ€™m concerned about this and the nephrotoxicity,1642793117,htmz021,t3_s9ily9,t3_s9ily9,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"As expressed, exogenous D-Serine impairs an important mRNA component and precursor to antioxidants: L-Serine. This causes oxidative stress, insulin resistance and more. But in theory, higher exogenous L-Serine saves it.

L-Serine is a super supplement and vital amino acid that is extremely underrated.

This study also used injection which bypasses the liver (and things like DAAO), and it's dose dependent. Some human studies indicate relatively low oral bioavailability of D-Serine in humans, hence the higher doses.

There is another route to ROS and cell damage through extrasynaptic NMDARs, which can be avoided by Magtein.

But D-Serine also has neuroprotective mechanisms. It's not blatantly toxic, there are just safer ways to use it. This applies to many substances. Which is why I feel it's unnecessary to keep rehashing oxidative stress studies when I've already addressed it in great detail.

And as you said, nephrotoxicity seems unlikely in humans based on the most in-depth source evaluating its safety.",1642825557,htp8zd7,t3_s9ily9,t1_hto0pih,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Look man, I appreciate you taking the time to look into D-Serine, but I feel like you're taking this out of proportion.

My view on L-Serine is hypothetical, but it's an extremely likely hypothetical due to the relationship between D- and L- isomers. Even if the oxidative stress caused by D-Serine *wasn't* from L-Serine depletion, L-Serine supplementation would still decrease oxidative stress/ insulin resistance through identical pathways.

There is also nothing showing D-Serine as causing oxidative stress *directly*, we just know that it does lead to that. Which again is almost certainly from L-Serine impairment.

I include a real safety analysis of all the human data on D-Serine and they conclude there was no toxicity or side effects beyond a significant reduction of headaches in the D-Serine group vs. placebo. And they follow it up by saying 8g+ should be standard.

I also wasn't saying substances injected don't eventually pass through the liver, but they aren't degraded before reaching the blood stream by DAO which is found highly in the liver.

Edit: he makes some really good points below, so disregard some of this.",1643406067,humzwh6,t3_s9ily9,t1_huler7p,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"This is such a good point I'm actually going to upvote this comment myself and I love this source: [https://sci-hub.yncjkj.com/10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.036](https://sci-hub.yncjkj.com/10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.036) even though it contradicts some of my projections on L-Serine. I haven't seen this data until now. I may re-evaluate the role of L-Serine, although I speculated in vivo conversion to L-Cysteine (like NAC in the study) and L-Glycine would produce an antioxidant effect. I need to investigate where it happens and how to rule out its use here.

This is indeed evidence that D-Serine is a direct oxidant it appears. Great job, seriously.

Edit: Btw I include magtein because I believe it is rather selective for extrasynaptic NMDARs due to it primarily generating extracellular Magnesium when intracellular Magnesium is saturated (hence why it raises CREB and helps cognitive decline).",1643469749,huq7h6u,t3_s9ily9,t1_hunafsf,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
