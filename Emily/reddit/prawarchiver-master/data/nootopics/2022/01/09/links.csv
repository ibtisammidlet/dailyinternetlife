Based on predictive software, it's showing relatively high toxicity. To an extent, so does GTS-21 when compared to other molecules. But diOHBA is worse.

I think I finally found an experimental drug with some serious potential.

3-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)anabaseine (abbv. diOHBA) is a metabolite of GTS-21 but it has some really unique features.

First of all it appears the ""instatolerance"" phenomenon observed with nicotine agonists of the alpha-7 type can be attributed to a residual inhibition caused by the chemical structure of the drugs themselves. This is a natural negative feedback characteristic of acetylcholine. Believe it or not, it is not partial agonism causing this (which is neuroprotective), so technically you can have your cake and eat it too.

And keep in mind it is not prototypical tolerance that appears to ruin alpha-7 agonists, but desensitization. Given that diOHBA's desensitization is less than that of acetylcholine, it actually has reverse desensitization and will become more potent with repeated exposure.

This means you could reap the alpha-7 derived benefits of nicotine (potent improvements to learning/ memory, anti-inflammation, etc.) without addiction, tolerance, and it may even be a more nootropic compound in itself.

I believe we should, at some point in the future, prioritize a custom synthesis for this compound. I am not sure of the safety, but we might be able to run it through some prediction software or call a favor on someone.
