I just want to say I've never made so many friends and fun times, it has been truly amazing.

Thanks for all the support through this shitty time, let's all stick together.

Clausenamide is basically ""herbal piracetam"". It's a natural AMPAergic and cholinergic nootropic extracted from the fruit tree Clausena Lansium, currently being studied for cognitive decline in China. There is a language barrier, and the Chinese translation spells ""Xanthamide"" or ""Levoxanthamide"" in English, which is likely why not many people know about it.

Seems like it's going through Phase 2 human trials, or may have even passed by this point: [https://www.sohu.com/a/116841490\_464396](https://www.sohu.com/a/116841490_464396)

It's a multimillion dollar drug already: ""At the end of 2005, the Institute of Drugs transferred Levoxanthinamide to Beijing Qilin Tiansheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. at a price of 24 million yuan."" \~3.778 million USD. From what I've read, it was well tolerated.

It shows promise as a nootropic: ""The synthetic single enantiomer Clausenamide could improve Ab induced impairment of spatial discrimination, potentiate basic synaptic transmission and HFS-induced LTP on either anesthetized or freely moving rats, and **increase cortical ChAT activity, hippocampal synapses and Mossy fiber sprouting.** In addition, was 50–100 times more active than the known nootropic drug, Piracetam, and 5–10 times more active than the racemic Clausenamide."":

It being ""more active"" than Piracetam really means nothing special, but ChAT, the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme, being enhanced, is unique. In addition to its neurogenic effects, of course.

The anti-dementia drug candidate, (-)-Clausenamide, improves memory impairment through its multi-target effect: [https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163725816000036?via%3Dihub](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163725816000036?via%3Dihub)

Clausenamide increases thickness of the cerebral cortex and synapses density in the hippocampal CA3 region (like a 10% increase in cortical thickness in mice) and of course improves learning and memory: [https://sci-hub.se/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10286029808039843](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10286029808039843)

As far as synthesizing it, it seems that extracting it from herb is a highly expensive process. There was a multi-step extraction employed from another constituent in this paper, which seemed interesting: [https://sci-hub.se/https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/OB/b901965k](https://sci-hub.se/https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2009/OB/b901965k)

I'm guessing the dose will be around 0.40 - 1.62 mg/kg in a human based on this patent, which also talks about its extraction: [https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/db/71/24b2396ee06c7b/US4879390.pdf](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/db/71/24b2396ee06c7b/US4879390.pdf)",False,t5_4aoxhu,Clausenamide: Herbal Piracetam,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/s7lq9m/clausenamide_herbal_piracetam/
