FrigoCoder,"They most likely noticed the TS-121 group buy, and I guess the Queuine and the Seipapterin group buy did not help either. Alternatively they got fed up with the Advanced Nootropics, RUPharma, and Med Exchange servers, and the CFS/ME server was collateral damage.",1643238828,hud3iwx,t3_s9b6yn,t1_htmjlf8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
FrigoCoder,"I will try to submit an appeal first, maybe they will enable my account. I have CFS since at least a decade ago, which negatively affects all aspects of my life. Like other hopeless patients I also seeked solutions with diet, supplements, and nootropics. However I have always stayed within legal boundaries, I have never touched drugs of abuse, and all of my actions were consistent with Hungarian and US laws. Discord completely lost all nuance in their zeal to continue the pointless war on drugs by Nixon and Reagan, and they greatly fucked over already marginalized innocent people who were seeking solutions. I sincerely hope they will see some nuance and refine their policy, clearly separating drugs of abuse from other stuff.",1643239777,hud5w2j,t3_s9b6yn,t1_hud2tx1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

NooTopics was never shut down which is good news but it means you need to be careful what you associate yourself with on there",1643239016,hud3zr4,t3_s9b6yn,t1_hud3iwx,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

FrigoCoder,Nuance is what they need along with all regulatory bodies. Illegal drugs of abuse are not the same as supplements and nootropics. CFS patients should not suffer just because Nixon and Reagan wanted to punish blacks and hippies.,1643240420,hud7h4s,t3_s9b6yn,t1_hud3zr4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
