sirsadalot,"**Key Results**

In concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1 μM, galantamine did not display direct agonism nor positive modulatory effects at any receptor combination tested. At concentrations from 10 μM and above, galantamine inhibited the activity with a mechanism of action consistent with open‐channel pore blockade at all receptor types.

**Conclusion and Implications**

Based on our data, we conclude that galantamine is not a positive allosteric modulator of α7 or α4β2 receptors, which represent the majority of nACh receptors in mammalian brain.  


This suggests that the pharmacological effects of galantamine in patients are solely the result of AChE inhibition, albeit other non‐nACh receptor mechanisms cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory actions of galantamine at nACh receptors are not likely to be relevant in a clinical context, as it is doubtful that patients would have the free brain concentrations necessary to obtain significant inhibition at nACh receptors.",1641502950,hrjkemx,t3_rxou4w,t3_rxou4w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,Thanks for posting. Interesting. I had not heard that Galantamine was a positive allosteric modulator in the first place. I only knew about its AChE inhibition.,1641503559,hrjm1b7,t3_rxou4w,t3_rxou4w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
