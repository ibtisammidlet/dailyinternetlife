sirsadalot,"**Abstract:** Withdrawal from psychostimulants, including methamphetamine, induces a depressive state associated with lethargy, dysphoria, hyperphagia and psychomotor retardation. Previous work with repeated administration of amphetamine in rats has shown that amphetamine withdrawal produces decreased motivation to work for a non-drug reward, and this withdrawal is reversed by administration of a dopamine partial agonist. The purpose of the present study was to examine decreased motivation to work for a non-drug reward during methamphetamine withdrawal and explore the effects of a dopamine agonist, dopamine partial agonist, and indirect monoamine agonist on methamphetamine withdrawal. During withdrawal from repeated methamphetamine administration, rats showed reduced responding for a sweet solution in a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement, and this effect was significantly more pronounced than previously observed with amphetamine. Repeated systemic treatment with the dopamine partial agonist terguride (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily), the full dopamine agonist ropinirole (1 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily), and acetyl-L-carnitine (60 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.), a compound with a potential antidepressant effect, during methamphetamine withdrawal restored responding for the sweet solution, suggesting that these drugs may represent potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction during the withdrawal phase.",1642314500,hsvdxtc,t3_s55k1y,t3_s55k1y,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
TakingShotsFeelinBP,Countering Amphetamine withdrawal with dopamine agonists doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Amphetamine use would have already downregulated your dopamine receptors/baseline dopamine levels and now you putting on a temporary bandaid with those agonists. What happens after you abstain from those dopamine agonists? I'm not sure you'd be in a much better place. What makes sense to me for recovery from dopaminergic drugs is embracing the dopamine crash that naturally follows which in turn should lead to up regulation of dopamine receptors and its synthesis eventually.,1642318266,hsvjh4p,t3_s55k1y,t3_s55k1y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

TakingShotsFeelinBP,"Aight, but they only gave the rats a cocktail of all three substances together right? If that‘s true, the study doesn’t say a lot about ALCAR‘s effectiveness on its own",1642331845,hsw0she,t3_s55k1y,t1_hsvunpg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
