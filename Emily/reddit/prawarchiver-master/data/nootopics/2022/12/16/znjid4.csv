sirsadalot,"TAK is already so strong/ effective that other AMPA PAMs can only reduce its abilities. However that's with two selective PAMs, if one has agonist affinity then it will bind more from TAK. This will impair cognition and cause seizure risk. Since TAK is the cleanest AMPA PAM ever created, then TAK alone is ideal. From there nootropics approaching learning/ memory from different mechanisms serve a greater purpose.",1671221050,j0i0s9r,t3_znjid4,t3_znjid4,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

infrareddit-1,"Thanks. It sounds like youâ€™re saying that PAMs compete with each other, rather than reinforce each other. Is that always the case?",1671221318,j0i1fuv,t3_znjid4,t1_j0i0s9r,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Championxavier12,what about vyvanse? as someone with adhd i want to take both but not sure if they potentiate each other and are dangerous,1671242843,j0jda45,t3_znjid4,t1_j0i0s9r,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"No. TAK, by acting at the allosteric site, will enhance binding of agonists. That's why it can have negative interactions with less selective PAMs.",1671471369,j0v5h76,t3_znjid4,t1_j0sf26w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
