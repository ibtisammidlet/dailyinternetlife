,TUDCA and citicoline help with vision as well. I noticed much clearer vision taking them together.,1671722155,j18wjr3,t3_zsafr0,t3_zsafr0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
RamityCamity,Where do you source your tropisetron? I'm interested in trying because my visual snow has been plaguing me for years lol,1671736520,j19x94t,t3_zsafr0,t3_zsafr0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Komputer_One,"I tried tropisetron for the first time yesterday. I used 5mg. I didn't notice anything within 30 minutes. But after I was playing some videogames I turned my gaze out the window of my apartment and I noticed my vision just feels more ""clear"". I don't really have a word for it. It felt like there was no eye strain at all too. I noticed that my peripheral vision felt better. I don't know why it caused this effect. It could be due to the anti nauseating effects.",1672090915,j1rp4lr,t3_zsafr0,t3_zsafr0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
OnlyOnyc,I have VS and HPPD but I suppose it doesn't really bother me much anymore. I'm still curious what you mean when you say Tropisetron helped it though. Is it an acute affect?,1672463855,j2cfbqm,t3_zsafr0,t3_zsafr0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

BDNFan,"Interesting, nicotine improves my HPPD too but I've attributed it to a7",1671683602,j179we4,t3_zsafr0,t1_j1759sk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,Everychem.com ran by the owner of this subreddit,1671742904,j1ade8l,t3_zsafr0,t1_j19x94t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,It's really interesting right? As I said before I think nAChRs could be involved in VS but no one really knows,1672091020,j1rpcye,t3_zsafr0,t1_j1rp4lr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,It's an acute affect but I haven't taken it long enough in a row to know if it's sustained as well. Tropisetron really just clears up after images and vs from my vision very well,1672464015,j2cflx8,t3_zsafr0,t1_j2cfbqm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ryderlefeg,Nicotine also reduces mine a bit.,1671703714,j181lxt,t3_zsafr0,t1_j179we4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Komputer_One,"I did not mention, the day before yesterday I tried coulracetam. It did not affect my vision as many anecdotes mention but did notice some calming effects. It could be that the coulracetam set up for the visual clarity that tropisetron caused. 

Your info linked is an interesting read and it makes since why you concluded a7 nAChR is involved.",1672102828,j1sewzf,t3_zsafr0,t1_j1rpcye,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Turbulent-Listen8809,Does it last?,1676044498,j7zqrfk,t3_zsafr0,t1_j2cflx8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,It lasts for the duration of the drug and sometimes the day after but as I said I haven't taken it long enough in a row to know if it's cumulative or makes permanent changes,1676048911,j8022h1,t3_zsafr0,t1_j7zqrfk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
