Pure_Nourishment,"I don't mean to hijack this thread, but, I'm just curious if anyone knows why my posts aren't showing up in this community? I also had some questions about tropisetron and, while I can see my posts in my post history, I can't see them anywhere on the main forum.

dhdary,"Ive read a couple studies of Memantine protecting Amphetamine memory deficits and enhancing the effect of stimulants in ADHD Adults, so before telling the doctor Vyvanse wasn't working anymore as I wanted to avoid to increase the dosis, I've started taking memantine and it felt like Vyvanse was working again, now I take it every other day and I am still in the same dosis since 1 year ago.
