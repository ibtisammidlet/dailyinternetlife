spushkin1,"This is copied and pasted from another IDRA-21 post I made but this was my experience: 

“I really enjoyed it!

I found /u/sirsadalot suggested dosage of 2 mg to be too low for me. I tried dosages from 2 to 10 mg, with 6-8 mg being the sweet spot for me. Once this next bottle arrives, I will stay at 6 mg daily. I also found at doses above 8 mg per day, it caused irritability and made me somewhat emotionally numb and socially withdrawn. 

It took 2-3 days to be ""noticeable"", but I particularly liked how vivid my dreams were and how refreshed I felt upon awakening. It created a state of clear-mindedness 45-90 minutes after dosing in the morning. I dosed immediately after waking up. Whatever brain fog I may have been experiencing in the morning, TAK-653 alleviated it. I will say, I noticed the intensity of this effect reduced after day 7.

I found it significantly easier to retain information during lectures, especially in Math. I also added 15 mg of PRL-8-53 after establishing a baseline without it, and they were very synergistic together.

My mood improved a lot after 4 days of consecutive dosing. I found it easier to maintain complex conversations (by complex I mean intellectual, deeper conversations rather than ""small talk"" type conversations). I also found myself more patient, able to wait for my turn to speak more so than before.

I didn't notice any significant effect on motivation, effort perception (someone else also discussed this in another thread),  or focus. Memory improved a lot along with mood.

I stacked it with Bromantane Nasal Spray as well, and I enjoyed the two together.

Overall, I will be purchasing more and plan on running TAK-653 at a minimum until the fall semester is over.”",1669900231,iyhi3ue,t3_z9aofp,t1_iyh0fdn,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

spushkin1,"This was just TAK-653. I only tried IDRA after I ran out of my first bottle. 

I also have really enjoyed IDRA, I think TAK is more sustainable and suitable for everyday use. I will post my experience with IDRA once I have some more experience, I only have run IDRA for a week between shipments for my TAK-653.",1669900732,iyhiztj,t3_z9aofp,t1_iyhit86,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
reddit-dg,"Hi, do you have used IDRA in the meantime? I would be very interested to know how you liked it and at which dosage and which effects and side effects.

Many thanks!",1687351778,joye7xg,t3_z9aofp,t1_iyhiztj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
