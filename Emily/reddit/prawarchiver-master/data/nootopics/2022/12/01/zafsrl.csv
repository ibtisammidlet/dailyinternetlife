antimantium,"BPC and THC, (possibly also bacopa) are probably overpowering everything else including bromantane, I really wouldn't expect to notice it if I was taking either of the two.

Adifferentdose,How much weed are you smoking? Weed is the strongest supplement youâ€™re taking by leaps and bounds. It will interfere with your entire neurochemistry especially if youâ€™re doing it before bed.

Psychological-Egg595,No shit! I have never heard of this but I will say I have used quite a bit of bpc and I don't seem to get the same effects I used to from the exotic pre-work outs I use occasionally and I seem to have an odd caffeine tolerance despite not really using it regularly,1669992411,iymjzy9,t3_zafsrl,t1_iym4kd2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Psychological-Egg595,I ran bpc for probably 8-10 weeks a few times. 300-500 mg a day and sometimes at 1 mg a day. I first used it for some elbow issues from training/ bouncing for decades. Then next time I used it (bc it helped so much with healing and pain relief the first time) after a major pec tear at work (bouncing). The last time I used it was probably a year ago and I was beat to shit. Elbow again and pain in the right shoulder blade/shoulder in the side of the pec tear.  It helped every time. However I had less success with it the last run. TBH I was also the biggest I have ever been 6'2 250 and  around 10-12% bodyfat. So I was training hard and not giving my body enough of a break. I ran tb-500 alongside it most times as well... And some gh when I could ðŸ˜Š,1672842977,j2wtvv9,t3_zafsrl,t1_iyol1wi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Probably better to make a shitty half assed spray at home vs sublingual ROA? Or actually no for some reason?",1669988710,iymcabf,t3_zafsrl,t1_iym2bc1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Dbdbmama,"fookin nasal spray bottles LOL  
Looks like ill be using this oil/bromantane mixture via my mouth.  
Dont attempt to do the mix w/o heat.   


Its not that I didnt believe you blankXu, its I already mixed it up after trying to find conclusive noted on mixing it. You are correct tho, 100%. Mixing w/o heat is garbage lol but I have a heat plate in the mail and will attempt to add heat and get it dissolved. Might as well at this point.  


The crystals dont break down enough to be ejected from the tip without heating.",1669996383,iymtixo,t3_zafsrl,t1_iymcabf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
