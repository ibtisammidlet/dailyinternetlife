I’ve been taking 2-3 sprays daily with 500mg agmatine for around 3 weeks now with some good results initially, but can’t help feeling like I’ve built some sort of tolerance to it now. Is there anything I can do to bring the “magic” back?

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to  work for me. I'm afraid I'm a non-responder, but I'm making this post in  hopes of finding the culprit if I am not a non-responder after all.

I've  been taking it for 2 weeks sublingual (about 15 minutes) and have tried  various doses (15mg - 50mg, 150mg once) and 2 sources, but I either  feel nothing or just a burst of energy that goes away almost  immediately. I take it on an empty stomach and tried both mixing and not  mixing it with fat (extra virgin olive oil).

Is  there anything else that could prevent me from experiencing the  effects? I eat properly, usually fast, exercise, sleep somewhat well.  Can it be another substance from my stack which consists of the below?

\- Alpha GPC 300mg

\- L-Tyrosine 1000mg

\- Monolaurin 500mg

\- Oregano Oil 150mg

\- B-12 2000mcg

\- Choline & Inositol 500mg

\- Selenium 200mcg

\- Zinc 50mg

\- L-Lysine 2000mg

\- Vitamin D 10k iu

\- Bacoma Monnieri 500mg

\- NL-BPC-157 200mcg

\- Creatine 3000mg

\- HMB 3000mg

\- THC in the evening

I am back with yet another IDRA-21 related question lol.

I was wondering if dosing TAK-653 with IDRA-21 still active would be problematic and/or counterproductive. 

My last IDRA-21 dose was \~30 hours ago, so I most certainly still have IDRA-21 active.
