Fayiss_123,"I limit it to one or two sprays depending on how much energy I have when I wake up and take 2 days off a week. Of course euphoria is going to boost the “magic” effect, but your baseline motivation and productivity should be enhanced over the long-term anyway. 

I don’t know if we should be chasing euphoria for that matter, but tolerance to acute effects develop either way, and if you find those acute effects useful, then only use it as needed, not religiously, to capitalise on them.",1670057438,iyqa5o2,t3_zau6m8,t3_zau6m8,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

FATTERFISH2FILLET,"I can’t manage to get good sprays out of this compound, the applicator is always clogged and I’ve tried other spray bottles and cleaned out nozzle etc etc…is there something wrong with my liquid, or any other tips? At best, I will get a narrow stream or a failed spray (drip down), and I end up wasting quite a bit just trying to get a decent wide spray….",1670267139,iz1auka,t3_zau6m8,t3_zau6m8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
LieWorldly4492,"I've read a lot of reports where memantine helped with this, but it will make you feel very off for about 2 weeks and is not at all pleasant to take.

jeej_min,That’s weird cos agmatine completely lowered my caffeine tolerance! Not saying it applies to bromantane but still something to think about,1670068879,iyqn4rw,t3_zau6m8,t1_iyq5ja4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

jeej_min,"That is a massive dose imo, if I take any more than 4 I just feel like shit/depressed. What effects do you notice with that much bromantane?",1670317559,iz43a60,t3_zau6m8,t1_iz38cig,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
jeej_min,"Yeah it definitely didn’t smell like I expected but I can’t say mine gave me a sinus infection, only the a headache but I think that’s because I’m using too much. The effects are definitely there but it’s subtle - not a kick like you get from traditional stimulants. I’m 99% certain I’m undiagnosed ADHD that’s why I found it so prominent to begin with.

As for getting your order from everychem, when did you get that? I made an order 2 weeks ago but still no update regarding shipping or order confirmation. I’ve messaged u/sirsadalot on here and emailed the site but still no response.",1670079289,iyr4n52,t3_zau6m8,t1_iyr2027,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Caprylic acid is antibiotic so it's extremely unlikely if not impossible your sinus infection was from my product, especially since I take more than adequate procedures to reduce environmental contact.

spushkin1,"Even with the spray, I notice effects diminishing within 6-7 hours. With that dose, I get the effects everyone claims and advertised. I never responded to 1 spray, and 2 sprays works occasionally.

,The difference is that with a new baseline rather than tolerance you still retain any kind of measurable benefits from the compounds whereas with tolerance you are just back to square 1.,1670090330,iyrv05p,t3_zau6m8,t1_iyquqjf,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

jeej_min,"It has raised my baseline motivation/drive levels to the point where I’m not having to physically drag and force myself to do things. I used to be so unbelievably irritable all the time too and while it hasn’t completely cured it it has made it so much more manageable. It’s not a magic cure all but it’s made my life a hell of a lot easier. 

Only other stim I’ve tried is modafinil and they’re nothing alike, mods feel quite dirty to me I don’t like the feeling I get from being on them it just feels like forced wakefulness, bromantane feels much more natural.

And dosage wise I use 2/3 all at once with my morning coffee.",1670280875,iz29kur,t3_zau6m8,t1_iz232jn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
