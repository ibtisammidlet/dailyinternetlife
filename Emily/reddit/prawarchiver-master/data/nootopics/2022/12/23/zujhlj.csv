Dbdbmama,it crystallizes if too cold. Can be reheated to re-mix. Hopefully you will get a better answer on how to re-heat as i have no idea. Potency shouldn't change tho.,1671919364,j1jmwyv,t3_zujhlj,t3_zujhlj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Reheating it in a water bath or double boiler should melt it back down no worries, just take the plastic sprayer top and cap off first.",1671929820,j1k84nk,t3_zujhlj,t3_zujhlj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
