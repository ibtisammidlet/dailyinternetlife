,"Anything that acts as an MAOI inhibitor would have MAOI inhibitor side effects.

The new vignatex from ND at 2 capsules is equivalent to a starting dose of selegeline (1.25mg I think?) , 2 capsules being 50mg of isovetixin and isovetixin having that property in test tube assays. Couldnt comment on how the pharmacokinetics would shake out (to actually allow that 50mg isovrtixin to be bio available)

But again , if its inhibits monoamine oxidase then it will have the classic side effect profile of that class , by definition.",1672080249,j1r1cb4,t3_zvmidw,t3_zvmidw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
