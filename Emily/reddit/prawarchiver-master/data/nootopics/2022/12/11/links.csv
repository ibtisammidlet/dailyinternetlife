I checked this with the mods before posting – hope you all don’t mind!

The Centre for Affective Disorders at King’s College London is currently researching the use of lithium supplements purchased over the counter as a health supplement. If you have tried this, please consider taking our questionnaire (link below) and telling us about it (you can choose to enter a prize draw for a £10/$10 equivalent shopping voucher). It takes about 10 minutes.

This survey aims to find out more about people’s experience of taking lithium supplements, e.g., how much they took, how long for, did it help? etc… The survey is anonymous, albeit you would have to leave an email to be entered into a prize draw.

This project is being completed without funding by academic staff at the university rather than by any pharmaceutical company or individual with financial motivations.

Kind regards,

I have used Bromantane for two weeks before sublingually with no noticeable effects.  I ended up titrating up to doses as high as 650 mg.  Still nothing.  I ordered the nasal spray to try, is there any hopes that I will receive an effect from nasal administration?

Also, I saw ONE comment on reddit that due to Bromantane’s anti-fibrotic effects, it MAY inhibit muscle protein synthesis, but I could not find any more information.  Is this a legitimate concern for using Bromantane alongside bodybuilding?
