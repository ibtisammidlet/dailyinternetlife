Designer_Custard9008,Survey isn't working. My wife and I are on 10 mg daily for years. Cuts depression and overwhelmed feelings quite well. 15 mg after a short while made me feel flat so 10 is best for me. We haven't noticed any other sides.,1679267045,jcvsapz,t3_zlrc4h,t3_zlrc4h,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

You can find loads of suppliers or providers for lithium ororate (not to be confused with lithium aspartate which didn't work for me and many others)

I would recommend starting with 1 mg 
Instead of the typical 5 mg
As much sugarcoating as you wanna give lithium ororate for being low dose and harmless

The mineral was so good and efficient
They turned it into a drug and started prescribing it(not the ororate one)

So that being said 3 thing stop keep watch for while using it

1: your thyroid, lithium is famous for autoimmune thyroid issues, so if you get any pain or discomfort around your neck STOP

2: your mood, lithium is a strong serotonergic substance.
It blocks and almost inhibits a anything related to dopamine.
Hence why it's so good for bipolarity, cause it cuts down on hypomania

3:your kidneys and your hormones
At a high enough dosage lithium is detrimental to your kidney
So it's always good to keep an eye on those
And as for the hormones
Lithium is very estrogenic and in fact promotes the same proteins and enzymes as estrogen like
The Sirt 1 Enzymes
So get your hormones tested and checked before jumping knees deep

Good luck!",1671655350,j15jdu5,t3_zlrc4h,t1_j14ktzw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Designer_Custard9008,Usually 1 mg costs more than 5 mg but the smaller dosage would correspond with my understanding of a reasonable recommended daily nutritional intake for the general population.,1679267200,jcvsmvh,t3_zlrc4h,t1_j15jdu5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
