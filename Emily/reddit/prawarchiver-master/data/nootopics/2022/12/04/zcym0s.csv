ChrisHarles,"My personal theory is that ego is something that can be cultivated the same way ""ego death"" can be via meditation. Things like affirmations and mental exercises that do the opposite of meditation should inflate/reinforce your ego and lower doses of psychedelics could actually aid that process.

The ego and confidence is based on a bunch of facts anyway (some more ""hardwired"" than others) and to randomly get ego from a nootropic means you just become more biased to the facts that inflate your ego, which imo could become a bad thing left unchecked.

I know this isn't what you asked for lol but yeah the things the other commenters said like testosterone and dopaminergics should definitely work. I'd probably add anxiolytics and other things that reduce neuroticism as well.",1670297250,iz39kwp,t3_zcym0s,t3_zcym0s,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"I’ve also asked this many times and everyone says something different. I have never got a clear answer either but the general answers include a combination of dopaminergics and test boosters such as maca, bromantane, tongkat ali, shilajit, phenylpiracetam, etc.

Out of the things I’ve listed. Phenylpiracetam works in boosting the ego the most for me. I think it depends on the personality you have too.",1670227508,iyzah4z,t3_zcym0s,t3_zcym0s,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

KonstantinExtreme,"Not a nootropic but amphetamines or stims in general will definetely inflate your ego. In fact it is one of the side effects that I hate about the most of Vyvanse because sometimes It makes me an asshole and I'm not like that when sober, but ego inflation is a love and hate relationship because sometimes it feels very nice to have your ego inflated like when you are in the gym but most of the time ego inflation it's not something that I'm looking for at all",1670314130,iz3zjc3,t3_zcym0s,t3_zcym0s,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Testosterone and Primobolan would be excellent for mental clarity.

Masteron too much CNS stress. I have no experience with Proviron but I’ve heard good things and bad things. Any other suggestions? I don’t believe DHB is very popular and I’ve heard PIP is awful.",1670296361,iz37rk6,t3_zcym0s,t1_iz09u1j,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
