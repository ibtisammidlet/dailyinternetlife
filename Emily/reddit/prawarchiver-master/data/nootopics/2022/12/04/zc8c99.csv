Defiant_Proposal_105,"The binding affinities of it are 4,21 µg at 5-HT2A and 0,45 µg at M1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor). So it's way more active at M1 and a very weak positive allosteric modulator at 5-HT2A.

For comparison: Psilocin is a partial agonist with an affinity of 0,1 µg at 5-HT2A.

My personal opinion: If you want the effects of microdosing then you have to microdose some real psychedelics. ND did some good job around the marketing of their new product, it's pretty hyped, but from reading the first reviews my impression of it gets only stronger that it's nothing special.

Don't know about the M1 effects and if it's different/better than other cholinergics. (Cholinergics make me depressed/unmotivated so I'm also not very interested in this.)",1670176554,iywayua,t3_zc8c99,t3_zc8c99,16,False,t5_4aoxhu

5-ht2a PAMs definitely have a dopaminergic effect. What I liked about Cognance vs acid or shrooms was that it didn’t feel inebriating/intoxicating but 100% mind altering in a good way that I’m not sure is possible other than through the 5-ht2a mechanism",1670166754,iyvnuhg,t3_zc8c99,t3_zc8c99,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
Pure_Nourishment,"I haven't tried it, but I'm definitely interested in doing so eventually. It seems like some people feel like there are microdose feelings while others say it just feels like bacopa. I'm not a science wizard or anything, but I'm pretty sure ""tickling"" the same serotonin receptor that psilocybin does is not going to properly mimic the effects. If it is beneficial in some way, then that's great...but it does seem like a marketing ploy to some degree.",1670161569,iyvdzet,t3_zc8c99,t3_zc8c99,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Prime example of how placebo driven anecdotes and half-baked ideas around popular topics is all it takes to run a supplement company.

One of their most upvoted posts is how Cognance doesn't work at all.

There's plenty of great herbals out there, but ND is not releasing them. Instead you get Bacopa for the 15th time, when it could be things such as Carnosic acid, White Willow Bark, Clausenamide and more - things that I've been talking about for over a year.

They are asleep at the wheel. But as long as they're getting paid, why should they care? They only talk about purity, acting like they're the only people who have real products, because it doesn't matter if they're selling grass extracts, because it's *tested by ND!* What an amazing marketing strategy, become the god of what's real or fake. Totally not biased.

Given half their catalog is just GABAergics, it should be fairly obvious by now that cognition enhancement is not on the to-do list. For crying out loud they released pyroglutamic acid as a replacement for Piracetam. All of the studies on that shit just talk about how toxic it is to have high amounts. Or their favorite fallback, Cordyceps, which is an adenosine agonist, not even remotely similar pharmacologically. Nor can it do the same things.

With half of their team being on opioids like kratom, methadone and others it's no wonder they nod off whenever some actual investigative research is required. After Sabroxy failed I lost faith in ND. Saw things for how they really were. It's a money making machine, plain and simple.

Jazzlike_Fan232,"Very helpful and informative answer. Just an un-biased personal opinion. If It didn’t live up to the hype so be it. Marketing played a major role sure. Got everyone hopes up not cool. But it allows people to reach informative decisions of what works and doesn’t based on experience not hype as it will die down. The noise is only temporary. Becomes more silent. Everything seems less vague. More understanding of what it is and isn’t. 

Frankly u/sirsadalot just try it give yourself a placebo protocol. For testing “unsure” product expectations. See what comes up if anything. 

I say it for how it is. anamalous to subject my self as fast responding for substances. I noticeably will be detaching points of understanding what goes on in my life “self awareness”. I can see if certain instances or situations come forward more abruptly or subtly. Having the traces back of childhood behavior or different situational behavior of tasks or emotions. 

Noticing how has my own personal life as changed and shifted. Learning wisdom and knowledge. Always been very abruptly infiltrated. Other circumstances or situations made it so difficult to gather and cultivate ideas subtly. Now Cognance the talk of the show . Has made this transition into consciousness subtle to get my self and my awareness in place for more tranquil and processing of emotions a subtle experience. Proves some utility for me anyway. I even said to myself “how can this be like microdosing!”. I had the lowest expectations then anything on ND had purchased in the past from them. Why because of the damn HYPE! I hate it as much as sirsadalot. Trust me if works it works. It doesn’t it doesn’t. I’m worried about me and myself. Not because the GOD OF ND said it’s the most innovative and diverse nootropics yet. Give me a break! Hell no never!

zidatris,"So, anecdotes are placebo ridden when people say it works, but not when people say it doesn’t work? I’m not knocking it. Definitely possible, but you seem like the other extreme, rather than the modest middle somewhere in between. I’ve tried Cognance, and so far it’s different than standard bacopa, but nothing too special. This post was specifically about “objective assessments of Cognance”, which, frankly, do not exist yet. It’s all in the air. Not about ND. Not about why you think they do not release other products you consider superior.

To sum it up, the placebo ridden apes on the ND are one extreme, but this answer, bashing “the 15th bacopa” with no plausible explanation, is nowhere far from the other extreme.",1670184652,iyww6ln,t3_zc8c99,t1_iyvad0a,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
