So.

It appears I may have a genetic pre-disposition to issues with certain types of memory. My brother & mother both complain of memory issues, although my diet & lifestyle is far more well-tuned.

For me it's working memory, word recall & verbal memory. I have issues remembering names & even people I've spoken to completely.

Now this could be down to poor breathing after abdominal surgery a few years back, but there's only so much I can do.

With that taken into consideration, my question is:

Are there any nootropics that can have a permanent effect on word recall and/or working memory?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Permanent memory enhancers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/zgino6/permanent_memory_enhancers/

More surprisingly, Iboaine supersedes most all well-known post-detoxification modalities, comprising the lowest rate of relapse in prolonged abstinence, even in users with protracted poly-drug use sequela.

Following naturally as a perfect analog of Ibogane without the cardiological comorbidities, why then are there so few (anecdotal) accounts of TBG?

More anecdotal experiences would be encouraging, albeit lacking (which is concerning). Although anecdotal accounts are the bottom of the barrel in terms of clinical data quality standards, some data is better than none.

As a clinical statistician (and Kratom user myself for pain management in lieu of painkillers after my accident), I'm in the same boat facing the prospect of a lenghty W/D.

I'm tempted to design an observational (survey/questionnaire) or experimental (informal Reddit unsupervised trial) of TBG with the objective of at least assimilating some borderline-acceptable poorman's clinical data as a cursory measure of it efficacy in resolving OPD mediated disturbances.

If you have used TBG to the same effect as Ibogaine (or both), for acute W/D management or as an adjunct for PAWS or for the objective of craving-inhibition/abstinence  - may you describe your OPD use history in brief, TBG (or/versus Ibogaine) response, dosage/frequency and outcome?

It'd be extremely valuable to know what the user base/response ""temperature-take"" is on this promising compound, considering this analog has proven to be effective in rodent studies.

Also, would any current OPD/Kratom users be willing to undertake this collectively under a unified/standardized regimen as a mini virtual clinical trial to obtain experimental data (would involve anonymous clinical history questionnaire, a standardized dosing regimen, a daily reporting questionnaire of symptom improvement, benchmark testing, etc...)?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Verdict or Experiences on TBG in favor of Ibogaine on OPD WD Extinction?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/zeuccs/verdict_or_experiences_on_tbg_in_favor_of/
