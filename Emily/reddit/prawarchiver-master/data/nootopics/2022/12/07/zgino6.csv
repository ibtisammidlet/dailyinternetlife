BDNFan,First line should be cholinergics but also look into cycling NSI-189 for hippocampal neurogenesis. Cerebrolysin [ameliorates age related memory loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27164468/),1670554039,izhcgpa,t3_zgino6,t3_zgino6,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

verysatisfiedredditr,"Huperzine A and Alpha GPC help me, but not taken at the same time as high choline isnt good either.  Not a huge boost or permanent but I'm doing alot wrong.",1670607213,izjxmuz,t3_zgino6,t3_zgino6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sospian,"One thing that put me off NSI is its mixed reviews & negative experiences. As someone who has used a lot of psychedelics in the past as well as meditation, I assumed no issues with the hippocampus.

With that in mind, mushrooms have this ability to do what I can only describe as “unblocking a pipe” that allows me to function cognitively better. 

Perhaps I’m mistaken and that this has nothing to do with the hippocampus, but one thing I’d like to be able to do is maintain a higher awareness.

As for cerebrolysin, definitely something I’ve considered for the future, but I wouldn’t trust myself to take anything intravenously",1670624492,izl5zsg,t3_zgino6,t1_izhcgpa,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DidNotVote2020,"This is not appropriate unless someone has good reason to suspect that they have pathological integrated stress response signaling, such as from a head injury or stroke. Even then, you can't self diagnose this. Isrib just ""reboots"" that signaling to hopefully return back to normal. Integrated stress response is an important cytoprotective process. There is no evidence that isrib is appropriate as a nootropic unless you have this specific class of pathologies, and that's assuming it even works in humans. The basic idea is to only use it for a few days.

There may be potential for anti aging as ISR signaling activity increases in age and may be pathological, but there is no protocol for this currently and chronically inhibiting ISR is not good as it is an important protective mechanism. We don't know if that signaling is increasing with age due to an appropriate response to an acute or chronic stressor with cytotoxic implications.",1670600350,izjfyqy,t3_zgino6,t1_iziknk9,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

BDNFan,"Anecdotally, I have noticed improvement in visual memory after taking NSI. The side affects were only annoying when I took it during the day so I switched to night and it really improved my sleep

For cerebrolysin you can put it into a nasal spray so you don't have to take it IV",1670624633,izl6cey,t3_zgino6,t1_izl5zsg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
verysatisfiedredditr,"I pretty much stuck to whatever was on the Nootropics Depot label, the recommended serving size.  Never really went over 250mg with the AGPC for example.

BDNFan,Tiredness / mild headache. iirc it acts on glucocorticoid receptors and reduces cortisol which is also the wakefulness hormone. That's probably why I get side affects when taking it during the day. ~5:00 is a good time to take it to wind down,1670629968,izlimcq,t3_zgino6,t1_izlid80,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
