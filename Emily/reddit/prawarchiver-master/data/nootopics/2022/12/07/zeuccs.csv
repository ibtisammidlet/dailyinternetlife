Having taken both, the ibogaine is hands-down effective at what it aims to do, though can be hit and miss. The TBG gave me weird brain-fog and disassociation without any of the benefits of the introspection and 'centering' that ibogaine does .",1670494429,izdpn3h,t3_zeuccs,t3_zeuccs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Janime1983,"I have at least 8g of sacramental iboga bark I bought from the Netherlands years ago, but can’t take it bc I am on Suboxone. Burning a hole in my drawer and expensive too. Eventually will try it when I go back to using only Kratom bc I’ve stocked up on that for the future",1670815820,izvgp2m,t3_zeuccs,t3_zeuccs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MadScientistRat,"Thank you for the information. Did you notice any benefits with TBG in terms of physical withdrawal abatement?

How effective would you say Iboga was in terms of extinguishing residual Kratom/OPD mediated withdrawal disturbances?

Any notes on dosing and frequency? Or other notable remarks?

Do you recommend abstaining from or tapering down Kratom before Iboga/TBG ? Were the diminished withdrawal effects immediately extinguished/apparent?

Thank you.",1670827080,izw03u2,t3_zeuccs,t1_izdpn3h,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MadScientistRat,"Thank you for the information. Do you have any previous experiences whether successful or not using Iboga for withdrawal abatement?

When do you plan on using iboga/TBG/Analogs for jumping off the Kratom?

Have you heard of any other user accounts using Iboga/TBG/Analogs for extinguishing opioid withdrawal / abatement?

Any measure of the effect size or efficacy in terms of extinguishing withdrawal symptoms? Physical/psychological, or both?

Thank you very much.",1670827432,izw0laq,t3_zeuccs,t1_izvgp2m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Janime1983,"I bought the Iboga around 2010 or 2011 around the time I was winding down taking Suboxone. I can’t remember how much it cost, but it was pretty expensive for 8g. I did a lot of research but have forgotten most of it now. I wanted to go to Mexico but it never worked out bc of travel & having to be off Sub for at least 2 weeks or whatever to take the Ibo, so I bought the bark but never ended up using it either. Eventually went to a methadone clinic for years & then switched to Kratom for a couple months & felt awesome but then switched back to Subs, then back to Mdone for a year then now back to subs again. Feel like shit everyday bc of subs mess hormones up so bad. I’ve bought so much Kratom over the past 1.5 years for when I switch back. I’ll probably try the bark then, but I don’t really know 8 grams will really do anything",1670908213,j00lciu,t3_zeuccs,t1_izw0laq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
