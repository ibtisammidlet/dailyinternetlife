,It's likely not solely due to AMPA PAM effects. The potentiation of acetylcholine's effects would also cause downstream increases of monoamines and other neurotransmitters. Racetam pharmacology is very poorly understood at the moment so you probably won't know definitively how exactly Piracetam produces it's effects. And because the effects are likely produced by multiple mechanisms it'd probably be difficult to replicate the effects using different substances.,1670640226,izm3vnb,t3_zgqdss,t3_zgqdss,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

FrigoCoder,"> Would potent antioxidants prevent the ROS crash ?

I just researched this yesterday, autism, CFS, and insulin resistance all involve impaired antioxidant defenses. I do not know the underlying root cause, but things could help that increase Nrf2, GCLC, GCLM, Glutathione, and other enzymes.

> So you are saying that my membrane fluidity is impaired ?

Yes, cells pad their membranes with cholesterol if they sense danger. This helps protect against threats like oxidative stress, but stops glucose uptake and mitochondrial function.

> If this is the case is there a way to fix it?

Nutrients like EPA and lutein can stabilize membranes, but I have not found medications that do the same. I am still searching for a solution, but we have a very complicated problem at our hand.

> If I fix it would I always be in a piracetam kind of state?

Yeah basically, healthy people do not experience any improvement from piracetam.

> Are there any other chems that do this?

Vitamin B1 increases ATP production by boosting a mitochondrial enzyme. Unfortunately it also overproduces ROS, so you are also prone to crash on it. Carnitine, lipoic acid, and uridine can also provide similar effects.",1670581332,izihpl2,t3_zgqdss,t1_izigzx0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
