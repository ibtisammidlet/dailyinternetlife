neuro__atypical,"It's not something you necessarily feel, although some do. You need to do actual cognitive testing.",1672101739,j1sclre,t3_zw0j9w,t3_zw0j9w,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"I’ve been taking 2 mg daily for six weeks. I have noticed a calm, creative focus that lasts for three-to-four hours. Have not taken any benchmark tests. About five hours later, I notice a reliable, thirty-minute dizziness period. I’m going to take a break at the eight-week point to see what cessation is like.",1672178462,j1wcnls,t3_zw0j9w,t3_zw0j9w,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
BDNFan,"It feels very nootropic to me. Helps me learn wrestling moves and it's amazing for complex or introspective thoughts.

You may just be tolerant to AMPA PAMs so adding another noot that prolonges AMPA currents (like idebenone) would probably help you",1672118036,j1t82km,t3_zw0j9w,t3_zw0j9w,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

royboi14,You should do some iq and human benchmark tests to really see the difference. You won't feel it like a stimulant or something.,1672111696,j1sx385,t3_zw0j9w,t3_zw0j9w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
69harambe69,I took it at evening one time and it definitely kept me up and made me research some stuff. Interesting nootropic,1672162585,j1v8t09,t3_zw0j9w,t3_zw0j9w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

infrareddit-1,"I think it’s improved creativity for me, both divergent and convergent. It’s subtle, but definite. Piracetam is not subtle for me. There’s a sort of “push” to piracetam that helps cognition, but makes me impatient and irritable when others are not perceived to be moving as fast. Does that make sense?",1672767579,j2sjyfc,t3_zw0j9w,t1_j2lya7p,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"Thanks for checking in. I was on for eight weeks. I have been off for 10 days. I did not notice any withdrawal-like symptoms. Just an absence of effect. I had been getting a nice, calm creative boost for several hours with a smooth ramp up and ramp down. Upon cessation, I noticed no boost.",1674677734,j5v808p,t3_zw0j9w,t1_j5uyro0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
