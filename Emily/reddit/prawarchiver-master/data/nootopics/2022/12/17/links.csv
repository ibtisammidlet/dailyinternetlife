I already ordered *TAK-653* and *Tropisetron*, but since *Naboglamine* isn't yet available, I'm thinking about these alternative stacks:

\- *TAK-653* \+ *Tropisetron* \+ *D-Serine* \+ *Magtein*

\- *TAK-653* \+ *Tropisetron* \+ *PRL-8-53*

\- Just stick with *TAK-653* \+ *Tropisetron*

My goal is a short-term memory and IQ boost (for a period of \~1-2 months) - I have several IT certification exams on my list, and I want to absorb as much info as possible, while still being able to retain this information long-term, since it'll be needed for my job later that year. So it doesn't become ""What did I learn 2 weeks ago? I don't remember anything"".

Anyone tried any of these combos? Or has other ideas?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Best addition to TAK-653 and Tropisetron,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/zocavd/best_addition_to_tak653_and_tropisetron/
