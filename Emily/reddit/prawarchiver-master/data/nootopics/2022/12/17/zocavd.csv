ozonep2,"Interesting! How long have you been using this stack? Did you experince any major side effects? Also, do you take PRL-8-53 every day? I see some users mention tolerance build-up after daily use.

PRL-8-53 looks like a ***VERY*** interesting nootropic on paper, but that's what bothers me. If it's so powerful (increases memory by > 30% even in healthy people) - why pharma companies aren't interested? No further trials etc.... Why it's almost forgotten now even in RC community? Even u/sirsadalot never mentions it as a promising or recommended nootropic.",1671352846,j0owiuj,t3_zocavd,t1_j0mzbi1,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

Careful-Cobbler-8359,"Works pretty well sublingually for me for cognitive effects, although 1 gram is a lot to keep under your toungue for 15-20min.

ozonep2,"Hmm, interesting! The first time I hear about this side effect. Do you have any links? Still not sure about PRL use. 

Do you mean it's like social avoidance on amphetamines? Where you become robotic for a few hours while drug is in the body? Or you mean some permanent damage that can't be reversed?",1671960379,j1lg55i,t3_zocavd,t1_j1k9ox2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ozonep2,"I think you're overestimating the power of caffeine :-p

TAK and trop don't synergise with caffeine (based on my experience). You just get their benefits + energy from caffeine. That's all.

Careful-Cobbler-8359,"Cheapest is ND, there's also MegaResveratrol which was my go-to for the longest time, finally Thorne has it in some combination formulas. Since I take it in powder at 1-2g daily, ND and Megaresv are the best options. 

Also although there's a huge fad around NMN/NR and Nad boosters, it really amplifies the effects of everything for me, an alternative is just waiting 1-2 days between resveratrol doses. 

My favorite stack is NMN/NR+ Resveratrol and TAK.
