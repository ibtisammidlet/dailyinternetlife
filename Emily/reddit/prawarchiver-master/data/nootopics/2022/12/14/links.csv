Which nootropics/supplements/drugs do you think has the strongest effect? 
I havent noticed much relief especially for anhedonia or fatigue with most nootropics unfortunately.

Also is peptides the way to go? Or pherines? Racetams? 
I feel clueless as Theres so much that has affinity that seems promising bit in reality not much effect..

In My experience:
1. Vyvanse, My adhd med. Only thing that removes My anhedonia completely, but its only for 4 hours so looking to replace it somehow hence this post.

2. Phenibut, but not that sustainable, and does nothing for My anhedonia.

3. N acetyl semax amidate(helped quite a bit, with everything i mentioned above) like 20-30% i think.
