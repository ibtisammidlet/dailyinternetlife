dragonology,Trying to forget or avoid traumatic memories is actually a symptom of PTSD. Avoidance worsens symptoms by strengthening your fear of the memories and the belief that they are overwhelming. Trauma is healed by safely approaching memories in therapy or with psychedelic medicine. You cannot heal trauma with drugs.

EchoingSimplicity,"Honestly, MDMA therapy in order to reprocess your trauma in a positive light would be much more effect. If you have PTSD, I can't recommend doing this on your own and without professional help.",1646602997,hzmjjua,t3_t7fo46,t3_t7fo46,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
MF3DOOM,"You cannot delete previous memories as that would be described as a cognitive deficit but rather reflect on them. Putting politics aside, Dr. Jordan Peterson makes a really good point on emotions associated with a memory, he said something like “A negative emotion associated with a memory for more than 6 months strives for mastery”. I’ll try to find the video, SSRIs can definitely help too by numbing the fear/fight or flight response.",1646514072,hzhux15,t3_t7fo46,t3_t7fo46,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Undocommand,"I’ve developed a habit of monologging, making verbal diarrhoea, and speaking to people as if they were there to address any form of latent resentment, frustrations, and things I failed to act on in the moment. 

The things I end up saying gives me insight to what I unconsciously feel/think, or conscious enough but find difficult to fully understand. 

The process of fishing out whats in my unconscious/subconscious grants me the opportunity to *do something about it*. Sometimes it gives closure. 
And like you said, it has to do with ‘mastery’. I’ve gained, I’ve lost, and now I’ve moved on.",1646634901,hzobfot,t3_t7fo46,t1_hzhux15,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I'll try again though, are you supposed to take it and examine your past memories? Maybe in conjunction with psylocibin, weed or these type of drugs should work but taking it alone I dont know",1646579060,hzkyhq2,t3_t7fo46,t1_hzkd6ky,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Narwaaaahl,"Yeah i think that's the idea, reexamining those memories while under the influence of Propranolol is supposed to alter the emotional part of those memories

Edit: I think it would be best to not take any additional psychotropic substances in the beginning, in particular taking psilocybin without proper guidance could lead adverse effects. Maybe after the emotional aspect of the memory is substantially reduced you could try using psilocybin, but it's not free of risk.",1646588475,hzlks4y,t3_t7fo46,t1_hzkyhq2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
