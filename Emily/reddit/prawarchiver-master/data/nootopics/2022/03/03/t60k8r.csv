literalbrainlet,"I went through 5-10 grams of this stuff in a year and noticed aftereffects on motor coordination and verbal acuity that exceeded that of either benzos or regular phenibut. F-phenibut had actually felt fairly kind to me mentally (I experienced no addiction or perceptibly lasting aftereffects), but this post is really worrying me. So to clarify, it should be neurotoxic because it destroys GABA-B receptor sites? If so, should an f-phenibut user be more concerned about the destruction of GABA-B sites or the potentially resulting excitotoxicity? Finally, in what ways (if any) could this GABA-B mediated neurotoxicity be ameliorated?

EDIT: Just noticed OP only linked one study, and that study was linked twice but from different publications. The first three links are all based on a single *in vitro* study; the last link is entirely anecdotal and doesn't even support your point (the OP came back and posted that his symptoms were most likely due to withdrawal). I'm not saying this post is wrong, but there doesn't seem like there's enough evidence to draw such drastic conclusions. Is there any more proof backing this hypothesis?",1646413086,hzc4od7,t3_t60k8r,t3_t60k8r,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

feltemomightdelete,"i have been experimenting with f-but/baflofen for nearly 3 years now for quite a couple months of which i have abused it on a regular basis, mixing it with all kinds of other drugs, a lot of which have mediated their effects through similar mechanisms of action as well etc.

even though my dosing didn’t escalate and never exceeded 600mg per dose, i have dosed high multiple times a day daily for over 2 months straight just to gauge the habituation/weaning timeline, tolly buildup and compare to other substances/just to see if what ppl were saying held true. (one of my buddies warned me to be extremely cautious since dude he knew got seizures after using f-but at moderate doses for hardly even 2 weeks)

tolerance buildup was very slow at first compared to other gabapentinoids, and high doses felt much more enjoyable/less negative side fx. (i haven’t used in 300-400mg+ doses in ages though)

i haven’t noticed any mental decline, and had a complete physical checkup a cpl months ago including long term ecg, sall good.

a bunch of times when mixing with fluorobut i couldn’t enjoy the nod at all (besides the notorious gabaB OD twitches) cos i was genuinely scared my hearts gonna jump out of my chest. kratom and zolpidem in particular come to mind, think it’s due to qt interval prolongation or whatever the fuck.

purely from experience i doubt it’s directly cardiotoxic or neurotoxic, at least not particularly much more so than a lot of other drugs, the prospect of insane receptor downregulation/straight up destruction of receptor sites on the other hand is p scary..",1683625397,jjg7glh,t3_t60k8r,t3_t60k8r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

labratdream,"It is unlikely but happens sometimes. 

"" The mechanism of fluorine  
participation in their different undesirable effects has  
not been fully explained. Defluorination of  
fluorinated drugs can readily occur during  
biotransformation, or may also occur spontaneously,  
if a molecule is sufficiently electrophilic to undergo  
direct reaction with a nucleophilic group present in  
proteins and amino acids, such as the amino group  
in lysine, the sulphydryl group in cysteine or the  
hydroxyl group in serine (Park et al. 2001). Such  
defluorination was observed for example in the case  
of an antimalarial drug 5-fluoro-amodiaquine  
(Harrison et al. 1992) or hormone  
2-fluoroethynilestradiol (Morgan et al. 1992). In rare  
instances, even the trifluoromethyl group may  
undergo defluorination (Thompson et al. 2000)""

""Formation of nephrotoxic halogenated alkenes  
during alkaline degradation in carbon dioxide  
absorbers, such as 1-chloro-1,2-difluorovinyl  
difluoromethyl ether or fluoromethyl-2,2-difluoro-1-  
(trifluoromethyl)vinyl ether (compound A) were  
suggested as an alternative mechanism for renal  
toxicity (Orhan et al. 2001). The mechanism of  
compound A renal toxicity is controversial, with the  
debate focused on the role of the renal cysteine  
conjugate β-lyase pathway in the biotransformation  
of compound A. ""
