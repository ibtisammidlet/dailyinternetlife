Whats your stack/nootropics that ACTUALLY work?

I know its related to HDAC but didn't find much on it. I saw nigella sative was a HDAC inhibitor but its probably very weak.

One thing that worked for me though is Baclofen, relaxes me a lot and inhibits fear/hesitation a little, but I'm looking for something different.

Obviosly tried phenibut and while its good, you can use it only one every 2 weeks to have a good effect and even then sometimes doesnt work that well.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Best stack for getting outside of your comfort zone,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t7fmk6/best_stack_for_getting_outside_of_your_comfort/

* tongkat ali (I tried and worked really well)
* shilajit (didnt feel any sinergy)
* cistanche (actually gave me headache for 1/2 hrs, due to anticholingeric effect?)

(I take all on different days, bromantane everyday 25mg powder)

Also if someone mixed with phenibut and has experience let me know.

I tried with ALCAR but it made me emotional as fuck and I felt kinda weird (probably due to high serotonin)

I tried with weed but it doesnt mix well, makes the weed high very ""dirty"" and you feel too amped up in a weird way.

This seems like a very logical conclusion given testosterone's ability to cause muscle hypertrophy is done through mtor. Dr Alan Green frequently states that doign Rapamycin and waiting a full 2 weeks for it clear entirely from the body is the best way to do it. the idea is to not allow Rapamycin to disrupt torc2 through chronic use at high dose levels. So I was going through some ideas and wanted to ask this community what their thoughts were on some of these stack ideas that I came up with.

To start, Rapamycin would be dosed high 1 time every two weeks at between 9 and 12 mg.

Meal restriction and low carb meals for the first week. Starting the day with high intensity interval routines. Multiple muscle group exercises and lifts, HIIT cardio, etc. One could use MCT oil, green tea extract, highly purified  Anthocyanins , Grape Seed Extract, Spermidine (perhaps nasal spray since it is so water soluble and low molecular weight) other thermogenics, lemon juice and others come to mind to aid with burning calories and Autophagy. Epicatechins could be used as well to inhibit Myostatin and increase Follistatin and preserve muscle. Ursolic acid could be used as well. Anyone think that some of these should not be used? How about others that are similar ... anything come to mind as a suggestion?

Bemethyl in the first week with daily 500mcg to 1mg skq1 injections with preloading

The half life is somewhere around 80 hours if I remember the information from a video that I saw correctly. Sometime after half life happens nutrition and work out plan can change. I was thinking a week in switching to a fuller diet with low glycemic carb sources, whole grains, etc would be a good idea. When this happens work out could change to something that doesnt enhance metabolism and Autophagy as much. Strength training and/or time under tension work outs could take place of HIIT. Test boosters should be used through out, but should they be increased when they will matter mroe.. in the second week? Doubling test enhancers like Fulvic acid/Primavie/Shilajit and Cistanche in the second week would cause increased production to help facilitate more growth in week two. Of course this wont translate to many gains but it could be optimal for retaining muscle.

Week two could also have ipamorelin and cjc no dac thrown in. Inject first thing in the morning, work out, wait half an hour, eat meal. As long as one fasts for at least 3 hours before second injection, then works out 2nd time after, and waits thirty minutes before eating last meal of the day then they should be fine. Any objections or suggestions? Any other peptides come to mind?

Epicatechin and  Ursolic acid probably wont be as needed in the second week if you want to be thrifty or if you arent really looking to put on more muscle and would rather simply maintain.

Something else that comes to mind are the different PPAR activators. Perhaps using in the first week low dose would be okay.. anyone see reasons not to or think particular ones should be avoided or used?

It behaves similarly to that of Phenibut with the exception of being roughly around a couple magnitudes more potent of a gaba-b full agonist. This makes it appealing to people who are chasing stronger highs and drugs that require less to achieve more euphoria. F-phenibut not only is an addictive drug with the same addiction liabilities as normal Phenibut but also possesses additionally negative aspects such as inherent Neurotoxicity.

This toxicity is mediated through potassium pumps and potassium channel inhibition causing brain damaging via potassium influx. It may also through a similar mechanism disable or irreversibly damage/deactivate the gaba-b receptor sites that the drug binds to. This may cause irreversible gaba-b receptor damage. 

This is unique to Fluorophenibut and doesn't seem to share with Phenibut in these properties. It is proven to be neurotoxic through the studies provided below. Additionally there have been reports of potential heart damage from fluorophenibut is just further reason to stay as far away as possible from this compound.
