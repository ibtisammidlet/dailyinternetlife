If you don't like that idea, you can try Ashwagandha, which I found to make me not give a fuck, making it easier to be outside my comfort zone.",1646511859,hzhpxda,t3_t7fmk6,t3_t7fmk6,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

There is Scottish women who has FAAH inhibitor mutation that prevent her from experiencing fear, anxiety and depression; you can take those to maybe get a fraction of her power.

Tubunnn,"Dude, first thing I would do if I were you is lay off the weed immediately, it's detrimental the more you use it. If you keep smoking weed, no drugs can help you. Matter of fact, you're literally experiencing those two negative symptoms of cannabis.

As for a list, I tried a ton, that includes vitamins, amino acids and essential minerals + some exotic ones. I tried my best to hand-pick it for you, here is the list:

\- Dopamine

* First stack: L-Tyrosine / DLPA + Bromantane.
* Second stack: Uridine Monophosphate + Alpha GPC / CDP Choline + Fish oil (Mr. Happy's stack)
* NAC + Vitamin C
* Agmatine Sulfate

\- Serotonin

* St John's Wort (Highly interactive, check for interaction before use)
* L-tryptophan
* Ashwagandha
* Inositol

\- Acetylcholine

* Alpha GPC / CDP Choline
* Racetam (Tried 5 of them, Coluracetam, Aniracetam, Fasoracetam work for me, you might be different)
* Huperzine A (Dosage can be tricky, works great though)

\- GABA

* Black seed oil (nigella sativa)
* Ashwagandha
* Fasoracetam
* L-theanine

\- Endocannabinoid (FAAH Inhibitors, very promising)

* Maca
* Echinacea
* PEA (Haven't tried yet)

\- Temporary relief

* Cold shower
* Wim Hof breathing method
* Jogging

My take on you case is this:

You're experiencing negative symptoms from marijuana use, it will no doubt take a while for your brain to recover if you do decide to quit.

By trying these nootropics, you're shooting in the dark; you have to also have to make sure you're not deficient in any Vitamins or Minerals because it'll be the foundation of the efficacy of those drugs.

Talking from my experience. Cannabis will fundamentally fuck with all of the mentioned neurotransmitters, brutally; and you need a healthy systems of those to function and feel normal.

I've been a year sobered from a 2 year constant heavy smoke streak, and I don't even feel remotely happy compare to before smoking. Now I just feel dumb as fuck, from straight A nerd to 3 times college drop-out during the time. If you are going criticize me for not controlling myself and blaming smoking for my mistakes like those ""stoners"", I don't got time for that. Just listen to me this time man, it'll save you a life time of suffering.

All the best to you. Good luck!",1646530876,hziv093,t3_t7fmk6,t1_hzimchr,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
Tubunnn,"I haven't really tried that much tbh, sorry man. I've only tried maca and echinacea but I love the result. I tried both of them together so not sure which on has more effect, I would try them separately tomorrow. In the near future, I will cop a bottle of Jiaogulan and PEA. High hope in the PEA though.

Wow, some of them are dangerous? Thanks for stopping me from killing myself. It would mean a lot if you can tell me which one I should be more cautious with.",1646539072,hzjb64y,t3_t7fmk6,t1_hzj83tq,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Yes it applies to all GABA ligands except NAMs (which can cause other probs similar to benzo withdrawal if they're not titrated carefully, this applies to flumazenil). 

The downregulation is use dependent, so microdoses of GABA PAMs and agonists will still do it, but far less. I don't recommend phenibut, baclofen, benzos, Z-drugs, valproate, etc., even picamilon to anyone.

Some substances with GABAergic activity may compensate with other mechanisms for these effects. Rosmarinic acid and taurin come to mind and I do use them from time to time in very low doses.

I have no fear, no anxiety, but also no motivation. I'm sure that's too much GABA, but you piqued my interest with this mutation.

I benefit from Maca thanks to histidine, a precursor of histamine which reduces GABA.

The real thing that helps me is nicotine (nicotinic receptor that inhibits GABAergic activities via calcium influx or something). My smoking years (cigarettes only) were the best in terms of overall feeling.

But I don't use it anymore for other complicated reasons, so I'm looking for nootropics that work on nicotinic receptors. I know sirsadalot is also studying on this.",1647941430,i1n3j98,t3_t7fmk6,t1_i1n2h3x,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
