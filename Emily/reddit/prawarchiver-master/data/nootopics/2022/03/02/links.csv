I have played with all of them in different capacities.

I'm curious what others, more specifically using bromantane (and perhaps even sirsadsalot's nasal spray as I am), are combining it with. 

I ask because I tend to not respond well to stacks. Rather than things synergizing, I often experience a biochemical clusterfuck and my mood drops a lot. Today for instance, I took one 9mg spray of bromantane, and later on took 1,500mg of ALCAR. I passed out and became very dissociated for many hours, quite depressy.

What combos have people had success with? Thanks!",False,t5_4aoxhu,What Are People Taking Bromantane With?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4uidh/what_are_people_taking_bromantane_with/
