sirsadalot,"I've done up to 400mg orally. Granted this was oral so the potency was likely reduced, but I felt both stimulated and emotionally flat. Hard to describe, but it wasn't pleasant. Yet I was highly locomotive.

I've tried 150mg sublingual and 18mg instranasal via the bromantane nasal spray and in both cases I get pleasant stimulatory effects.

Really what I like about Bromantane are the after-effects, and this might be odd to remark, but I almost feel like there is a delayed stimulation that occurs minus the acute anxiolytic effects from the GABAergic mechanism (probably downstream of D2).",1646341619,hz8e84v,t3_t5uzto,t3_t5uzto,10,False,t5_4aoxhu

I did Bromantane up to 400mg and didn't experience much but read it has a cumulative effect.
Hoping it works soon anyway but don't know if I will compound a problem.

I think I messed up badly with BPC 157 trying to heal GABA receptors from Phenibut and benzos. 

Took 3 doses and got Anhedonia from it I think and I just quit Phenibut and had enjoyed music for first time in ages.
 I had a degree of Anhedonia anyway just read some stuff it could be permanent and hope it ain't true I was giving yday and today I was really foggy, nauseated, had headache etc.

I don't know if it's lifting or not but I feel really anxious ATM and was feeling better with that too. Now I feel I've gone backwards and was too good to be true this past week almost normal.
Does anybody know if this is permanent? I'm now back to worrying and emotional.

Hxmusa,"Hey man I was also addicted to phenibut and a variety of gaba drugs/nicotine etc. It got to the point where I had anhedonia too and needed them to feel some sort of joy whilst doing anything and even that stopped working. 

I started off by quitting phenibut but I was still vaping like a chimney. I then introduced Bromantane in to my life. It helped with so many things. I had a reduced desire to smoke and also an increased desire to WIN. 

I felt so motivated on the DAYS AFTER dosing Bromantane 3 days in a row especially after around 12pm. I felt like I was on some sort of Amphetamine at times on them days as I have tingling body euphoria, increased sociability, reduced anxiety, increased strength in the gym, more focus and more enjoyment of music.

I haven‚Äôt dosed Bromantane for around a week and im having stronger effects every day. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs almost permanently there in my system I love it. 

It also reduced the desire for me to seek out substances and supplements as I no longer had the urge. 

You said you had anhedonia but Phenibut is pretty well known to give anhedonia for at least 10 days after  you quit. Wait it out, take the Bromantane, maybe lower the dose and more isn‚Äôt always better. Less is more with this. Start off at 50mg sublingual for 30 minutes minimum or just for convenience, use the spray and wait around 2 hours for effects. They should be slightly noticeable.

Infinite_Employ3379,"Hi thanks for the reply so much I didn't know I posted this successfully as it glitches and think a section for pasted in reply to a comment. I'm doing Bromantane (started yesterday that I bought to help feel decent permanently) but its capsules due to being unsure if it will get through customs (pyschoactive substance law in UK) and all the expense with additional charges.

I'm glad to hear things got better for you and caused really positive effects.
Someone suggested stopping Phenibut may have kindled me with the benzos withdrawals.

I have other peptides coming and I don't know if I will use them now after this experience.
I'm not spending any more money after this on stuff except the good supplements I need like vitamin d, NAC and Agmatine if that starts working again.

Anyway I will try doing what you suggested it's a pain dissolving filler wish it was pure powder or liquid. Stock is running out as well atm so guna have to make a decision if I need try risk importing.

Will be second day today of Bromantane (was doing 100mg due to it not dissolving how I wanted)and hope it is 3 days in a row and kicks in. I'm taking l-tyrosine as well now to help it along the way. 
The only substances I seek now are to speed benzo withdrawal or at least have an impact anyway.

I think I learned the hard way as usual about peptides, and I am aware of the Phenibut Anhedonia it just felt like it was getting better over past 7 days and interestingly you mentioned vaping I got a slight buzz every now and then from vaping. 

I don't have a lot to play around with as it is expensive sublingual is definitely the way to go. I take sublingual buprenorphine.
I honestly never really noticed much with Bromantane but could have been the form it was in (never dissolved properly) last time and hoping like mad I notice something this time at least. I'm not being defeatist just past experience.

Possibly I should have stopped when feeling good. The only worrying thing was someone in this thread said BPC 157 affected Yohimbine for them (I can't see the post any more) and if it did it is the same receptor Agmatine uses as well as others.

I don't know how to direct message them tbh. I'm hoping that as I used 3 doses over 2 days it isn't permanent but reading what he put concerns me. I want to see if his/her Anhedonia lifted anyway.

I felt Agmatine was best till I messed it up tbh. That actually had me in remission and I can't take it now as its effects were still blocked 2 months + on after taking that BPC.

Infinite_Employ3379,"That's good to hear are you in the US? They are cracking down on nootropics aren't they I'm sure you would have heard probably before me in the UK.

If you need it maybe best stock a little up although probably no need to panic buy lol. Some European sites have it I believe. Wish MondialK were still around I ordered once and it was fantastic. At least ATM if you live there you can still get some domestically. 

I do have a bigger stack than that. Have all sorts but my go to ones now are NAC, Agmatine, Vitamin D, various magnesium (trying l threonate for plasticity). It isn't cheap but cheaper than some things. Also CBD and CBG I find effective, theanine a nootropic complex with methyl vitamins and co factor forms.

They are the ones that I can pinpoint help. Bacopa too for upregulation of GABA which I heard helps most when off benzos completely.

Also yes Bromantane is quite safe and benign as far as I understand anyway. I lost enjoyment from Phenibut and had an easier ride down thanks to Fasoracetam. I feel better talking to people who have been through things too. I was fine with benzos then one day I took fake tabs and messed myself up.

Infinite_Employ3379,"Sorry to hear that. Anhedonia sucks. 

I think that's why I liked phenibut tbh as it both annhiliated anxiety as well as made me feel good or used to do anyway. 

Do you have anxiety issues as well? 

It is pretty common for you to experience worsening of Anhedonia as phenibut releases a lot of dopamine and then crashes in withdrawal. It also hits Gaba B (anxiolytic) and VGCC's like gabapentinoids. 

Are you looking to stop phenibut now?

Or have you tried anything to reduce your tolerance like Agmatine or Fasoracetam? 
The latter helped me quit. I would be stuck on 2 scoops or 2g ish still now I think if not. 

Both were miracles for me that unfortunately stopped working. My fault really but I will say I was too eager to heal from benzos as well as phenibut. Doing both withdrawals is awful.

If you are looking to cut down what have you tried? I assume you probably tried a few things but I'll see if I can help. Dopamine production is obviously the aim.

You probably already know but just in case:-
If you haven't tried Agmatine it is safe and helps dopamine. 
Bromantane is safe but didn't do much till higher dosages for me tbh.

I did take 9 me bc and that certainly felt dopaminergic but can't recommend over a safer alternative and there are other things Jiaogulan off the top of my head.",1657235129,if9s6u7,t3_t5uzto,t1_if9oq1l,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hxmusa,"Nope im british just like you, (Preston, near Manchester). I have had PAWS in the past yes but Phenibut related as I‚Äôve never been addicted to Benzos. 

For me, the more I cut things out, the better I felt. I used to take NAC and L theanine too but they both made me zombified. They helped with anxiety sure but at the cost of nulling my emotions, it wasn‚Äôt worth it for me. 

Agmatine was a massive help at the start though.

Infinite_Employ3379,"Ah cool I live within 25 miles of you then lol.

I always assume most talking about nootropics are from the US for some reason maybe just population density and thought maybe they were more prevalent there.

Well Phenibut PAWS is still Gaba related as well as dopamine so it's causes a similar withdrawal syndrome I would imagine. Maybe different in lengths of time and possibly more depression with Phenibut due to messed up dopamine as well.
Well done kicking that anyway.

Edit:- I'm going to stop ordering things. I ordered more peptides yesterday (for some reason). Then this happened.

Another reaction it could have been was a proprietary blend of sleep supplement as felt ok before that.
 I do feel a bit better today though didn't wake up with a spring in my step (Agmatine possibly)

Did you get your Bromantane recently and did you import it? Past year anyway? I'm aware stock is dwindling in some places and be good to have a European source tbh but seems limited.
