The question is: how would one insure agains glutamate/NMDAR-induced excitotoxicity when taking higher doses of D-Serine? 

For those that see benefits from D-Serine, plan to use it for an extended period of time, and may experiment with higher dosages, this question seems pertinent. 

There is some literature on NAC being protective against excitotoxicity as the cysteine uptake by glial cells causes an increase in extracellular glutamate, which causes NMDARs to downregulate, resulting in overall less calcium influx, limiting excitiotoxicity. I am curious about NAC and if this effect would effectively blunt the benefits of d-serine, or if this protective effect is independent of d-serine's actions (there is mention in the literature that NAC acts primarily on extrasynaptic glutamate, i.e. where d-serine is not acting (synaptic)).

Also curious if/which antioxidants could be reasonably expected to be useful in mitigating excitotoxic potential in higher-dose d-serine supplementation.
