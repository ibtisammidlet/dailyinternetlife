RyeGuy1800,"Have done some more research. It appears the actual pathology of excitotoxicity results from the increase in intracellular calcium causing damage to the mitochondria and other cell structures, resulting primarily in increased reactive nitrogen species (RNS), rather than reactive oxygen species. Seems that peroxynitrate is most implicated. Interestingly, RNSs are effectively scavenged by compounds containing **thiols**. NAC contains two thiols and thus may be effective at quelling the pro-oxidant effects of increased NMDAR activity and intracellular calcium.",1648504175,i2ho6cg,t3_tqbh7e,t3_tqbh7e,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

The-Swiss-Chad,Generally as far as I know d-serine is less likely to cause excitotoxicity. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is primarily mediated by nmda receptors not ampa. You can eather prevent excitotoxicity by using something like a NMDA antagonist like memantine or us potent antioxidents like you mentioned NAC or my personal favorite CBD.,1648496810,i2h6lqd,t3_tqbh7e,t3_tqbh7e,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Is there some other glutathione booster that also provides excitotoxicity protection",1648543044,i2ji9hm,t3_tqbh7e,t3_tqbh7e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Switch_23,"Interestingly, several lines of evidence disclose the role of D-serine for inflammation, excitotoxicity, and epileptogenesis. Inflammatory factors (such as amyloid Î² and lipopolysaccharide) stimulates the astrocytes and microglia to express SR (98, 99), thus these cells become the primary source of D-serine in inflammatory conditions (100). The amount of D-serine obtained by this way promotes excitotoxic damage and synaptic dysfunction through the activation of NR2 subunit at extra-synaptic sites (101). Transgenic mouse models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exhibit several-fold higher levels of D-serine in spinal cord, and the elevation positively correlates with disease progression (102). Moreover, D-serine increase in spinal cord was observed even in sporadic postmortem human ALS cases or ALS relatives (102). Furthermore, it may be of interest that SR knockout mice were protected against cerebral ischemia and excitotoxic damage (103). These findings suggest that D-serine, rather than glycine, may be a key determinant for NMDAR-mediated neurotoxicity.

RyeGuy1800,"I am going to make a post on this probably later today, but, as I have been looking into the literature on magnesium threonate, I have been confused by the consistent finding that it upregulates NMDAR activity (for example, in this [study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/42/14871)). Given that the way most people, including myself, think about magnesium is that it prevents excess NMDAR signaling, this finding is confusing. Any thoughts?",1648576090,i2lblej,t3_tqbh7e,t1_i2hqowu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

RyeGuy1800,"That leads to another point of confusion. In multiple studies, including [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309010447), magnesium threonate was found to upregulate NR2B NMDA receptors, which, as you have discussed and as has been found in numerous studies, are predominantly extrasynaptically expressed. Magnesium was also found to have no effect on NR2A NMDA receptors in multiple studies, which we know are the predominant synaptic NMDA receptor. So, basically, magnesium threonate has the opposite effect of d-serine, which increases activity at synaptic NR2A receptors, not NR2B. 

So, I think it is only natural to be quite confused by how magnesium threonate is found to be cognitive-enhancing if it essentially has the opposite effects of d-serine. And then, back to the original question, how can we understand magnesium threonate to be neuroprotective and/or limit glutamate excitiotoxicity if it upregulates NR2B NMDA receptors?",1648577313,i2les1c,t3_tqbh7e,t1_i2lc6ie,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Receptors normally upregulate after they're antagonized. Extracellular Magnesium antagonizes extrasynaptic NR2B.,1648577545,i2lfdna,t3_tqbh7e,t1_i2les1c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
RyeGuy1800,"That would make more sense. If glycine potentiates NR2B receptors as a coagonist, how would that play into magnesium supplementation? Would there be a point at which the increased expression of NR2B receptors from magnesium supplementation and the increased activity of NR2B receptors from glycine cause a net-negative effect?",1648580377,i2ln0oi,t3_tqbh7e,t1_i2lfdna,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
