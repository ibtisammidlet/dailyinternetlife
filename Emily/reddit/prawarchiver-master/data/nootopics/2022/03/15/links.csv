What has your experience been like with them?

**Check this post for more infos on how to asses solubility yourself:** [Easily asses compound solubility for IN administration!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teqhku/easily_asses_compound_solubility_for_in/)

**Short Summary of what the values mean:**

**LogP:** Everything that is **below 1 for LogP is More water Soluble.** Everything that is **over 1 becomes more Fat soluble.**

**LogS:** If i understood it correctly is how much is soluble in water. Generally here the rule is the higher the value the more soluble it is in water. Most medications are at around a -4 which is pretty alright and solvable. (**Correct if I am wrong on this**)

**Actually I just noticed** u/sirsadalot **has posted this** [Bioavailability post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/n8j3g0/the_oral_bioavailability_of_every_nootropic_84/) where he goes over oral bioavailability where often times for many of these compounds IN is kind off obsolete and he also often times mentions the LogP Values. **If there is demand for the list** to be continued I will do so, however I don't think it really is necessary. It also seems that generally a higher LogP value (more lipophilic will induce a higher Oral bioavailability.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Fat/Water solvability for IN administration of Nootropics!,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teujiu/fatwater_solvability_for_in_administration_of/
