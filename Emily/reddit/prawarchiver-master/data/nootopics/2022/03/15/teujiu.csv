25c-nb,"Sweet thanks for the info, I'm saving it for reference in a spreadsheet.

>Neutral 1.5-0.5

What compound are you referring to here?


Never heard of this sub so thanks for the link here from your post on r/researchchemicals, is there a reason you didn't post to r/nootropics as well? 

Not that I'm even subbed or browse there anymore, that place turned to crap and became filled with too many brodudes parroting the same crap like 

""dude don't do weed or other hard drugs it's harming your Chakra/screwing up your electrolyte blood pH micronutrient salinity plasma ion balance/ruining your circadian rhythm which you need to predict the emergence of cicadas/some other psuedoscience bullshit, all you need is sleep exercise diet and meditation and to take this proprietary stack of super basic supplements dosed at 1/4 the common dose, it's only $85 for 15 capsules, that's all I take and my life is perfect, I sleep 8 hours every night taking just magnesium and have a hot wife and perfect kids in a beautiful home with a 7 figure salary and I WFH... I used to be a homeless crack addict giving blowjobs at truck stops before I started taking this stack and fixed my life bro""

Or if you post about a more obscure nootropic like PPAP or CRL-40,940 or even something sensitive like fucking kratom they go:

""Brooooo what even is that? I've never even *heard* of that next chem bro don't take that stuff it could turn you into a zombie and ruin your life or make you brain dead omg that chemical sounds so scaryyy! Just take L-theanine and drink Starbucks coffee, take magnesium and melatonin for sleep, that and a Walmart multi vitamin gummy is all you need for laser focus, I write 3 essays a day just with this"" 


Or other nonsense and misinformation that becomes the most upvoted comment in the thread... 

So then maybe I know why you didn't post there lmfao but I thought maybe this was just my experience on that sub...

The-Swiss-Chad,"Yeah exactly like you say pretty much. Not just did I and u/sirsadalot which made the great bromantane and dopamine post get banned but they also just post so basic unexciting stuff like you mention usually about a few plant extracts and a healthy lifestyle which is obvious and one should be doing anyway. Thats however not the reason why somebody goes onto a nootropic reddit. r/NooTopics and r/NootropicsFrontline are definitely the best to see new stuff that are unusual and pioneering. So you found the right place now ;)

I actually, just linked this post on their subreddit and said they might be interested in it. It pretty much got instant taken down and I got instant banned, from posting to the subreddit and even from messaging the mods without a explanation why. (They have a ""beef"" with this subreddit (see sirsadalots post history for more information) which I was aware of, however I didn't think they would just instant ban you if it was something useful). It's stupid there is no reason to instant ban me a lot of r/Nootropics users might have been interested in this :/",1647527389,i10tbe1,t3_teujiu,t1_i10hjqd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"What is your thoughts on some people who get symptoms of peripheral neuropathy during their usage of 9MeBC? (Numbness, tingling sensations, etcetera)

I was speaking to a couple people who sudden had these symptoms once they began usage of 9MeBC. They have slowly been improving after cessation of usage, but it is alarming considering this is not spoken about very often with 9MeBC.",1652123769,i7yfkay,t3_teujiu,t1_i21qjy0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
