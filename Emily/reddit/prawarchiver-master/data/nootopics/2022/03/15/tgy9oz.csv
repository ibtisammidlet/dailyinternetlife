turbopowderer,"I haven't seen any sort of confirmation that pemoline isn't neurotoxic but I was surprised at how little withdrawal it had, might be an indicator that it indeed doesn't.  


anyways I would look into combining those 3 at low dosages at which you don't get undesirable effects, and adding ALCAR / histidine / creatine / whatever antioxidant  


low dose sulbutiamine might be useful, D-serine/ceylon cinnamon might be very desirable especially with modafinil depending on what effects you want",1648176642,i20nvyr,t3_tgy9oz,t3_tgy9oz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

The-Swiss-Chad,I already got the rest of my stack optimised and pemoline does look very promising as a stimulant of choice. Hard to source though.,1648210061,i21zxwn,t3_tgy9oz,t1_i20nvyr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Whatever_acc,"Modafinil very rarely causes SJS which is sometimes deadly. 

And caffeine is excessively peripheral in action",1647649958,i1839hm,t3_tgy9oz,t1_i1511ns,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
miroiter546,"I was on Pemoline for six years as a child/teen. Honestly - it was great. I could focus on tasks, but it didnâ€™t have any cardiac side effects. No dry mouth. No withdrawal. I have never taken any other ADD medication. So I cannot compare it to something like Adderall. But for me, it seemed to work wonders. A negative side effect was that it did destroy my appetite. I had to force myself to eat food.",1651616116,i77tf5u,t3_tgy9oz,t1_i15sshq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
