This is when I was heavily addicted to phenibut and was never taken with phenibut at the same time.

I was told it would be social and mood boosting but it was completely the opposite at the time. 

A few months clean from phenibut, I decided to give Fasoracetam another try and it feels amazing. It also changed in effects the more I use it. On week 1, the effects were primarily stimulating, it would help me clean the house and focus on tasks. From week 2 onwards, I’ve felt less stimulated and more relaxed, mood is elevated, an increased desire to socialise and I also feel light body euphoria very reminiscent of a light phenibut dose. 

I have to say with it synergises well with Bromantane too. I have tried it both with and without it. With Bromantane, it feels stimulating and I get a little hyperactive. Without it, im more relaxed. They’re both good in their own ways.

I just want to ask what’s going on here. Why is it when I was addicted to phenibut, Fasoracetam sucked but after my addiction was over, it’s fantastic?",False,t5_4aoxhu,My experience with Fasoracetam,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/th2g2g/my_experience_with_fasoracetam/
