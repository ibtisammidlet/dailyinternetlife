nutropicthunder,I was going to try it on bromantane.  What is your dose?  Would I be able to sleep on it?,1647626038,i16j0f8,t3_th2g2g,t3_th2g2g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,"Haven't had much effect from bromantane. It probably because you had decreased gaba signaling and increased glutamate signaling when you went off phenibut, meaning at that point you had a disbalance towards glutamate signaling adding a racetame on top which is inherently modulates glutamate receptors and increases their activity only making, brain fog, anxiety and dissociative feeling more likely. Dosen't suprise me sounds like glutamatergic excitotoxictiy OR at least glutamatergic oversignaling (the tripping and increase in anxiety). Now that your natural gaba has recovvered your neurons can handle the increase in glutamate signaling better from the racetam. Do your research before doing any kind of substances. As you can see they can heavily fuck up your brain if you don't know how they work!",1647688542,i19ojgk,t3_th2g2g,t3_th2g2g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
turbopowderer,"Well maybe your phenibut doses & tolerance were very high, because fasoracetam is quite excitatory and can cause seizures at high doses by itself already. even if you were at baseline in the moment because you had enough phenibut in your system to prevent withdrawal, your brain's adaptations that give tolerance would still be able to potentiate excitatory shit",1648203431,i21q3pb,t3_th2g2g,t3_th2g2g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

BurtonThescribe,What it did to you remind me of my current oxiracetam (plus noopept) feeling. I'm afraid if fasoracetam can be taken with noopept.,1648116905,i1wvetr,t3_th2g2g,t3_th2g2g,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,Isn‚Äôt noopept supposed to feel ‚Äútrippy‚Äù? I‚Äôve never tried it myself but I‚Äôve searched Reddit and some say it compares to a microdose of LSD in headspace.,1648117005,i1wvjej,t3_th2g2g,t1_i1wvetr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

The-Swiss-Chad,Thats also why I personally try to stay away from glutamateric noots that inherently modulate it's activity. Since it's a very fin line where you can have too much of it's activity and to little which are both toxic.,1647688846,i19ox12,t3_th2g2g,t1_i19onot,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

BurtonThescribe,"I do not feel so. But never tred of LSD, so can't compare. Still, It is perfect antidepressant for me. My mood is excellent now, I do sleep well, my focus increased and brainfog doesnt exist anymore. And oxiracetam makes me energic and even more optimistic. Without street drugs ""high"" Effect, but I need to rotate substances to not get addicted again.",1648119498,i1wywkh,t3_th2g2g,t1_i1wvjej,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,I know this is subjective but what is your headspace like with Oxiracetam and Noopept? Was thinking of giving noopept a try to see how it feels,1648150159,i1yxkcm,t3_th2g2g,t1_i1wywkh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Hxmusa,"Headspace means like how you‚Äôre feeling mentally when taking noopept. How you feel different, what has improved? Does music sound better? Do you find more enjoyment in things? Do you feel more motivated?",1648165725,i1zzoy5,t3_th2g2g,t1_i1zdh0s,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
BurtonThescribe,"Okay. By the first, I have no more brainfog. My focus really improved, im more productive at work. Also computer games feel intense, because of the increased acetycholine. Music listening somehow better, even started singing to it in the work xD My mood is much better, more stable and on increased level(until you overdose, then it makes angry). It also improved my sleep. I do go bed with 10mg sublingual for better sleep, intense dreams which I do remember afer waking up. It is now two months since started therapy, and I think noopept will stay with me, as base of all stacks. Yesterday finished last oxiracetam dose, today first of coluracetam (5mg sublingual) and my mood and focus is even better!

I must also mention that since 7 years i had full abstinence of alcohol and any other drugs changing my brain chemistry, which could make results better.

Edit: forgot to mention that my speech quality increased. I use more words. My sentences are longer(sometimes too long) and more complex. My sense of humor is much better
I always liked situational (spontanic) jokes, now I do it even better, and people appreciate it.",1648200445,i21mgxa,t3_th2g2g,t1_i1zzoy5,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
