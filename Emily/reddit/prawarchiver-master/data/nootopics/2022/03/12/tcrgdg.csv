sirsadalot,"It's Caprylic acid you want, not MCT oil.

The only reason I'm using Caprylic acid on Bromantane.co is because that's the only thing Bromantane would dissolve in that was viscous enough to be sprayed. It was a miracle that it ended up being safe, self-sterilizing and a good carrier through fatty tissue.

Vilename,"This is true. It's about using the opposite hand than your target nostril and the angle; you have to aim more towards the corner of your eye than upright, which seems counterintuitive, but is correct. You'll know it's right when you no longer feel the nozzle blocked by any tissue.
