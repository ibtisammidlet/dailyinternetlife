Rpnot,"ALCAR is in my top 5 supplements, but unfortunately it gives me some kind of hardcore garlic body odor when taken for 3 days in a row (around 500mg per day). It's not uncommon, search for ""alcar fishy smell"" on reddit.

I never though about taking it sublingually though. I'll try a smaller dose that way.",1647793135,i1f2obs,t3_tdgvje,t3_tdgvje,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

krobb_kross,">What could be the negative effects of this type of route of administration (ROA)? ALCAR is bitter, but the taste is pleasant for me, I like bitter flavors like lemon juice. Could the sublingual consumption of alcar damage the mental enamel, would there be a way to mitigate it?

Not really that bad tho, lemon juice is on par. Prolly just wash ur mouth out afterwards and be fine",1647239747,i0l79qg,t3_tdgvje,t1_i0l2nel,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Vigilant daily applications of stannous fluoride.

Yes I was wondering too if it's the TMAO, but I don't think so.

I was taking 1.5g+ of L-carnitine L-tartrate for months before without this issue.

Rpnot,"You'll feel the benefits for 2 or 3 months max if you are lucky.

Then you will hit a plateau and you'll start to feel like shit. 

So you will drink more coffee or whatever that produces adrenaline.

It's always the same scenario with people on keto. 

I recommend you still keep some carbs in your diet, even if you are the type of person who works better with fat as fuel. 

Many studies have proved that a bit of carb with lunch or breakfast enhance cognitive skills.",1647957002,i1nsm92,t3_tdgvje,t1_i1nrbmv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
