**IN administration method isn't anything new**, what is special about this in my opinion is the fact that caprylic acid seems to be a great IN carrier for fat soluble nootropics. He has popularized the usage of bromantane with caprylic acid and I would just like to add a few things on top of that and further improve on this and further our self experimentation!

**Bromantane is easily fat soluble** which makes it easily **solvable in caprylic acid**. I am not sure how he determined this, but I want to give you an **easy method of figuring out wether a nootropic is Fat or Water soluble**. If it is fat soluble you can use it in caprylic acid as a carrier if it is more water soluble I recommend a saline solution which often is used as a nasal decongestion agent in medical settings.

(I am aware that some of you already know this, just want to spread the word)

**If you want to skip doing it yourself, I have done a post with a list of a few popular noots and their values:** [Fat/Water solvability for IN administration of Nootropics!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teujiu/fatwater_solvability_for_in_administration_of/)

&#x200B;

**Traditional Method:**

The traditional way of figuring out wether a compound is water soluble is by figuring out wether the molecule can make hydrogen bonds (in german we call it WasserstoffbrÃ¼cken, so not sure if this english term is accurate) and/or if it is polar. If one of these two is the case it most likely is water soluble. If it isn't it often times is fat soluble. This is basic chemistry that I learnt in highschool so don't hate. Hydrogen bonding generally can be made by a molecule if it a hydrogen is paired with either the elements F, N or O. So if you have -FH, -NH or -OH in your molecule it can make hydrogen bonds and thereby is likely water soluble. Now the second factor that can also make a molecule water soluble is wether it is polar or not. If a molecule is polar it is water soluble since it aligns very well with the water molecule (which is also a polar molecule). Check this video to figure out wether a molecule is polar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CQe-\_PJU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CQe-_PJU4).

**Easy Method:**

Now I cam across a few issues when doing this mostly it was just a huge pain calculating electronegativity and figuring out all the hydrogen bonds which usually is very time consuming and draining.  So here is the easier method:

Thanks to the [University of Lausanne](http://www.unil.ch/) and [INTAS](http://www.cordis.lu/intas/home.html) (im not affiliated with them just wanted to give credit where credit is deserved). A software has been developed using AI that is able to pretty accurately predict fat and water solvability without you having to go the traditional way.

[http://www.vcclab.org/lab/alogps/](http://www.vcclab.org/lab/alogps/) \-> here is the link to the tool. I recommend the [Non-Java Interface](http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/) for quick access and results.

Here is a quick guide of what the values mean and how to use the tool.

\*\*1.\*\*So first figure out what nootropic/compound you want to analyze.

\*\*2.\*\*Find it on [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and scroll to 2.1.4.

\*\*3.\*\*You will get something like: C1C2CC3CC1CC(C2)C3NC4=CC=C(C=C4)Br (Bromantanes smile code)

\*\*4.\*\*Paste the smile code [http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/](http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/) in the SMILE section.

\*\*5.\*\*The tool will spit out something like:

Now what is important here is mainly whats below **LogP** and **LogS** can also be indicative.

Here is the **rule** everything that is **below 1 for LogP is More water Soluble.** Everything that is **over 1 becomes more Fat soluble.**

So as you can see simply based on that Bromantane is very fat soluable. Which is also true if we look at it from the traditional method. Just 1 hydrogen bond (very little in comparison to the whole molecule) and it does not look to be polar (to be fair haven't calculated it's respective electronegativity.

**LogS** if i understood it correctly is how much is soluble in water. Generally here the rule is the higher the value the more soluble it is in water. Most medications are at around a -4 which is pretty alright. (**Correct if I am wrong on this**)

""In the following diagram you can see that more than 80% of the drugs on the market have a (estimated) logS value greater than -4."" [Source](https://www.organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/logS.html)

And here is a comparison of the Values of something that is very Water soluble:

**Salt or NACL**

**I think if a compound has LogP value of around 1 then it might be ""okey"" soluble in both solvents. Please correct me on this if this statement is wrong. I am aware that we have some chemistry geniuses among us.**

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER/PRECAUTIONS!**

Keep in mind these are **estimates** and will **not be 100% accurate**, but this will help you gauge a compounds solubility without having to try it out. Also if you plan on trying to **administering a compound intraNaselly** do not crush up the medication/noot if it is in pill or capsule form, they **often times have fillers** that may cause irritation and other issues when administered IN. Also keep in mind that **Pharmacokinetics** and **Pharmacogenomics will change when changing the MOA**, but generally these rules will mostly (**but not always**) apply. **IN = More local action, Higher bioavailability, Faster onset, shorter half life, less liver toxicity.**

Looking forward to hearing your reports of IN administration of Noots. Have wonderful day

**ps: This solvability question also helps with boofing :p**

Bierak,1647206521,self.NooTopics,tdgvje,True,22,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/tdgvje/sublingual_alcar/,1709901596,14,"According to a study linked in this subreddit, the absorption of ALCAR consumed orally is quite low, less than 5%, however in doses of 1500 mg it saturates the mitochondria. 

In the last week I have been experimenting with sublingual ALCAR  at a dose of 300 mg and the effects are quite noticeable:
1)Greater mental energy that allows more concentration. 
2) It also gives me an effect of peace of mind, and effect that allows me to be more focused on the present. It reminds me a bit of the cognitive effects of the Keto diet.

 What could be the negative effects of this type of route of administration (ROA)? ALCAR is bitter, but the taste is pleasant for me, I like bitter flavors like lemon juice. Could the sublingual consumption of alcar damage the dental enamel, would there be a way to mitigate it? 

To me I find this dosage method much better. 
A possible negative effect is that the day after not consuming it, a greater sense fatigue is felt, which is resolved with another dosage of ALCAR, it is as if the body were accustomed to this energy demands. 

Another subjective effect: there is a sensation of receiving more oxygen in the prefrontal cortex. This effect of ALCAR is very interesting, I did not perceive it that way with oral doses. I was just looking for something that could mimic the energetic effects of the Keto diet and I can say ALCAR could be a main part of a ""Cognitive Keto Energy Mimicking Stack""

Also don't know what could be the effects of 15 x 100 mg (1500 mg) doses spread in the whole day. I have not used more than 3 x 100 mg (300 mg) in a hour. 300 mg sublingual feels like a good dosage for cognitive effects.

To be clear, 1500 mg orally consumed does not have this cognitive effect compared to sublingual.
