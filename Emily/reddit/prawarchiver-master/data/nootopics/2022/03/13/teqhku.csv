gintrux,"/u/The-Swiss-Chad /u/sirsadalot consider 1% dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, as it increased bioavailability of intranasal rg1by about 6 times. Toxicity similar to chitosan.

Also, I was told I can make nanoemulsions basically with a few chemicals and repurposing ultrasonic toothbrush. But still haven't tried yet. This could also be a cool addition to improve intranasal bioavailability.",1647356177,i0r84b9,t3_teqhku,t3_teqhku,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,"Interesting stuff gintrux! I have trialed menthol myself and it seems to have good results anecdotally. Have you tried 1% dipotassium glycyrrhizinate or chitosan? Any other benefit to using them?

Menthol also has acute stimulating and strong decongesting effects which can also potentially enhance absorption. Which is also personally why I like it.

labratdream,"Well, well, well since our discussion months ago about ASIV and chitosan it seems that you have expanded on the subject :) Still I don't understand why tootbrush instead of nebulizer ? Cost ? Is it safe ?",1647542688,i11wqvd,t3_teqhku,t1_i0r84b9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
gintrux,You need ultrasonic homogeniser to make nanoemulsions. Ultrasonic toothbrush I was told can imitate it,1647549024,i12db32,t3_teqhku,t1_i11wqvd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,What do you mean nanoemulsion. You use it to micronize the compound ?,1647549078,i12dg3y,t3_teqhku,t1_i12db32,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
