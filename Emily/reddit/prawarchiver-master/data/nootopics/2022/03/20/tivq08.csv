Dangling_nuts,"The transport it blocks is the one that takes the dopamine out of the synapses, meaning without them the dopamine stays in the synapses longer, and thus more can accumulate. 

What you're thinking of, is if it blocks the dopamine transport to the synapses in the first case. The answer is no, how the dopamine gets to the synapses is not the same mechanisms as how it's taken out. DRI drugs only affect dopamine being taken out, inhibit that and you get more dopamine activity.",1647832087,i1hjc97,t3_tivq08,t3_tivq08,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"yes, if cyclazone is also a dopamine releasers and a TAAR1 agonist like amphetamines.. No for PPAP because that's mao B inhibitor

edit: I have no idea how PPAP would interact with NDRI's, thought it was an maoi like seleginine but it's an monoaminergic activity enhancer and different than other stimulants",1647846914,i1i5dmc,t3_tivq08,t3_tivq08,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
