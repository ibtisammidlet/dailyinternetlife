Reading up on recommend ways to learn a language, there's a concept known as [i+1](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis), or 'comprehensible input'. Basically, the idea is that you learn most effectively when you understand everything in a sentence *except* one piece of vocabulary or grammar.  
Now, there's this wonderful flashcard program out there called 'Anki'. It's commonly used by medical students and language learners to memorize tens of thousands of pieces of information in a (overall) short amount of time. It utilizes [spaced repetition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) in order to quickly commit large amounts of information to long-term memory.

If you do the math, on average, you'll never spend more than thirty minutes total on any given card in order to memorize that information long-term. And by long-term, I mean years. Anki does this by trying to guess when you're just about to forget the card, and showing it to you then. Each time you see the card at that critical moment, it reinforces the memory in your brain, making it last even longer. 

After a bit, the 'interval' for a card will reach the length of months or years, meaning you won't see it again for a long time. This is how medical students can memorize thirty thousand facts with this program, and not be overwhelmed. Because, even if they have thirty thousand cards, most of those cards are going to end up with an interval of months or even years, leaving only maybe 100-200 reviews needed per day.

  
Okay, so this is where I finally get to the point. There's this wonderful article I read recently about how to use Anki to learn anything. [Here's the link](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html). It's about a 20-30 minute read. I suggest you all take a look at it, because it's a stroke of pure genius. This guy talks about how he used Anki to build up an understanding of advanced fields of study that he has no background in (he writes news articles so he has to learn this stuff to report on it).  
He would make cards on things he could understand from whatever book/study/lecture/etc., and slowly quiz himself to solidify that information. Then he would go back through, finding something he was now able to understand that he previously was not able to, and then make cards on those. It's i+1; comprehensible input. Doing this, he was able to understand the research paper written on Google's AlphaGo, despite not having any background in the field. If that doesn't quite make sense to you, just read the article and he explains it much better than I can.  
If you read what he says, all this stuff seems very relevant to this community. I doubt anyone here would say they wouldn't like to have a better understanding of the science of nootropics. And this would only take a half hour to an hour of commitment each day to build up a better and more robust understanding.

Not only that, but you could commit to memory much more accurate information. Exact statistics, with the studies they come from included. An example he gave is this card: “What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?” (Answer: 48). This is information he has committed to long-term memory. It's very precise and specific, and he has done this for *thousands* of pieces of information. Again, I highly suggest you read the article, some of you may really like the idea.
