,"What is your opinion on nasal nicotine?   

Previously I had a good run with buccal (lozange) nicotine at 0.125mcg (1/8 of 1mg lozange). I can take it 2-3 hours before sleep if I need a boost to get things done during that period, and it won't affect my sleep. I consume quite a bit choline, and take ALCAR and Huperzine A, for ACh boost as well.   

So I think a microdose of nicotine gives a boost in norepinephrine, but also nicotinic ACh upregulation lasts longer, and has synergistic effects with choline and ACh boosters.  

I added nicotine base to my DIY bromantane spray, like you prescribed.   

1 spray is 10mg bromantane and 100mcg nicotine. I think this gives me the best of the two in one. I only dose once or twice per day when I work only, on a 5 on/2 off cycle.  

Now how do you compare microdoses of nicotine, combined with a good amount of cholinergics, vs Topisetron or GTS-21?

Would it be worthwhile to invest time and money to procure them and give them a try?

,"Thank you. 

Is there a source for Tropisetron that you can recommend?

I haven't heard of Tropisetron before, and already checked Pglchem :/",1648817937,i2z7s6b,t3_tte0pj,t1_i2z67xw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
