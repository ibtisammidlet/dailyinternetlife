The-Swiss-Chad,"Alright so first I just want to say anki isnt bad it works. However I personally still think it is too slow to learn things. I think you can do it faster. This is how I personally learn things even faster then with anki.

So first what makes anki sub optimal:
For one yes anki is better then regular flasch cards I agree.

The issue is if your gonna study with anki *usually you will have to create your own flasch cards to have them personalised to what you need. This takes time and IMO is too long.

Ideally you do the following which speeds up the process and allows you to learn and remember things probably nearly as well as with anki, but much faster.

For concepts I suggest you use a simplified version of the fayman technique. Its pretty brilliant, but so simple. So usually when you learn something your consuming the information through a medium like a book, video or whatever. Right after you consumed a part of it (or something important was said) you quickly stop and you basicly ask yourself: What did I just read/watch/hear? (depending on how you consumed it) Then you will have to repeat and reexplain the concepts in your own words in your head, this process imediately internalizes the information and allows you to recall it much easier then if you wouldnt have done that during reading. Its very powerful since you can also work with visualisation if your memory is more visual like in my case. Its also super fast.

(Important note to this technique at the end)

For vocabulary, facts and dates
Mnemonics combined with a memory palace IMO is the easiest way of learning vocab or numbers.  I think the guy in the article also mentioned heres just a quick overview of when and how I use it. I generally only use this technique for very difficult vocab usually the simplified fayman technique is enough.

Example word baobab
Medical Definition of baobab

: a broad-trunked Old World tropical tree (Adansonia digitata) of the silk-cotton family (Bombacaceae) with an edible acid fruit resembling a gourd, leaves and bark formerly used medicinally, and bark that is used in making paper, cloth, and rope

So if I wanted to remember this I say the world out loud in my head and see what the sound reminds me of in this case the word that comes in mind for me is boar. It sounds  similar to baobab imo. So the meaning is a tropical tree and the name for it sounds like boar. So I imagine a tropical tree growing from my ceiling with a boar hanging from it. Make the image absurd the more absurd the easier to remember. Now I just need to think of my room. What do I see? A boar hanging from a tropical tree which is attached to my ceiling. So I know the meaning is the topical tree and the name is going to be something that sounds like boar. The closer the word is the better to the thing you decided to take as your mnemonic the better. This train of thought allows you to sort of plant lots of hints within your brain to get to the word and thereby remember by not really actually remembering the word. 

But like I said the simplified fayman technique usually is enough. If...

Important: You should use noots that improve LTP and or memory directly. Thats very important. You need to have this otherwise you will struggle memorising things just by reviewing them once with fayman, but it works if you pay attention and actively try to memorise what you just consumed when you use the fayman technique with noots.

As you can see generally faster then anki. For people that still struggle even though they use these technqiues anki might be better.

Peace.

Also may I just point out I read the fayman technique over a year ago and I overtime forgot the name but remembered the technique. I just now when writing this I tried to figureout the name again and at first I came to freeman which was wrong and then to frayman. I read this in a article over 1 year ago! I fucking love noots. Allowed me to remember this by simply thinking back.",1648664329,i2qummo,t3_ts8zzh,t3_ts8zzh,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,Thanks for the discussion. All of us need to take in a lot of new information (because we’re interested in a budding field).,1648677240,i2rr3ls,t3_ts8zzh,t3_ts8zzh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"I will say, in the article it was said that the cards he uses are just really simple front and back cards. That's what I do and it doesn't take more than a few moments. Also, I've been considering combining the feynman technique with Anki in order to get the best of both worlds: periodic reminding to reduce memory decay, and comprehensive internalization. What noots do you take for LTP? I'm on Lion's mane and Synapsa (Bacopa Monnieri).",1648667522,i2r2qz4,t3_ts8zzh,t1_i2qummo,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
