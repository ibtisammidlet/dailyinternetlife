>Don't discuss about illegal, banned or scheduled compounds

I take it that means don't discuss sourcing something that's illegal/banned/scheduled in your own location? So, strictly for example because it's not really a nootropic but the guest I could think of, a Canadian discussing 3-mmc is fine (as it's available legally here) but a German or UK resident trying to find some is not ok?

Otherwise, it didn't specify where the compound is banned, presumably this is a USA based group so perhaps banned there? But how does that work with ones banned only in certain States?

Or is this saying don't talk about things that are obviously illegal like amphetamine or methylphenidate, and how does that apply to something like, modafinil for example?",1647746053,i1d1cq6,t3_thvmcy,t3_thvmcy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
