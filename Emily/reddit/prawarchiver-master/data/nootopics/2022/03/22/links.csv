Whilst my productivity has indeed gone up, I’m wondering if I can enhance it any further with nootropics. I’ve already tried Modafinil and Armodafinil, and whilst they are certainly effective, the benefit is modest only.

Out of all the remaining nootropics: PPAP, Bromantane and Phenylpiracetam appear to be the only ones that elevate dopamine. And they appear to do this through novel and unique mechanisms.

Before I part with my hard-earned cash, can anyone vouch for any of these? What was your experience like? And what dosage were you on?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Any experiences with Bromantane, PPAP, or Phenylpiracetam (for ADHD or general productivity)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/tkba5h/any_experiences_with_bromantane_ppap_or/
