sirsadalot,"**Abstract:** The neural mechanisms contributing to the arousal-eliciting actions of smoking and nicotine involve multiple neurotransmitter systems. The current study examined the role of opioid neurotransmission in modulating the neuroelectric- and mood-activating response to acute nicotine administration in overnight tobacco-deprived smokers. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design involving 18 (10 male, 8 female) overnight tobacco-abstinent smokers, spectrally analyzed electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and subjective reports of mood, euphoria, and smoking withdrawal were assessed in response to nicotine gum (4 mg) after pretreatment with placebo or with 50 mg of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. In addition to reducing withdrawal symptoms and increasing euphoria ratings, as well as subjective alertness in male participants, nicotine induced an EEG arousal response consisting of diffuse slow wave (delta, theta) amplitude reductions, frontal fast alpha wave amplitude increments, and elevations in beta wave amplitude, which were greater in female than in male smokers. Naltrexone attenuated the alerting and euphoric actions of nicotine but did not affect nicotine's ameliorating effects on withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine-induced frontal reductions in delta and global reductions in theta were prevented by naltrexone pretreatment, as were increases in anterior recordings of relative fast alpha. These findings suggest that the opioid system is involved in nicotine-induced subjective and neuroelectric arousal and implicate opioid-cholinergic interactions in the elicitation of these arousal responses to nicotine.",1653586264,ia39c4n,t3_uyctlc,t3_uyctlc,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
fsenerc123,This popped up I knew it had to be the good Sir providing another wonder post for us. Daily nicotine user here also with a history of opioid addiction - nicotine always interested me... excited to see what you discover,1653600937,ia48j3m,t3_uyctlc,t3_uyctlc,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
flammablelemon,"This was timely for me to read as I tried using a nicotine patch for the first time today. I used a really low dose patch (3.5mg) just for nootropic/studying purposes and wasn’t expecting to feel much, but within 30 minutes I felt a strong euphoric rush along with slight light-headedness, which I don’t get when taking most substances. 

Although kind of nice, it wasn’t at all the effect I wanted. A 24-hour 3.5mg patch over 30 minutes should only slowly release about 0.07mg of nicotine, so I’m confused as to how I felt such an overwhelming effect from such a low dose, when normally 0.5-2.0mg is used for cognitive benefits. After 90 minutes of wearing the patch I just felt tired and contented, which wasn’t helpful at all for working, so I took it off. Not sure if I should bother trying it again at a lower dose.",1653613010,ia4y43v,t3_uyctlc,t3_uyctlc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
25c-nb,"Read the abstract, thanks for posting this :) it's quite interesting so far! Will read the full study once I get home to my PC. 

The abstract leads me to wonder if naltrexone could possibly be used in concert with nicotine to taper a nic addiction and reduce or eliminate the desirable effects of the nicotine, in an effort to help break the psychological addiction as well as the neurological dependence? That's really cool. 

Naltrexone has such a positive impact on humanity! I would love to have been involved in the discovery of something like that",1653654185,ia6o5fq,t3_uyctlc,t3_uyctlc,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
lovejackdaniels,"Can someone do this for THC. I am emotionally blunt/ numb since childhood but when I take little doses of THC, my emotional quotient explodes for those few hours. I have so many thoughts and opinions and conclusions of things which I am not even aware of. If I start capturing all such thoughts I can probably write an autobiography about myself in under a dozen doses. Another time, I could write a great self help book or come up with neat startup ideas. 

In those few hours, I can even cry thinking about a specific event ( event is independent and not directly related to me). Everything seems interesting even the songs which I don’t bother listening twice (this is probably due to d2 agonism) 

Can someone knowledgable try to find what element of my brain chemistry is wrong in normal life and how can I manage it or even fix it like THC does. 

I did read some THC mechanisms. One possible theory could be I have few DA neurons in VTA and/ or large number of GABA neurons in this VTA region. 
Large number of GABA could be supported by my non emotional response to external stimuli. Nothing excites me or scares me. If I win a million dollars in lottery right now, i would still have to force a smile.

And yeah if it helps, I also have shit memory (long and short term), have no episodic memory (SDAM) and got diagnosed with ADHD-PI recently.",1653647845,ia6ek5z,t3_uyctlc,t3_uyctlc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
