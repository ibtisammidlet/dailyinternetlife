The-Swiss-Chad,"Im going to make a post about it, but in terms of pharmacological means. Some interesting ones are FAAH inhibitors, FROUNT inhibitors, Some non addictive gabaergics (Passionflower and apigenin), Neurogenisis promoting agent's (longterm SSRI usage / Cerebrolysin etc.) and another approach could be some substances that may cause fear extinction = HDAC inhibitors/Modfinil.

As you can see there are many options and each of them have their relative side effects to effects profile. There is also a lot of ""Techniques"" that you can try for example the pressure point next to your ear opening etc. Like I said I will hopefully make a post about it soon.",1652711095,i8tmtoe,t3_ujrp6m,t3_ujrp6m,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

darwinvsjc,"My general experience and following this topic for over 10 years 

Phenibut is great but use sparingly as addictive, with horrible withdrawals and ineffective when used frequently (once a week max)

Fasoracetam , Aniracetam and Phenylpiracetam are  generally low risk and popular choices in the nootropics community,  unfortunately they are hard to get hold of due to supply

Kava kava is a good alternative to alcohol 

Bromantane can also help 

Alpha-gpc and Hyperzine-a can help some people

Make sure you research and don't just take Reddit  feedback as fact 

Also from a phycolgical perspective try to understand why you have social anxiety, try and spot the triggers, hopefully bit by bit you'll get better at it

flammablelemon,"This is too reductionistic. Many neurotransmitters are significantly involved in social anxiety in different ways, including norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Fixing low testosterone levels (if this is a problem in the first place) is partially implicated in reducing social anxiety, but not all cases and it only works to an extent. On the other hand, very high testosterone levels have also been correlated with anxiety disorders.",1651912651,i7nnizx,t3_ujrp6m,t1_i7mjimv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Alright well you're free to think what you want but not only have dopaminergics and testosterone replacement been shown to improve social anxiety in healthy people, but in animal models testosterone boosts social dominance (with an inverse relationship to cortisol) and dopamine promotes social motivation and optimism.

Bromantane spray can reduce cortisol with a positive effect on testosterone, but fulvic acid as well can enhance testosterone quite nicely for as far as alternative methods are concerned.",1651892652,i7mvf2v,t3_ujrp6m,t1_i7mtvuk,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,Yeah the issue with other Bromantane forms is that oral only has a half life of 27.5% which may increase up to 3x with other ROAs and its half life is 4 hours which can increase 60x via IV for instance and IN is similar in concept. And sublingual can take up to 30 mins. So a nasal spray makes the most sense and I made one that's safest with Caprylic acid.,1651944802,i7p7db8,t3_ujrp6m,t1_i7p50p5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
