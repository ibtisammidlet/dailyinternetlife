The-Swiss-Chad,"You could have also just linked my post about solubility :P

How has your experience been with subl modafinil? Is the onset quicker? (Kind of a issue I don't like). Im considering making a nasal spray xD

Also not sure if this works for everyone, when I dilute agomelatine it still tastes nasty ;(",1652711389,i8tnhzq,t3_uotltz,t3_uotltz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
bmickeydeez,"I know this is a late reply, but you've got some amazingly informative posts on this subject dude - very much appreciated...especially to a scientifically-minded guy who over-researches everything ;).  Lately it's been about the differences in solvent types/ratios in solutions preps that aid with absorption/bioavailability/etc...",1653945034,ial74ak,t3_uotltz,t1_i8tnhzq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,Appreciate your kind words :) Another interesting thing I looked into recently and figured out is how you can use ph to increase a drugs hydrophilicity/lipophilicity and thereby also solve more into a solution and also increase it's bioavailability :),1655472460,icpgmyc,t3_uotltz,t1_ial74ak,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
bmickeydeez,Yes pH comes up all the time in publications on the subject! Can make a significant differenceâ€¦need to get myself some of those testing strips!,1655507843,icrtv8n,t3_uotltz,t1_icpgmyc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
