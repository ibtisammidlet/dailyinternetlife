25c-nb,"Sounds like 18mg is too low for you maybe, so sick with 36mg but try to follow the guidelines below.

To maximise the benefits to productivity and minimize the negatives and avoid tolerance build up/loss of efficacy:

1. Don't take it on the weekends for socializing, only take it when you are going to be productive

2. Only take it on days you need it to focus and be productive

3. Don't combine with alcohol or take it to get fucked up. Recreational use is different from functional use and using recreationally will make it less effective for functional uses.

4. Avoid taking it more than once per 4 days

5. If you do take it more than once per 4 days (e.g. 3 days in a row) take a week break

6. Try to eat properly, balanced meals not junk food or fast food.

7. Try to make sure you get enough sleep at night.

8. Take care of yourself in terms of hygiene like brushing teeth and showering

9. Try to take breaks when doing work, you still need it with or without the drug. When I'm studying I try to work for 50 mins and take a breif 10 min break, either just relaxing or doing something small that's menial but rewarding like tidying up a little. I find social media doesn't work well for this and it's too hard to stop and resume working as well but YMMV

Don't expect the drug to do all the work for you, it will make it easier to focus or give touore motivation but you still have to make the effort to stay focused and productive, you still have to contribute to staying motivated.",1651959095,i7q312g,t3_ukm340,t3_ukm340,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Ritalin really isn't that great. Instead I recommend low dose focalin or pemoline in conjunction with Bromantane nasal spray and ALCAR for dopamine upregulation and at night high DHA Omega 3s.

Other adjuncts to this process could be non dopamine related mechanisms such as AMPA PAMs like Piracetam or Idra-21, CX-1739 or nicotinic modulators like Tropisetron.",1651966414,i7qi3po,t3_ukm340,t3_ukm340,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alhakawati,"If I had to recommend a stim, it would be dexamphetamine instant release, it's the best of all stimulants, better than Adderall because it doesn't contain the levo amphetamine component, so much more smooth, aswell as better than ritalin, much more dopaminergic action when compared to Ritalin!

With all things that increase dopamine in the brain, whether it's amphetamines/phenidates, I would preach that there a few laws of biology and neurology when it comes to these substances.

The first being:
Your brain doesn't like too much dopamine, because in higher amounts dopamine can be neurotoxic, so your brain in response to the high amounts of dopamine circulating will downregulate the receptors and increase the dopamine transporters, so continued stimulant everyday use without dose escalation will result in a lower baseline of dopamine and if you miss a dose you won't feel very good! So its always best to take frequent breaks from stimulants, 2 to 3 day or more a week breaks, to help reduce tolerance and give your brain a break from the oxidative stress and inflammation that amphetamines can put on your brain.


Second being:
Less is more, dopamine is like a universal currency in your brain that's constantly circulating, and if you continue to print out more of it, the currency of dopamine will lose value and it pretty much becomes like hyperinflation, dopamine will be worthless and you won't feel anything, the worst case is stimulant abuse anhedonia which is pretty much that!


Third:
Stimulants are a double edged sword, you can develop and break habits much more easily because dopamine is also the neurotransmitter that can create habits and pretty strong pathways to developing habits, so do productive things when you take your ritalin, and do things that you want to turn into a habit when your on ritalin it will make it much easier to form good habits! Aswell as avoid porn and fapping on ritalin, a big waste of dopamine aswell as people who take stims and fap, often will become addicted to it, you don't want to be like those degenerates who have their own Fap cave, fapping 12hours a day and doing nothing else! 


Fourth:
There's this pleasure and pain homeostasis going on in your brain, after the ritalin wears off, you may feel abit down, because your brain was just in the pleasure part and now it will go to the pain part! Also happens on days off too, for me it's not bad anymore, I take allot of chems and use allot of protocols to keep my mood/motivation up on my days off, 2 very effective things are cold showers/ice baths puts your body in pain so your body releases norepinephrine and dopamine 530% and 250% above baseline because of the pain and pleasure balance so you can use this pathway to help migitate the dopamine low after the ritalin has weared off!


Fifth:
Sleep and diet and healthy excercise is super important, aswell as sunlight/vitamin d3 this will help the ritalin work much more efficiently and the sunlight will potentiate the effects of stimulants aswell, sunlight/vitamin d3 do some amazing things to the dopamine system! I also take high Epa fish oil,longvida Curcumin, ibuprofen, b vitamins, Alcar to support the amphetamines, really helps boost them aswell as migitate the inflammation that can happen with amphetamine use.

I also have 9 me BC and Bromantane as sort of an insurance on my dopamine system aswell as if I run out of my Dex.",1652078654,i7w3x96,t3_ukm340,t3_ukm340,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

virtualmnemonic,"18mg is really, really weak. I didn't feel much at that dosage. I took 36mg daily for a while and built a tolerance so much that after a month it was like taking a sugar pill. I came off it cold turkey and had zero withdrawals. 

Adderall is different IMO in that tolerance appears to plateau. The effectiveness of Adderall to me is not based upon how frequently you dose but rather lifestyle habits such as quality of sleep, diet, sunlight exposure, water intake, exercise, etc. These all things you should have down before even thinking of taking a stimulant medication, but sometimes stimulant medication is a necessity to actually do them (like cooking good meals and sticking to a workout routine.)",1652021385,i7swhwc,t3_ukm340,t3_ukm340,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
