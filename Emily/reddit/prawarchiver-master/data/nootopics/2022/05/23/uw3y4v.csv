yourblackluck,"Very interesting work, and definitely a drug I'd be interested in trying for several reasons.

One thing I didn't see you mention much of is the 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway', which is mediated by alpha-7 nicotinic receptors on macrophages and governs a lot of the vagus-nerve based cross-talk between the brain and the gut (here's [a good overview of the topic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430829/) if you wanted one). Anti-inflammatory properties are an underappreciated element in nootropic drugs, since inflammation can have such negative effects on cognition.

A bit of a nitpick, but antagonism of alpha-7 nicotnic receptors often does not impair cognition since the receptors are quick to upregulation. You mention memantine, and alpha-7 antagonist, and while early in treatment it can cause sedation and cognitive impairment, it often results in improvement in cognition after a short period. Likewise, the lack of sedation/cognitive impairment in bupropion is not 'proof' per se that alpha-7 is more involved in cognition than the nicotinic receptors that bupropion drug does block.",1653344600,i9qkg2n,t3_uw3y4v,t3_uw3y4v,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"At most I expect it will increase anti-depressant effects. Coincidentally I just took my first 5mg dose while on an SSRI, but this was just 20 mins ago so can't comment on it yet.   


The problem with SSRI's is that they non-specifically just increase serotonin all over the brain. There are 7 different types of serotonin receptors and some of them even have sub-types (e.g. 5-HT2a, 2b, 2c). We know now that for anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effects some of these receptors should be more stimulated (which is what the SSRI does by increasing serotonin), but a lot of them should be less stimulated (blocked/antagonized), while an SSRI just stimulates all of them. In that way an SSRI actually prevents a lot of good effects that it produces by stimulating the right receptors, by also stimulating the wrong receptors.  


Tropisetron antagonizes 5-HT3, which is exactly one of those receptors that you would want to block. Tropisetron thus will block the stimulation of that receptor by SSRI's and in that way will probably increase the anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant effects.  


It should be completely safe as the only interaction is that it reduces the effects of an SSRI on 5-HT3 receptors.",1668273452,iw3c9tp,t3_uw3y4v,t1_ivd7xh8,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

yourblackluck,"Memantine has gotten looped in with nootropics because people often have really positive effects from it. You can sift through /r/nootropics and /r/MemantineHCl and find lots of reports of neurotypical people getting enhanced cognition from it.

It is unfortunately understudied in neurotypical humans - most human studies are for people with dementia, and a few for those with ADHD. These latter studies (such as [this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30663824/)) do suggest to me an application in neurotypical people, as the mechanisms underlying ADHD more reliably scale upward past 'neurotypical' into 'enhanced cognition' than with dementia.

The real force behind my argument comes from rat studies though. There have been several that show cognitive enhancement from memantine in normal mice. [Here's one](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00073/full) that specifically addresses the alpha-7 issue:

>Another explanation for the interaction between memantine and PHA-543613 involves alpha7 nAChRs as the same target of both compounds. Taking into account that memantine is also an antagonist of the alpha7 nAChR while PHA-543613 is an agonist of the same receptor, their additive effects might be explained by the agonist-induced desensitization effect (Quick and Lester, 2002). In their commentary, Banerjee et al. (2005) also refer to similar effects of alpha7 nAChR agonists and antagonists, and imply that antagonism or desensitization of the alpha7 nAChR may result in beneficial physiological and cognitive effects.

[Here's another one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128866/) that discusses a few alternative explanations for the effect:

>Memantine has actions other than NMDA antagonism that may also account for the effects observed here, such as antagonist effects at 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (Rammes et al., 2001) and α7 nicotinic receptor channels (Aracava et al., 2005). In addition, memantine has been reported to increase brain-deprived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA (Marvanova et al., 2001). Of consequence, BDNF enhances the induction of long term potentiation in the hippocampus (Figurov et al., 1996). Moreover, an interaction between BDNF/trkB signaling and NMDA receptors has been found to have an important role in the development of spatial memory in the hippocampus (Mizuno et al., 2003).

The BDNF connection is interesting, and seen in [this other study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22205542/) where memantine is used to combat opioid addiction. If that were the main mechanism behind its nootropic effects, then it does not show that alpha-7 antagonism is itself nootropic but at least that it does not interfere with nootropic effects from other mechanisms.

Another possibility, I'll grant you, is that memantine's potential therapeutic effects on disease states are so broad - dementia, ADHD, addiction, OCD, anxiety, nerve pain, etc. that most people present with a subclinical form of at least one of these things, and memantine's apparent nootropic effects are actually just from treating these problems. But that may very well be true for plenty of alleged nootropics since human studies often have not-very-robust selection criteria.

As for my comment about bupropion, I guess another way to put it is this: bupropion, which blocks alpha-7 to a much lesser extent, does not cause cognitive impairment. Based on this, you want to claim that alpha-7 antagonism does cause cognitive impairment. However, if alpha-7 antagonism did *not* cause cognitive impairment, then bupropion would *still* not cause cognitive impairment - i.e. it would not cause cognitive impairment regardless of whether alpha-7 antagonism did have that effect or not.",1653409769,i9tobqm,t3_uw3y4v,t1_i9rs5ip,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"Oh yeah, you mean **low dose Memantine**. I've read that study before. So I can actually explain this:

Antagonizing extrasynaptic NMDARs enhances CREB (master learning/ memory protein) and prevents excitotoxicity (also mediated by extrasynaptic NMDARs). This is a valuable nootropic mechanism, and Memantine is somewhat selective to extrasynaptic NMDARs. But it's still a bit dirty, and the study you linked tries to prove this by *subeffective* a7 agonism alongside it.

The nootropic effect is definitely extrasynaptic NMDAR antagonism, though. No doubt about that.

Synaptic NMDAR antagonism is cognitively impairing, however, which is why I thought this nanostructured memantine selectively targeting extrasynaptic NMDARs would be more valuable: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988#:~:text=AuM%20is%20a%20selective%20antagonist,10%20%CE%BCM%20memantine%20(right).

I don't know when I'll be able to carry it but it's been on the back burner for a while now. Along with Neboglamine and CX-1739 (but I may just make Aniracetam Cyclodextrin instead).

As far as regular Memantine dosing, people always go too high and I honestly feel like whatever mild nootropic benefit a low dose would produce would be outclassed by Magtein which is also an extrasynaptic NMDAR antagonist, albeit indirectly by saturating with magnesium leading to more extracellular Magnesium preferentially targeting extrasynaptic regions. This showed nootropic effects in aging people which imo is pretty decent evidence comparatively.

Memantine is okay, I just think the dose discrepancy severely limits the payoff. And raving anecdotes aren't normally something I count as evidence (no shade, just explaining myself here) so this is why I'm not super hyped about it.

And as for ADHD, yeah that could be attributed to D2 agonism: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syn.20472

25c-nb,"Can you elaborate on why you think the nanostructured meantime would be worthwhile in humans? Just curious, that paper is interesting but mostly seems like a proof of concept for avoiding synaptic effects while preserving extrasynaptic effects, unless you have found further evidence of beneficial effects? I'm just intrigued by your interest in this compound so I'm looking forward to a discussion on that subject if your into it.

From the abstract:

> [Nanostructured memantine] exhibited neuroprotective properties both in vitro and ex vivo during such neurotoxic insults as NMDAR-mediated cytotoxicity in cerebrocortical cell culture and oxygen-glucose deprivation in acute hippocampal slices. 

This is interesting, in my book neuroprotective effects are always  welcome, but I'm curious how the neurotoxic insults they speak of would translate to the everyday life of a healthy human brain? Perhaps you think it applies moreso to mental health issues (which are thought to involve overhactivation of NMDARs, as you mention previously, IIRC)?

>Furthermore, [Nanostructured memantine] prevented dendritic spine loss triggered by Aβ oligomers in organotypic hippocampal slices and was more effective than free memantine

Now I have to do some research regarding this to be sure, but I think Aβ oligomers refers to the pathology of Alzheimer's, so this statement means the authors found evidence suggesting nanostructured memantine would have increased efficacy for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Think that would confer any benefits to non-Alzheimer patients (such as ourselves)? I guess that preventing any dendritic loss caused by Aβ oligomers, however little, is beneficial as well, healthy brain or not.",1653905446,iaj24kc,t3_uw3y4v,t1_i9tyorj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
