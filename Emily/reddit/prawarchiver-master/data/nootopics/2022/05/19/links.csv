Things are not as sweet as they may seem. Ever since I made this place, it and myself have been under constant attack by competing forces.

First of all I want to start this off by saying any mention of u/sirsadalot or ""[bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co)"" on r/Nootropics, r/StackAdvice results in immediate deletion. If you really want to tell others about my products, you should either privately message them or use different subreddits.

Furthermore, I am aware the r/Nootropics moderators are plotting something even greater. There are various ways they may attempt to slander me:

1. **Calling me a scammer.** First of all this is easily disprovable because I have fulfilled many orders and use a mainstream payment processor. Many people here can vouch for what I do.
2. **Saying I'm making false claims.** Everything I say is based on some study, and I never confidently say anything without proof.
3. **Saying I don't test my products.** I know this is the most common tactic they use, however I came prepared. In addition to having purity of testing, I do conduct third party testing here in the states for everything I sell, to ensure authenticity. I would never sell a bunk product.
4. **Misc.** Using their automod to brainwash everyone like they have done for other companies, astroturfing to spread negativity about my brand, etc. The bottom line is that I cannot do anything to defend myself from them and so it's an unfair situation.

The above user, u/MezDez, claimed that I was lying about the content of the Russian document I provided in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/) post, due to me not translating it to English for him to read. However I thought me translating the document would destroy its credibility, so I opted to just link the [original Russian book](http://library.lol/main/CD8E44AA817FFB656E936429BF0A8496) instead. At the time my hands were tied and I couldn't translate it for him. My good intentions here were taken advantage of, and he made me look like a liar despite my accuracy. I wasn't expecting people to have so little faith in me, but they did.

Nevertheless, here is the complete English translation for anyone interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the\_pharmacology\_of\_adamantanes\_full\_english/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/). I would never lie about this kind of stuff. Every claim I made in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/ufdwng/bromantane_spray_research_dump_shipping_prices/) is true.

As far as the r/Nootropics moderators are concerned, I am also curious how far they'll take it. They've already attempted to stop our small community by mass reporting, lying about our intentions and saying we harbor the trade of illegal drugs. This has resulted in my account being temporarily disabled multiple times, losing the NooTopics discord servers twice, among other things. We are working on getting [nootopics.org](https://nootopics.org) set up as a wiki/forum/blog, however that may take some time. Until then the only surefire way to never lose access to this community is through [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#server:nootopics.org).

This is after their failed attempts to say I'm a shill for my friend's company [pglchem.com](https://Pglchem.com). It is now obvious I am independent, and that's why I didn't take credit for John's company. Them banning me was unwarranted.

I am especially paranoid about the potential of them swatting me, doxing me, attacking my payment processors or other, more personal forms of harassment. I know they have my address because I was a past customer of ND and told MYASD my order number. I will refrain from condemning him of wrongdoing unless I have proof, and I have tried my best to not let this stuff affect my private life. I'm just saying it could happen. They have a lot of money and connections too.

If anyone has any advice for how I should handle this serious existential threat to our community, please let me know.
