A few days ago, I posted a question regarding a potential effect of nicotine use on the effects of tropisetron. In the questoin post, I also teased the potential of running a double-blind test on myself to test tropisetron's cognitive-enhancing and anxiolytic effects once it comes in. It is coming in tomorrow, so I wanna run a gameplan by y'all first.

Since there is a three-day weekend, I head back to work on Tuesday. Since this will also give me one week of a nicotine washout, that'll be the first day of the ""experiment"". I will buy five Tim Hortons Iced Capps on Monday night and leave them in the fridge for the remainder of the experiment. These iced capps have an unknown amount of caffeine that should remain constant throughout testing. I will have my roommate add either no, 5mg or 10mg of tropisetron to each drink, totaling one control, two 5mg and two 10mg sessions. I will not know which drink will have each substance (assuming a taste gets diluted). I will also take a baseline test on Monday night for comparison.

I will be testing working memory capacity through a dual n-back test, processing speed through a coding test (like ones found on IQ protocols), anxiety metrics through the Hamilton-Anxiety scale, and subjective effects from both myself and coworkers in regards to productivity and overall positive affect.

I understand that this is a very small sample size, but I am intending on using this as a pilot to determine if there are cognitive benefits to this substance. If there is, I will report the findings that I have experienced. Then, I will repeat this protocol for another five days the following week with 5mg and 10mg doses to determine which is the best dose and report back. Finally, I will take the dose of tropisetron found to have greatest cognitive effects in me for one month and report back any long-term effects.

In addition to the caffeine intake mentioned earlier, my stack right now consists as follows: modafinil 100mg in the morning (prescribed/Apotex), buspirone 10mg twice a day (prescribed/Unichem), Vitamin D 5000IU (doctor recommended/Nutricost), ALCAR (Nutricost), Vitamin K 100ug (Nutricost), magnesium glycinate 240mg (Nutricost), and lutein 20mg (Nutricost).

Is there anything else I should be looking for or keeping in mind? Let me know what y'all think!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tropisetron Double-Blind Report Proposal,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uyapd3/tropisetron_doubleblind_report_proposal/

A lot of the studies on tropisetron use nicotine-naïve subjects when testing intellectual function. I know that the tolerance of alpha-7 nicotine cholinergic receptors is completely different than the monoaminergic neuron transmission that I study and is used for many nootropics. Would there be an impact on tropisetron’s effects on those who use nicotine on a semi-regular basis (like one cigar a week theoretically)?

Also, for the curious, I ordered the solution from a vendor suggested by someone who’s username doesn’t have an honorific with an emotion they have quite frequently.  Im planning on doing a double-blind report with a modafinil, caffeine, and ALCAR stack with n-back, verbal recall, anxiety-reducing effects and see if it’s efficacious. At least for a n=1 with this monkey. I’ll keep y’all’s posted with design and updates once it comes in the mail :)",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tropisetron for the non-nicotine-naïve,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uwwnwu/tropisetron_for_the_nonnicotinenaïve/
