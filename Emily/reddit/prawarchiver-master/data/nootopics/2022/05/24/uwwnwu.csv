sirsadalot,"Tropisetron does indeed work in nicotine and non nicotine users alike, due to targeting a7 whereas nicotines tolerance and primarily mechanism is a4. Additionally it is a strong 5-HT3 antagonist (its other nootropic mechanism) whereas nicotine is not.

There could be mild contamination at a7, as nicotine does have some desensitizing properties at nicotinic receptors due to its structure, however I don't think it'll be as prominent as say experimental a4 agonists.

Also lol as how you worded my mention",1653418072,i9u8f2a,t3_uwwnwu,t3_uwwnwu,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Cappin_The_Turtle,I would think tropisetron would still be effective in someone who semi-often uses some nicotine because nicotinic receptors actually upregulate with stimulation.,1653417771,i9u7pjr,t3_uwwnwu,t3_uwwnwu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
