flodereisen,"K2 MK-7 reliably increases libido for me, dose dependent. I think through modulation of testosterone.

Zinc, lecithin and B-vitamins together recharge libido after semen loss.

ozonelayerozone,"**Yohimbine**.

IME, yohimbine is shockingly powerful for the mental (libidinal) side, which you said is your main interest. You may well become a sex fiend for one to two hours. This is because it's an Œ±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; its MOA is therefore very different from that of most other supplements or pharmaceuticals in this space.

It's also pretty potent for the physiological side of things.

The major downside of yohimbine is that many ppl experience significant jitters / anxiety starting around one to two hours after ingestion, lasting maybe for another two to three hours. I therefore almost never take it. Also, it may make your heart thump.

If you buy it, make sure you choose a reliable brand. Some studies have reported that a lot of the yohimbine out there is adulterated with sildenafil, caffeine, etc.

Other options: **Tribulus terrestris**, high-quality **tongkat ali**, **maca**, **boron**. Generally, people take these over weeks, but you can take a double or triple dose of any of them and sometimes notice a libidinal boost within 30‚Äì90 minutes. I find tongkat ali and maca mildly stimulating libidinally, but don't like taking them on a daily basis because they both decrease cortisol (which will be a plus for some people but makes me drowsy). Tribulus and boron I like better.

**Panax ginseng** (i.e., Korean ginseng / Asian ginseng) can be very good too, but ppl react differently to it, so try it out first.

You've already mentioned nitric-oxide inducing supplements like citrulline. **L-arginine** is also good in that department. Or you can just take **sildenafil** / **tadalafil** / **vardenafil** / etc. (PDE5 inhibitors). Note that they increase testosterone and DHT, so they not only help with the physiological side but can help with libido.

In the pharmaceutical dopaminergics department, addition to the bromantane you mention, there's also **cabergoline**. Many ppl report increased libido. Has a very long half-life, for better and worse... I think you take it once or twice a week.

There's also **melanotan II**, which has an unusual mechanism of action, via the melanocortin receptors. Unfortunately, it causes nausea. I read years ago about some couple who would take it together, f\*\*k like rabbits, take a break to vomit, and keep going. Not my idea of a good time, but hey, horses for courses. There's also **bremelanotide**, which I believe is a metabolite of melanotan II and seems similarly to cause nausea. IME, mild libido boost + significant nausea. I think this kind of designer stuff is overkill and not worth the money.  YMMV.

But for libido, none of those compare to yohimbine. You may or may not feel a libidinal effect with any of the others, whereas I've never heard of anyone taking yohimbine and not noticing SOMETHING, whether they like it or not. It's like rocket fuel... be careful with it.",1653751304,iabkvob,t3_uzllq6,t3_uzllq6,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Looks like Bulk Supplements sells Yohimbe Extract and Nutricost sells Yohimbine. I've never tried either product specifically, but I've found those brands to be reliable no-frills suppliers of other supplements.
