Zdog54,Never tried homotaurine but I did use fasoracetam to upregulate the gaba b receptors. Personally I never felt anything from fasoracetam or had any side effects but it definitely reduced tolerance to phenibut when I was still using it back in the day. I was using either 100mg before bed or 20mg 3x a day. MYASD (nootropics depot owner if you don't know who that is) has said that if you are trying to upregulate your gaba receptors then taking 20mg 3x a day is the best way to take it since it will have steady plasma levels throughout the day.,1653128669,i9fof2s,t3_uuh24m,t3_uuh24m,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

shitpostasswipeman,What’s a good source for homotaurine? I’m willing to buy some and trial it. Fasoracetam didn’t do much for me either.,1654366852,ib63nid,t3_uuh24m,t3_uuh24m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,When you convert the mouse dose from the gaba b upregulation study you get something like 1200 mg / day for a 70 kg human. I see no reason why such low doses people recommend would work at all.,1653168442,i9hsj4r,t3_uuh24m,t1_i9fof2s,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
andalusian293,"N-acetyl tramiprosate/homotaurine, yeah.

The documentation suggests otherwise, but I'd be a little surprised if there wasn't some overlap.

How does it feel, subjectively?",1653179348,i9id1yx,t3_uuh24m,t1_i9icr5k,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
andalusian293,"There's really only one in the states, though there's another brand available on Amazon in Europe and Canada.

The name is cheesy, but by effect it seems legitimate; it's from a company called supersmart.",1654367103,ib644b8,t3_uuh24m,t1_ib63nid,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

fsenerc123,"Well I think I read it described somewhere as a novel benzodiazepine site activator (?) with no intoxicating properties. 

I have a history of massive abuse of GABAergics - I’m afraid to take a higher than prescribed dose of the acamprosate (666mg x3 a day I think) because of a possible negative effect. 

I went through and am still going through hell from massive alcohol abuse, etizolam abuse, phenibut, and others. PAWS, kindling, social ineptitude, glutamate hell. All that.

As to how does it feel: I believe it does kind of give me that sort of benzo sense of time flowing easier and it seems to reduce glutamate based on my subjective guessing",1653179681,i9idny8,t3_uuh24m,t1_i9id1yx,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
shitpostasswipeman,Yes I’m actually looking at that brand right now. Do you think their site is legit? It’s dirt cheap too. $7 for a bottle.,1654367690,ib656r0,t3_uuh24m,t1_ib644b8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
andalusian293,"I did a bit of that... I dunno if I'd call my issue massive exactly, but I seem highly susceptible to the negatives of all that without even overdoing it.

I kind of suspect being on a bit of a neuroleptic is really making it all oddly worse.

I'm interested in seeing if acamprosate would help, but I've got no obvious access. Tramiprosate is still a thing though.",1653179966,i9ie6ms,t3_uuh24m,t1_i9idny8,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
