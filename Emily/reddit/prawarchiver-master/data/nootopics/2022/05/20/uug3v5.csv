Welp, I paid the price and woke up at 3am with stabbing lower back pain. Immediately took magnesium supplement in my cabinet and gatorade. But it didn’t help much. Couldn’t walk, sit, lay down without thinking about the pain and it was intense. I threw up a bunch too and was lethargic. Might as well just pass a kidney stone while I was at it! 

Almost gave up and was considering taking ibuprofen and just going to the ER. Then I did some last minute research and it was said White Willow treats lower back pain. Luckily I had some in my cabinet as I purchased it in the past for headaches. Took 1500mg and the pain went away and I was asleep within 30 minutes. Pain has not returned the next day (so far).

Grasshopper110,"Hi OP, I know this is an old thread but you seem to have the knowledge and understanding in regards to white willow bark so I do apologise if this is more of an annoyance than anything, but...have you found any studies in relation to kidney or liver damage?

I understand that it is safer and healthier than using any other pain medication along with its other benefits, however I am quite interested in using this as either a day to day suppliement for longevity and back-pain or possibly cycling this - 1 day on 3 days off.

I found this while searching for some answers in regards to kidney and/or liver damage :

Salix daphnoides (Willow Bark)

The active constituent of willow bark is believed to be salicin. In vivo, salicin is metabolized to saligenin, which is further metabolized to salicylate (38,39). Salicylates are known to cause renal dysfunction, secondary to prostaglandin inhibition and a reduction in renal blood flow (40). Willow bark has been implicated in the renal dysfunction diagnosed on review of the autopsy of Ludwig van Beethoven (41). His kidneys were described as normal size and shape but with calcareous deposits in each calyx. It is believed that these deposits were necrotic papillae consistent with analgesic nephropathy (40,41).

Cappin_The_Turtle,"There are a lot of phenols and flavonoids present in white willow which are hypothesized to be the largest contributors to its effects.

As for the best blend, it seems to depend on your goal. For anti-inflammatory ability, a low-salicin (0-15%) extract seems to be best. For nootropic effects, a higher-salicin (15-30%) extract seems to be the most effective.

I think the absolute best range would be 10-30% salicin standardizations. A 24% salicin extract was used in a lot of studies. Bulk Supplement’s 15% salicin extract and Horbaach’s 4:1 extract also seem to both get consistently good results. Horbaach’s white willow tincture taken sublingually was also said to be even more powerful.",1653349238,i9qtz5t,t3_uug3v5,t1_i9qsikc,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Cappin_The_Turtle,"I define euphoria and mood elevation as slightly different. Whereas mood elevation is normally achieved through altering thinking patterns, correcting neurochemical imbalances, and (obviously) personal events. Euphoria is a short-lived time of an intense sense of pleasure or well-being. Unlike simple mood elevation, euphoria is usually (though not always) achieved through activating certain neurochemical pleasure pathways and/or through unnatural fear extinction. While mood elevation clears the mind, euphoria usually clouds the mind. But you bring a good point on the blurry line between euphoria and better mood. I agree mood elevation is key to a successful nootropic. My key point in claiming that euphoria is anti-nootropic is that euphoria is usually achieved through your brain clouding over certain aspects of reality (like fear, problems, time, etc). Examples of that would be when you’re high or sexually aroused. On the other hand, proper mood elevation can be achieved through optimizing how your brain views and processes reality.",1677787736,janx5x7,t3_uug3v5,t1_jakytjg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Cappin_The_Turtle,">One note, though, is that there is some data to suggest that COX2 inhibition has drawbacks that COX1 doesn't, such as inhibition of injury repair, and heart things. At least, Rhonda Patrick believes so.

That is true. COX inhibitors reduce prostacyclin production. Prostacyclin prevents platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, so its inhibition can worsen heart health. The good news is that the salicin (aspirin precursor) in white willow is a known anti-coagulant and reduces platelet aggregation quite potently. We do know white willow has high amounts of other heart-protective compounds like catechins and procyanidins also.

Interestingly, low-dose aspirin (50mg) was actually found to potentiate exercise-induced prostacyclin production— [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7649919/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7649919/)

I haven't looked into the relationship between COX2 inhibition and injury repair too much, but a quick look does seem to point to impaired recovery: [https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-017-0297-2](https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-017-0297-2)

Although a new study also proclaims that COX-2 inhibition does not alter wound healing: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33049117/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33049117/)

I personally believe white willow may interfere with wound healing because in general strong anti-inflammatories by nature block certain processes in the body that regenerate tissue. On the other hand, blocking inflammation during injury can prevent the breakdown of muscle and spikes in cortisol.",1663787117,ipdaw7g,t3_uug3v5,t1_ip3mqu0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
