HiLiiife,"Man... I just recently started running out of the oxiracetam I bought years ago. Oxiracetam was always my favorite racetam to use for stacking. I came back to the scene and was like, ""wtf happened?"" It's sad to see how every racetam has been phased out... Heck even a few months ago when I peaked, there was still some aniracetam floating around with these vendors... Not anymore! lol Thanks for the explanation though! I felt so in the dark. haha",1682385940,jhlhsd8,t3_v174uv,t3_v174uv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Zdog54,You can get fasoracetam from newmind still. You need an approved account to be able to buy from them but it's honestly not that hard to do. I was able to pass their application by doing some quick Google searches and I completely half assed the entire thing and still got approved,1653947468,ialc24v,t3_v174uv,t1_ial2lwn,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

entropeutic,"im quite sad at the racetam sweep thats happening. i have a bunch of oxi/ani left but thats it. its disgusting how authorities just take shit away from us like that, shit that does wonders for our quality of life in general. why do they like to take away the things we love the most? meanwhile, killers like alcohol and tobacco run rampant, making us dumber and giving us cancer. but some cool interesting compounds that do the opposite of make us dumber with no carcinogenic properties? i guess anything that doesnt keep us dumb and dying is not ok to them... so many things wrong with so many things :(",1685500912,jmaf434,t3_v174uv,t1_jhlhsd8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
