sirsadalot,"You know, the FDA made some wild statements about 5-HT3 antagonists causing risk of serotonin syndrome but these are not based on science. Not surprising.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4883185/#:~:text=Recent%20reports%20have%20suggested%20that,can%20sufficiently%20raise%20serotonin%20levels.

Tropisetron only modestly increases serotonin and it wouldn't make sense how 5-HT3 antagonists would cause SS anyways.

Some advice: disregard everything authority says and have a look at the facts yourself.",1654015190,iaoi56y,t3_v1t2ph,t3_v1t2ph,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Tyler_too_cold,Suicidal crisis. This is very serious. Bromantane does increase serotonin a little. So if you combine it with an SSRI you could feel worse. Maybe try taking bromantane with Cordyceps Militaris so that you feel motivated.,1654015193,iaoi5f6,t3_v1t2ph,t3_v1t2ph,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Okay, I always thought that claim was strange considering isn’t propranolol a 5-HT3 antagonist?? I may be misremembering, but I believe when used alongside ssris, propranolol has a synergistic anxiolytic effect with it. Which always confused me",1654015393,iaoimq2,t3_v1t2ph,t1_iaoi56y,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,Is there any good reference point for what a modest increase in serotonin from Tropisetron is?,1654105295,iat7jko,t3_v1t2ph,t1_iaoi56y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"No, I have had mental illness and depression for the majority of my life and have gone through multiple suicidal crisises in the past. Never noticed anything get triggered after a stack besides Sarcosine, which I had a bad reaction to. Kratom PAWS probably played a role in developing the mindset that led up to it, though. As I had only been off it for around 30-ish days by that point. At the time all I had been taking for the past month was high dose myo-inositol, reacta-c, vitamin d3/k2, magnesium glycinate, microzinc, fish oil, nac, caffeine, bromantane, ALCAR, and once a week phenibut with phenylpiracetam. Also some antimicrobials and other gut-related supps that I don’t think are connected.",1654039791,iaq0yzz,t3_v1t2ph,t1_iaptzgx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,Haven’t tried mixing cordyceps with bromantane yet bc it seemed like it’d be overstimulating but ig it’s worth a shot,1654173589,iawlron,t3_v1t2ph,t1_iaoi5f6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"Well not only that but Vortioxetine is a 5-HT3 antagonist and SSRI and it doesn't have SS issues at all.

It's just depressing how they don't even try to be scientific in their methodologies. They serve to strike down drugs on behalf of opposing pharmacies using BS case studies that mean nothing.",1654015747,iaojh4r,t3_v1t2ph,t1_iaoimq2,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
