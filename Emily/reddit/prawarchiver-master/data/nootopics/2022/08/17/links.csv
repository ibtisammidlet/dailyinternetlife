Is sunifiram as harmful and dangerous as its bad reputation shows? I don't know, it would be an interesting question that someone could answer by looking at its mechanism of action:-CaMKII and PKCalpha activation-Glycine binding site activation of the NMDA receptor

Sunifiram is supposedly an ampakine, but due to its effects and due to its mechanism of action do not seem to be one, nor would I put it under the controversial category of nootropic, for me it is more of a Cognitive Enhancer and surely one of the most effective that exists.

Risk of excitotoxicity? Surely yes, as I currently take memantine 3 mg a day, that was one of the reasons why I dared to experiment with Sunifiram again. It feels very different than IDRA-21 also.

Years ago Sunifiram at doses of 5 - 10 mg sublingual always gave me an enhanced speed of cognitive process, it was like increasing the playback speed by x2 however it was free of chaos and tangles when speaking. Tha was without Memantine. Recently I started to dose it at 2 - 5 mg orally with Memantine 3 mg, Phosphatydylcholine. It was powerful for increasing memory retention, I remember very well what I read that day, however  It reduced the speed of comprehension very much, it was much easier to lose sight of what was being studied, it was a lot of visual immersion in the present...

The interesting thing about Sunifiram is that it has a little explored mechanism of action, 200% acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex, but that only occurs in low doses.

""Sunifiram injections at 0.01mg/kg are able to facilitate acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex of rats, with no apparent efficacy at 1mg/kg.\[4\] The magnitude was around 200% of baseline within an hour of injection.\[4\] ""Therefore, in small doses it releases Acetylcholine but in higher doses it does not have that effect. This is something I have been able to verify in the last experiments, even in doses as low as 0.2 mg, the increase in perception is similar to when you consume nicotine for the first time, it is like being much more immersed in the present in a spatial way, which for reading texts is wonderful. It is like to walk, it is like to navigate in a spatial way what you are seeing, what you are reading, reading books becomes something pleasant.

It is important to clarify that I do not have problems with excess acetylcholine, when I dose sunifiram in such low doses I am also consuming Convolvulus Pluricaulis (Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor) and phosphatidylcholine, however for many it could be too much acetylcholine. I think that at such low doses Sunifiram poses much less risk. Actually as I see it the big problem with Sunifiram is its mechanism of action from CaMKII and PKCalpha. From wikipedia ""**CaMKII** is a serine/threonine specific protein kinase that is regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex. CaMKII is involved in many signaling cascades and is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory.\[1\]  CaMKII is also necessary for Ca2+ homeostasis and reuptake in cardiomyocytes,\[2\]  chloride transport in epithelia,\[3\]  positive T-cell selection,\[4\]  and CD8 T-cell activation""It could interact with a lot systems, so It is easer to feel that you are playing with fire....

And I want say it, I have stacked low doses of it with much things: IDRA-21 for example, the Uridine stack, herbs Garlic and Olive extract (longevity and cardioprotectant), ALCAR, Methylphenidate (ADHD prescribed), low doses PDE5 inhibitor all the same day. (yes PDE5 inhibitors could work as a cognitive enhancer due to increased blood flow to the PFC, it increases neurite outgrowht)

At least, as I said before 3 mg Memantine works very well to prevent excess NMDA firing to me. It is also easily soluble in H20 so it is so easy to make a solution in a amber glass dropper bottle.  
Also it does not loose effects afte 3 days of continous dose at 0.2 mg.  I used it to write an essay in record time over three days.
