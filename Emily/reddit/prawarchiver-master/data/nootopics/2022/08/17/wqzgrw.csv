lovejackdaniels,"Slightly off topic. I suspect I have abnormal level of extra synaptic glutamate but less NMDA receptor activation. How do I fix it? Sublingual sacrosine 1gm makes me active and peppy at times. 

Background - I have all negative symptoms of schizophrenia (especially the negligible emotions and zero motivation) but never positive symptoms since childhood. Recently diagnosed with ADHD inattentive and on Ritalin but it doesn‚Äôt do much. Ritalin only stops dopamine in synaptic space from being absorbed. But what if you have low dopamine firing  to begin with? especially on mesocortial pathway as I live in the moment and have no motivation for medium term and long term tasks which require planning. 

Now low dose marijuana makes me very motivated and I experience emotions I have never experienced in my life. Words have meaning. Idioms have meaning. Movies are lively. I can cry. I feel motivated to conquer the world. All of the things which neurotypicals can do all the time. THC impacts CB1 receptor and acts as indirect agonist for NMDA receptor among other things. 

Can anyone knowledgeable help out here? I live in a third world country and generic Ritalin is the best out there. Docs don‚Äôt give a shit and I have never studied biology after high school. Doing my own research for nearly one year.",1660800273,ikrcrja,t3_wqzgrw,t3_wqzgrw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

vmmm82,"  
My first time i try sunifirma. Start with 2 x 5mg.  No effekt  - Next 2 days i take 2 x 15 mg. Also no effekt.  
Every 2 day i increase. Now i am on dailey dose from 3 x 20mg.  Maybe i feel a litle subtile effect but i am not sure. Audiobook with speed x 3 i can hear without problems.  
NO sideeffekts. I take it sublingual.  
I have read there some people who must take more to have a effect.  
What i must say i am in general a person who have a high tolerance against stimulants ans psychedalics.  
But sunifirma is a new chemical for me. Thats i take care on the first time like with all other chemicals.

Bierak,"You look as a good candidate for low dose aripiprazole 1 - 2 mg. It enhances mesocortical dopamine transmission.
Look at glutamatergics... Low dose racetam like Piracetam, or perhaps Pregnenonole.
Memantine could prevent excess nmda firing, however what do you need is to enhance nmdar receptors. If your speculations are correct, low nmda receptor sensitivity could lead excess extrasynaptic glutamate.",1660841111,iktdlit,t3_wqzgrw,t1_ikrcrja,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

lovejackdaniels,"Thank you for responding. I hope my theory is on the right track.

I just started aripiprazole 2.5mg daily since yesterday. Should I taper it to 1mg? I am planning to do it anyways in 4 days once the dose reaches its half life. 

Quick \[google search\]([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/)) shows Pregneleone enhances NMDA activation but in cerebellum region. Will this be a part of mesocortial pathway? What dose are you talking here?  I have 50mg pills from life extension with me.

Piracetam increases receptor density which absolutely makes sense to try. What doses do you have in mind?

Dont want to try memantine as the purpose is to enhance nmdar.",1660842622,ikthhzh,t3_wqzgrw,t1_iktdlit,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

AllowFreeSpeech,"It was about 10 mg that led to the brain damage. Whether it's 5 or 10 or 20 doesn't matter as much as the extremely serious interactions. It was safe when used in total isolation. It can however interact with a number of other common stimulants to cause irreversible damage. If you had any sense of the hell that I experienced, you would then understand. I had to reluctantly use multiple multi-month-long courses of a benzo + valproate + memantine + telmisartan to get better. I struggled with continuous pressure headaches for years.

The set of stimulants that it interacts with are not well defined. I can tell you the names that applied to me, but it would be an incomplete list, and I don't want it to mislead any reader.",1670023102,iyommh4,t3_wqzgrw,t1_iyogrki,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
