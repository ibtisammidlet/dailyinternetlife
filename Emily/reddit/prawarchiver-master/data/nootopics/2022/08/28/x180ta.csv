You could also cycle bromantane with vyvanse, 3 days on bromantane and 4 days on vyvanse, it helps lower tolerance aswell as extend the duration of effects of vyvanse, I take 30mg dex for my adhd and cycle it like this, it definitely works.",1661906697,imgmt2x,t3_x180ta,t3_x180ta,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
LungsOfSteel,"Just to comment on the blood test results. It is thought that magnesium deficiency won't easily show up on a serum test as it's released from cells in response to stress or even bones.

In chronic magnesium deficiency, serum magnesium levels are often within the normal reference range (*usually* lowest quartile) and may not progress to overt hypomagnesaemia.",1661950063,imik81j,t3_x180ta,t3_x180ta,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I know but what *type* of caffeine though? Because I've tried various different types and have found they do different things; e.g. some like Matcha just extend the mellow focused feeling/duration of my meds, whereas things like coffee and white tea made me too heightened and jittery, whereas things like Yerba Mate gave me the right kind of energy but way too fast and made me very irritable too.  


>Phenylpiracetam is amazing for working out if you can find it.

Cool, thanks for the tip. Is that legal in Australia?",1661833026,imcilct,t3_x180ta,t1_imcgbk1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lana_del_reymysterio,">I wonder, have you tried Agmatine sulfate? I heard that might help. Also ALCAR.

I've tried ALCAR and possibly Agmatine sulfate as part of pre-workouts but never separately. I do have some ALCAR on hand but have been putting off trying it since all the other Cholinergics have just made me tired.  


>Also as a fellow ADHD er, may I ask, how long have you been on Vyvanse? What is the dose? Do you ever take breaks from it?

Been on Vyvanse about 1.5 years now, was on short-acting Dex a for a year before that. Built up to 70mg last year (was on that for 4 months, too high!) then came down to 65mg around January which I've stayed at since. 

I've only taken two singular days off (not in succession) since starting it. 

Reason I don't take days off more often is because I notice that when I do take a day off, then that day is just a complete write-off because I just end up sleeping all day (withdrawal symptoms?). I don't go back to my normal unmedicated self on a day off meds, just a wiped out drowsy state.

Anyway, looking for other options.

&#x200B;

I was on Ritalin first and it led to disastrous results for me, even at small doses.

Amphetamines have been much better for me, might be worth a shot for you? Or maybe a non stimulant med?",1661901551,imgbbux,t3_x180ta,t1_imep0ui,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
lana_del_reymysterio,">You didn't mention if you'd tried moving your workout to first thing in the morning. That might take advantage of natural dopamine and cortisol levels.

You're right, let me elaborate on that.

By the time I finish work at the end of the day, that's when I start to wind down in terms of the positive effects of Vyvanse and so am looking for the right kind of thing to perk me back up again.  
  
This is because when the meds start wearing off, I start becoming depressed, spacey, feel like I have no soul. When this happens I have no motivation to do anything, whether productive or fun. This is also the state I'm often in the following morning before taking my next day's Vyvanse dose (which is why AM workouts would not work).  


>Forskolin might be worth a try for upregulating dopamine and increasing cAMP.

Interesting, I'll look into that.

When would I be looking to take that? As Vyvanse is wearing off?",1661900674,img9cw3,t3_x180ta,t1_imfzqll,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Yes, I was thinking you'd take forskolin an hour before wind down. It works pretty quickly, so, you'd know in a few days if it's going to help.
