So no desire to change that.*

Only problem is, it's killed the ""bodily energy"" I used to have in my body. Best way I can describe it is that I have lost the pent up ""buzz"" in my body in terms of that physical urge to be active and instead feel a kind of zen vibe; like very relaxed and content and still.

* Before meds I would workout after work in the late afternoon, whereas now on meds I find I struggle to find the right kind of energy/motivation to go workout.
* I've tried a few supplements/nootropics (Vitamin B, Tyrosine, Matcha, Preworkouts with some L-Theanine, DHA, COQ10, Creatine) and at best they've just extended the duration of the calm relaxed focused vibe of my medication (which is great but not the kind of boost I need to go workout).
* Cholinergics I've tried (Alpha GPC, Ginkgo, Ginseng, Bacopa) have just made me tired and have been no help at all.

So I'm looking for supplements that will give me a workout specific energy; a physical energy boost that will give me that ""yeah let's go workout and lift heavy things"" kind of vibe rather than a deep focus energy.

But also something that won't jack up my heart rate (e.g. too much caffeine without L-Theanine) as that also stops me being able to workout for being too heightened and jittery (seems to synergise with Vyvanse)

Diet is fine, ample daily protein, recent blood test results were all fine in terms of all major vitamins (especially Mg/Zn), testosterone, TSH, etc.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"ADHD meds work great but make me too zen and kill my drive to workout, any tips for supplements to counteract this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/x180ta/adhd_meds_work_great_but_make_me_too_zen_and_kill/

I was aware that idra-21 and prl-8-53 would be difficult to notice without proper opportunites that would allow its prominence. I mean, if you're not doing much it's difficult to gauge the difference in memory/learning. But my work + study environment is pretty demanding, so I thought my chances of noticing its effects wouldn't be so bad. While stacking, I even thought I had moments where I definitely felt different. Turns out, the effects are even more subtle that I'd imagined.

Just hours ago I remembered that I'd recorded my scores from [humanbenchmark.com](https://humanbenchmark.com) about two months ago, so I decided to  give it another go. I got slightly\~meaningfully improved scores over all areas except typing and reaction time. But the stack's effect of short-tem memory, at least for the sequence memory test is quite hard to believe. I was already in the 20-21 range before, but today I got a 35. I forgot to save my results, so I went ahead and took just the sequence memory game again - 36. And I knew I could just keep going, except I felt enough is enough. I'm not sure if the stack is helpful for other tests, but it surely is for the sequence memory. (Improvements in chimp test and others were there, but I'm not sure whether the differences are large enough to comfortably discredit luck or a 'good brain' day.)

In terms of side effects, I've been constipated, which I knew would come with tropisetron. I've also had some other unpleasant experiences (including short bursts of headaches), but it's difficult to say that the stack played a part in them. I'm just not sure. But it's more reasons to be excited about tak-653, i'll be replacing idra-21 with tak-653 as soon as it comes out.

I'm definitely not trying to promote any of these. If one were to try, I would strongly suggest addding these to your stack one by one. I made the foolish decision to start all of them together, so I don't know which one of these is playing the major part in my improvements/potential side effects. But I wanted to share my experience about the effects, especially since I saw a quantitative improvement that would be difficult to explain without the stack.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tropisetron + IDRA-21 + PRL-8-53,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wzwp5p/tropisetron_idra21_prl853/
