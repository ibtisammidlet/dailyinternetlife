sirsadalot,"Factoring in the wait times and cost, first class shipping has the best value over all. This is true for both domestic and international orders. The only downside is they don't keep people in the loop as much as they should.

In the future I plan to work with DHL for international orders, but they are over an hour away. So definitely a future thing. And FedEx/ UPS just don't seem competitive enough.

I know how this sounds, but you do save time and money by placing larger orders with me. Less spent on shipping and waiting. And past a certain threshold, shipping is free. One 18mL bromantane spray might last up to 3 months, which obviously makes it very cheap and available, but this doesn't apply quite as much to the vast other items I have expanded my inventory to include.

Especially bromantane.co exclusives like Tropisetron and soon TAK-653 (just received the first 5g, so excited & waiting on lab results to come back).",1661848355,imd2nt5,t3_x1bnmn,t3_x1bnmn,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
Consistent-Camp9289,"Yeah, same happened to me as well. 'first-class international' service at USPS is really just the standard shipping service and it's quite notorious for being unreliable with tracking & time spent in delivery.   
I hope u/sirsadalot explores better international shipping options, but many of the better options are often too pricey and I wouldn't be surprised if he's got his plate full already.",1661846878,imd0zbj,t3_x1bnmn,t3_x1bnmn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

annapoh56,"I'm in the UK and ordered from bromantane.co on two occasions, on the first the parcel arrived after 12 days, on the second it took over 6 weeks, I too thought it had been lost or seized by customs, but then to my relief it suddenly arrived.

I agree USPS is not great but the cost is indeed ok, but it would be nice to have additional international shipping options in the future (I'd say keep the USPS option for those who prioritize a lower cost, but also offer other couriers).

How did you manage to contact USPS about your delayed package?

I tried to do that at the time, but remember that once I put the tracking number in, the website displayed a message saying that for that type of package/service they provided no customer service.",1662505661,indn4di,t3_x1bnmn,t3_x1bnmn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Consistent-Camp9289,"Hope by the time TAK-653 becomes available, bromantane recovers from its pre-order status. Is this a possible/probable scenario?   
I want to save the hassle & shipping cost of placing separate orders, but if that means waiting for bromantane to come through, I'll order separately.",1661850743,imd5d86,t3_x1bnmn,t1_imd2nt5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
