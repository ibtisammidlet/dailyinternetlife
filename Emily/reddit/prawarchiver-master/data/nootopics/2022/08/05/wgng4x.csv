sirsadalot,"There is no study on its mechanism, and the main incentive to use it is a positive study in humans where it was well tolerated and enhanced memory acquisition.

I think it might be a D amino acid oxidase inhibitor because it's chemically similar to benzoic acid (think sodium benzoate) and reduces stereotype behavior from reserpine which D-Serine does but that's just a hunch. NMDA glycine site activity would explain the human study.

People have said it's a HDACI but I have no clue what they're basing that on.

Anyways nobody knows how it works, there's just not many positive studies of nootropics in healthy people so it stands out despite the lack of research elsewhere.",1659680139,ij0s5ez,t3_wgng4x,t3_wgng4x,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,To be honest it feels and tastes like a stimulant. In the animal amnesia reversal study amphetamine and pemoline easily beat all other nootropics including prl-8-53,1660951021,il007xe,t3_wgng4x,t3_wgng4x,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Have you trialed it yourself and do you have any comments about it? Is it any better than something like bacopa for memory? I’m looking for something that will increase memory because of the medications I’m taking (ritalin and gabapentin) that mess with my working memory. However, bacopa and NSI-189 seem to diminish the effects of MPH for me which is really inconvienent",1659680298,ij0sdik,t3_wgng4x,t1_ij0s5ez,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
CrystalPiano,I tried looking this up to no avail. Could you link the study?,1690624079,jtx7ddm,t3_wgng4x,t1_il007xe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Bacopa seems antidopaminergic so I can understand why it would dull Ritalin for you. If Gabapentin is hurting your memory my advice is to quit it. Maybe replace with Tropisetron and perhaps Etifoxine with TUDCA.,1659721494,ij2xoqf,t3_wgng4x,t1_ij0sdik,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"I recommend reading my post about Tropisetron. Other than that, Etifoxine is an anxiolytic without addiction that has potential positive effects through neurosteroids. TUDCA for liver protection and regeneration.",1659728063,ij3erab,t3_wgng4x,t1_ij3cxgq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"Be careful, if you quit gabapentin, you should taper. Talk with a medical professional before doing this and proceed with caution. Also, for those with severe anxiety, non-pharmaceutical interventions tend to not be as effective.",1659728848,ij3gsfl,t3_wgng4x,t1_ij3cxgq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
