BoofDontShoot,NAC helps me concentrate and feels like a Caffeine+L-Theaninw mix,1661203198,ildgycf,t3_wv2e9g,t3_wv2e9g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"Congratulations on stopping stimulants. That’s amazing. I’m only not answering you because to be honest, I didn’t understand the question.",1661262030,ilgdmd5,t3_wv2e9g,t3_wv2e9g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Dextrometh_orphan,"Are the effects noticeable for you? I have only tried the other 2 separately, but they are supposed to be very synergistic together",1661373131,iln55zm,t3_wv2e9g,t1_ildgycf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Dextrometh_orphan,"Hahaha I'm sorry, I just wrote this out of the top of my head 2 days ago when I stopped. It's not that difficult if you have someone you trust to hold your things, for at first these 2 weeks at least.

I wanted to know what people's opinions were on these 4 compounds, but I kinda answered it myself.

I'm taking NAC everyday and started 9-me-BC yesterday to see what will happen, it has alleged dopamine-healing properties to put it short. Decided not try the PRE-084 due to it being mostly unknown and possible interaction with 9mebc, but when i try it alone I'll likely write a report",1661373036,iln4wwu,t3_wv2e9g,t1_ilgdmd5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,"Stimulants are bad only if you abuse them. There was a research reversing amnesia in rodents  amphetamine, pemoline and mph topped the chart followed by piracetam. Prl-8-53 was useless.",1661407864,ilp8925,t3_wv2e9g,t1_ilgdmd5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
BoofDontShoot,majority of supplements are not noticeable unless you are deficient in them. NAC just regulates my pain better as does a curcumin piperin mix but is one of the supplements that should be cycled. also some cancer studies done on it and helps me regulate sugar consumption which wasn’t really bad anyways but was noticeably for me. also less meat cravings actually thinking about days on v off,1661376901,ilnf2ww,t3_wv2e9g,t1_iln55zm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,"Thanks. The only recommendation I have is to add things one add a time so you can tell how they affect you. 

Best of luck to you.",1661373304,iln5ma0,t3_wv2e9g,t1_iln4wwu,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Dextrometh_orphan,thank you my friend :) and I have tried NAC before anyway,1661377551,ilngrin,t3_wv2e9g,t1_iln5ma0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
infrareddit-1,Something to look into for the future is ALCAR. It has been shown to upregulate the dopinergic system as well. It has more data than 9-me.,1661379767,ilnmcx1,t3_wv2e9g,t1_ilngrin,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
