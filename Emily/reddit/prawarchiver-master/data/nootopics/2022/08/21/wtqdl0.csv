sirsadalot,"I have put serious consideration into carrying cerebrolysin and one primitive idea is perhaps a cortexin nasal spray, since I know that is a powder and I won't have to worry about it degrading. The fragility of the substance is really what's holding that back but maybe it will be easier with cortexin. I think someone said it's abrasive, so it might be a no on that. And btw the prions stuff and the scary stories about cerebrolysin nasal spray seem bogus, a lot of people I know are using cerebrolysin nasal spray and love it. Plus it just makes sense.

For verbal fluency Piracetam and NSI-189 (as you mentioned) seem to check out. Definitely noticed that with NSI-189, so it's interesting you did as well. Dihexa though is definitely a lower priority though I'll bump it up since many people here seem to like it. Am not really sold on the concept of nonselective neurotrophic factor mimetics.

Memantine I probably won't carry, for a variety of reasons. But an experimental idea is gold nanostructured memantine which is selective to extrasynaptic NMDA. Just wish it had at least 3 studies, lol. But the concept is cool. Would be interesting if there were other extrasynaptic selective NMDA antagonists out there. But it seems unlikely.",1661059288,il5r5y5,t3_wtqdl0,t3_wtqdl0,13,False,t5_4aoxhu

Could you elaborate on how this works? Is it just putting a standard 5ml dose into a spray bottle and using it throughout the day? Would it suffer from significant degradation due to exposure to air?",1661383043,ilnuasz,t3_wtqdl0,t1_il5r5y5,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
