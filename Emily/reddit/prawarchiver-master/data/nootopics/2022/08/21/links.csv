personally i’d really love to see:

dihexa - cycled this a few times with the dsmo solution science.bio had, and it helped immensely with depression and verbal fluency, even moreso than NSI-189!! and the two combined together is probably the best antidepressant i’ve ever taken in my life!!

cerebrolysin - never tried this one, but really want to. have heard incredible things about it, with some ppl even saying it’s the “master nootropic” of sorts just due to its wide array of abilities in relation to cognitive performance and other cognitive-related issues

memantine - i also tried this one from science.bio when it was still around, and again it was amazing for depression/anxiety/addictive behavior once a tolerance to the anticholinergic effects were built. also stacked pretty greatly with bromantane",False,t5_4aoxhu,bromantane.co product suggestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wtqdl0/bromantaneco_product_suggestions/
