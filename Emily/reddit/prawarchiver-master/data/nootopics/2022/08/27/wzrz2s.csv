ozonep2,"Not sure it makes sense for me to bother with modafinil. I noticed it's rather hard to buy now in EU, and got quite expensive.

Used it in my stack in 2018 when it was very easy to order. Definitely weaker than NMC.",1661756686,im88czp,t3_wzrz2s,t1_im45epy,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ozonep2,"It's very debatable topic. I believe everything that improves the way brain works is a nootropic. That includes stimulants (caffeine, amphetamines etc.).

ozonep2,"1. Cyclazodone is harder to get in EU. idk why :-p
2. I never got 10+ hours from NMC. Both NMC and regular cyclazodone 'work' for \~4-5 hours, after that I have to take more caffeine or other stimulants to keep the focus.
3. Cyclazodone feels 'dirtier' to me. More like amphetamine. It reminds me why I quit amphetamines in the first place ))",1661756176,im87qhk,t3_wzrz2s,t1_im7bv25,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

KillerGnomeStarNews,"Well yeah, NMC is stronger than amphetamine.
You're basically taking crackhead stimulant, you should probably go to a crackhead subreddit cause nootropics ain't gonna help you with what you're looking for.

Not to mention the liver toxicity of NMC, I can only imagine it's worse than pemoline.
I mean, it is a derivative of pemoline.
And NMC is worse than Cyclazodone.",1661771630,im8qh4q,t3_wzrz2s,t1_im88czp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
