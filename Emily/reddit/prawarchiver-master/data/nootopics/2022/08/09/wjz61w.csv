The answer isn’t clear cut, because serotonin receptors affect cognition in a dose-dependent and context-dependent manner. Is the person depressed/anxious? Are they dealing with other mental issues? Are they on any other medications? Does the ligand affect pre or post synaptic receptors preferentially? Is the ligand a full agonist or partial agonist? Many factors go into it. And all types of cognition aren’t equal. For example, 5HT2A receptors can increase creativity, increase glutamate release from pyramidal neurons, releases dopamine in key areas of cognition, and can remit depression and anxiety in many cases. However, many models suggest that antagonism can affect cognition positively in a stressed environment. This is just one example, but I hope you can see that it is context/task-dependent. If you’re more specific in your search, you might be able to find more solid answers.",1660094774,ijnsrvw,t3_wjz61w,t3_wjz61w,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"High 5ht2a are correlated to depression and suicide. However psychedelics works mainly via Trkb, mTOR and 5ht2a agonism. So It is best to have a low density of 5ht2a and then trying to hit those receptors with something like aniracetam and so on....  
5ht2c antagonism releases dopamine in the pFC.",1660256248,ijx1lug,t3_wjz61w,t3_wjz61w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"Perhaps the positive effect of chronic microdosing on mood has to do with a 5ht2a loss of sensitivity.  
Number of receptors and sensitivity of receptor are two different things... What it is better? to have a high sensitivity but less quantity of receptors or to have more receptors but with less sensitivity?",1660256417,ijx20jl,t3_wjz61w,t1_ijnsrvw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
xMicro,"Without very specific examples and a pharmacological study, you wouldn’t be able to quantify it. However, they could theoretically have the same net effect: less 5HT2A signaling (due to weaker G-protein coupling—desensitization, or internalization—downregulation). Anecdotally, I’ve mainly seen 5HT2A mentioned with “downregulation” in the literature, and desensitization/decoupling with things like GABA-A pentamers, but there’s likely counter-examples that exist for each.",1660259353,ijx8zrs,t3_wjz61w,t1_ijx20jl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
