sirsadalot,"Reading your post history it seems you've had nightmarish experiences with a multitude of different drugs, perhaps mixing many. Seemingly to cure preexisting issues. I don't understand by what mechanism NSI-189 would permanently ruin you, but I won't ban you for posting about it like Majalisk did.

However I would like to question the validity of the claim and the circumstances by which led up to it. For example, did you mix it with things? Did you get it from a legit source? And how can you be sure this polyneuropathy wasn't already bound to happen to you?

NSI-189, despite being a ""research chemical"" was studied in humans, and thousands of nootropics users have experimented with it. Yet this is my first time hearing of any neurotoxicity.

That's not to say it's not possible, but a lot of people will take this anecdote as fact and it's good to differentiate between something like this and a controlled study where outside factors are accounted for.

As for an actual recommendation, the most I can say is R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (like you have mentioned), ALCAR, NOW DHA-500, prebiotic fiber with a probiotic, Magtein and perhaps a 3 day fast with EGCG every once in a while. As for your anhedonic symptoms, my research leads me to believe chronic ALCAR, bromantane and D-Serine would have the best effects.",1660692370,ikl54k3,t3_wq67tj,t3_wq67tj,11,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"this is off topic, but i’ve seen you post a lot about d-serine. how is it in comparison to agmatine for depression/anhedonia (one in the same for me) can they be taken together? i’ve read the couple little write ups you made on it, but i do not understand the technical stuff that well. liek i can read write ups like this, and understand and process the facts written in it, but have absolutely no idea how to apply that knowledge anywhere else bc my understanding of neuroscience is so elementary and basic, and i’ve found that 1 + 1 often doesn’t = 2 in this subject.

is d-serine like sarcosine? if so, would a stack like d-serine and NACET be a more advanced version of the classic anti-anhedonia stack of sarcosine and NAC? any types of drugs or medications that shouldn’t be mixed with d-serine?",1660716907,ikmh8es,t3_wq67tj,t1_ikl54k3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ChemicalVictim777,"Thank you for your candor regarding my experience. I obtained NSI from Reachgenius, which is actually a well-accepted source. I did not mix it, but I did try Cerebrolysin about a month later, which did not significantly improve my symptoms but also did them not worse. In regards to cancer I didn't feel comfortable boosting so many nerve growth factors, but I was desperate.

In the megathread about NSI of the Longecity forum, you can find from page 185 a user named ""Swisscurrie"" who had similar negative experiences. He also claimed to be in contact with 15 other people who have been negatively changed or even ruined by NSI. Unfortunately, no more detailed information were mentioned and I don't know how it ended with Swisscurrie. He was no longer online since august 2017, also in another forum in which he thought about suicide, so it might have ended badly for him.

Thanks, I'll take a look at your recommended supllements and think about them.",1660819849,iks2ba9,t3_wq67tj,t1_ikl54k3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"NAC I feel like leans more in the direction of anhedonia. D-Serine and Sarcosine are similar in some ways, different in others. I value D-Serine more due to the selective importance of it as a neurotransmitter and the negatives of increasing glycine, like with Sarcosine.

Agmatine sulfate cured my depression, but it was not caused by anhedonia, rather it was a constant bad feeling and downward spiraling thoughts and it cleared up my head and stopped the thought loops. D-Serine probably better suited for anhedonia.",1660790186,ikquebe,t3_wq67tj,t1_ikmh8es,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,what about combining agmatine and d-serine together for both depression and anhedonia? and potentially preventing any excitotoxicity from increasing glutamate? also would taking magnesium glycinate alongside d-serine enhance its desired effects or make it more dangerous? sorry if i’m misunderstanding these compounds,1660883066,ikw5p66,t3_wq67tj,t1_ikquebe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
