I was smoking cannabis daily for an extended period of time recently but obviously needed to quit.

So 1 day before I stopped using, I switched to keto. The withdrawal phase which usually lasts 5-7 days for me which included feelings of huge despair, cravings, anxiety, sweatyness but especially a major rush of ""knockout depression"" the entire day etc.

But when I m on keto I wont get that ""knockout depression"" anymore which really was the painful part of the whole process.

So dont get me wrong...I still felt shitty with cravings, anxiety, sweatyness u name it but overall my suffering decreased by a whopping 70% just because that knockout depression was eliminated which really made the difference for me.

Currently its n=1 so I dont know if it is universally applicable for all drugs & people.

Please try it out and report in the comments, thanks.  :)",False,t5_4aoxhu,Cut suffering by 70% while in drug withdrawal phase.,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wqykz0/cut_suffering_by_70_while_in_drug_withdrawal_phase/

Seeking a genuine suggestion for an effective Nootropic supplement with almost nil side effects and safe for long term usage. Basically I have a very sensitive and overtly active Sympathetic nervous system. Which means my heart rate and blood pressure shoots up even in mild altercations, normal provocative debate or even when getting Blood Pressure taken for medical checkup. Which otherwise is perfectly fine, that heart rate goes berserk even though I'm not feeling much anxious and relatively calm. Docs scold me for being a kid and afraid of simple blood pressure. But only I know what I go through. It's like a switch turned on automatically as soon as I enter the clinic or if having an argument with someone. So please tell what are the most effective and safe Noots for calming SNS, adapting to stress and staying calm in these situations. 

TLDR -; 22 Y/O guy. Anxiety and over sensitive sympathetic nervous system. Even with minimal anxiety heart rate shoots up along with B.P. in even mild altercations or while in doctors office. Please suggest some nootropics that are most effective and safe for incorporating in long term.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Effective Nootropics suggestion for Overtly sensitive SNS,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wqp0j1/effective_nootropics_suggestion_for_overtly/

I'm  still suffering from periphere neuropathy (numb parts all over my  body) over a year and a half since my last NSI dose. I have also read  this from others but the data situation is very poor in this respect.  After waiting brought nothing I am currently trying a few supplements:

\- Vitamin B complex (B12 as injection)

\- Magnesium citrate

\- R-lipoic acid

\- Algae oil for Omega 3

It's  a little better now but everything is going very slowly. Has anyone  experienced this as well and did it go away? What else might help?  I'm worried that I have permanent nerve damage from NSI neurotoxicity.",False,t5_4aoxhu,NSI-189 and periphere neuropathy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wq67tj/nsi189_and_periphere_neuropathy/
