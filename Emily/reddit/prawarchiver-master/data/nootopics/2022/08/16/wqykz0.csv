,"I experienced a similar effect while active on keto

I think it's the ketones. Keto also reduces seizure risk so your body will be calmer while rebounding off the cannabis sedation.

Personally I've found a couple of things help me immensely if I've gone long enough to experience withdrawals. 1. Exercise, but not to the point of exhaustion. Just normal movement. Helps immensely. 
2. Tylenol. I've often found Tylenol not only relieves any rebound aches and pains it also helps to calm my nerves. I'm not sure why. Maybe something to do with this? https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167401/
