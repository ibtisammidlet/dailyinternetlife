DopeAppleBroheim,"If you want clearheaded THC every time, I’d highly recommend HHC. It’s a cannabinoid similar to THC, but far more clear headed and no anxiety/paranoia. Plus it’s legal in most states under the farm bill.",1660158972,ijramni,t3_wl30ms,t3_wl30ms,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"none at all!! in fact, i feel less nausea from my IBS while on tropisetron, which is in line with its selective 5-HT3 agonism (the same MOA as ginger)",1660171123,ijs6g50,t3_wl30ms,t1_ijr7ieg,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DopeAppleBroheim,"It could, but it will be weaker for sure. I would take a tolerance break and then try HHC. I prefer HHC over regular weed these days. It’s usually like $15-$25 for a HHC vape cart too, so pretty cheap",1660171512,ijs7elg,t3_wl30ms,t1_ijs6bfr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DopeAppleBroheim,"I’m not very good at explaining feelings and effects. But HHC basically very similar to delta 9 thc, but way more clear headed. I think it’s stronger compared to delta 8, but I haven’t done delta 8 in like 2 years so can’t quite remember.",1660171121,ijs6fz2,t3_wl30ms,t1_ijrntxk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Consistent-Camp9289,"not sure if it's tropisetron, but i've been noticing that issue and it happens to be sync with when I began using tropisetron  
very mild though, unproblematic unless maybe for someone who's had issues beforehand  


besides that I was worried and surprised to find some people writing about nausea issues, which didn't make sense to me (but I guess there's so much I can understand about tropisetron)
