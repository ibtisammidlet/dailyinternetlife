odder_sea,"Methionine intake is going to activate genetic pathways associated with accelerated aging.

High dose selenium (200mcg of Se-msc, or Sodium serenade, or glycinate) may offset this somewhat.

But generally minimizing methionine intake, and maximizing recycling (as appears to be your intention here) will be better long-term, I'll repeat my reccomendation foe creatine and TMG for this.

Definitely get your MTHFR and COMT genes checked. Insuring optimal forms and dosages of Folate, B6, and B12 are indeed more critical than optimizing methyl donors.",1659471497,iioufyy,t3_we7jag,t1_iiorjku,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

You can also dabble with SAMe, but I don't generally reccomend , not worth the cost or side effects.

Soalian,"It's Carl Hung from the Discord server;

I'm on high-glycine, very low methionine diet, and I also take supplemental glycine on the side (glycine powder, and hydrolyzed collagen powder),  so I l may even suffer from methionine deficiency overall,

because the high glycine intake might lead to methionine depletion overall in the body; methionine still being important in small amounts (liver; kidney health, etc,...),

do you think I should supplementa with TMG, L- methionine or SAM-e ?   I already take creatine.

If your goal is alleviating depression, methylfolate and Acetyl-L-carnitine have synergistic effect in this regard, I'd reccomend at least 500mg/day. The nutricost capsules/powder are a good value, as are iherb's California gold.",1659514673,iir9mar,t3_we7jag,t1_iir8whs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"It is a complex topic, but I tend to think that having more methyl groups for example by consuming betaine from beetroot, organic folate from bran and so son, helps to maintain health.   
Problem with Methionine: is a highly anabolic aminoacid when taken with Leucine for example. Thats why vegan protein is better for increasing healthspan and slowing aging, it has less methione compared to meat for example. Pushing to hard the anabolic machinery increases 1) DNA replication errors 2) Reduces catabolic process when body cleans itself   
Thats why is better to increase methyl groups from other ways, for example by reducing the body needs for producing creatine and phosphatidylcholine, body consumes a lot of methyl groups for making these, thats why you save methyl groups when you get these externally.",1659640063,iiycsyx,t3_we7jag,t1_iir316i,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
