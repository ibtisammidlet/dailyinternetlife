,"Either you're a non-responder, or you're not absorbing it well, eg. it's running down the back of your throat. My guess would be the latter.

My experience with the nasal spray is that unless I use it and immediately sit with my head level, and keep it that way for 20-30 minutes, it all runs down the back of my throat or out the front of my nose. And if I do sit for that long, I feel noticeable effects, whereas if it runs out, I typically can't notice any effects.

As much as the caprylic acid may help absorption, I think it's a terrible medium for a nasal spray.",1659623752,iix5u43,t3_wg1ibl,t3_wg1ibl,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Current-Helicopter-5,Got it. Definitely have noticed it running out my nose? Any suggestions besides just sniffing more? Other vendors for non-nasal administration?,1659623861,iix63v3,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iix5u43,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"There is no better medium to my knowledge. I agree that it would be ideal if water, but it's kind of like wanting to have your cake and eat it too.

With any other solvent, Bromantane will either not dissolve, or it will and the mixture will become too viscous to spray, breaking the spray pump.

So unfortunately, unless something crazy happens (i.e. stabilizing it in bipolar tetraether lipids), this is the only practical way to utilize the upregulatory effects of Bromantane as seen in studies.",1659657949,iizl1tq,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iix5u43,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Sniffing doesn't help because of how heavy it is. It just sends it right out the back of your sinuses. My only suggestion is to use it when you can be 100% sure that you can keep your head level for 20-30mins.

I don't know about other Bromantane vendors these days. I haven't really cared to look as I'm pretty sold on it only being worth using nasally, or at least, not orally/sublingually. Catch 22.",1659625385,iix9yzj,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iix63v3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Sterile water. Caprylic acid is an oil, it's very heavy, and because of that, it does not sit in the sinuses long enough to be efficacious IMO, nor does it absorb fast enough to make the weight irrelevant.",1659625471,iixa6vj,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iix7juj,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"You could inject it, but that wouldn't be worth it in my opinion. Snorting powder is not ideal for nasal membranes and may be damaging. Plus caprylic acid improves dispersion/ distribution of molecules and therefore absorption.",1659663847,iizya1w,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iizud9j,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,I have literally told you twice. Use it with your head level and keep your head that way for 20-30 minutes. Don't try and sniff in or out to spread it to your sinuses unless you do so with the absolute lightest amount of effort possible. Anything more than that will send it out your nostrils or down your throat.,1659662057,iizu8k2,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iixejoe,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SimilarCrew2291,"Just try spraying it at different angles in your dose. Your goal is to not hit any tissue that would be visible in a mirror, and have the spray directly hit the olfactory region. The further back the spray is able to make it before it hits tissue, the more diffuse it'll be, and the more surface area you'll hit with it. Also, the olfactory tissue has the most direct connection with the brain.

Back when I was doing intranasal insulin, I found the most effective way was to lie upside down on a bed or couch, with my head hanging off the side. Give 'er a spray, then kinda twirl your head in all directions a bit to fully coat the tissue at the top of your nasal cavity.  Then you can either continue lying with your head upside down for a few minutes (more than a few minutes for bromantane bc of the rather long absorption time), or tilt your head back upright and try to catch any falling liquid in the bottom of your nasal cavity (which can also absorb the drug, albeit less than the olfactory region can) without it running down your nose or throat. This is kinda tricky, and your ability to do it depends somewhat on your own physiology. 

Look up a side diagram of your nasal passage to get an idea of what's going on here.",1659744820,ij4ie5g,t3_wg1ibl,t1_iixejoe,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Wouldn't be worth it, how?

Ah, while we're on it! Have you heard of chitosan oligosaccharide? It's being used to improve drug absorption in pharmaceutical trials and apparently increases morphine bioavailability (I gues oral?) by 6x. There are also anecdotal reports of it increasing Ketamine bioavailability. It could be an option for less bioavailable compounds for you.
