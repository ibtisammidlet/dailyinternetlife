So first time around I didn't feel much waiting for hours for \*something\* to happen, I also assumed I had some tolerance as I've been using sublingual bromantane powder for little less than a month. Then today I sprayed maybe 5-6 times (might have been more) in each nostrils at different angles... and holy shit I'm wired af! Cleaned my apartment thoroughly (probably safe to perform surgery here now), washed my car, did a 10k run at 38C, had a cold shower, replied to +50 emails I had for Monday and now I'm just sitting in front of my computer filled with motivation and energy to do just about anything but got nothing left to do as it's Sunday and I can't wait for Monday, like WTF i've always had Monday anxiety. I feel very manic but in a good way. Sooo anyway, what is the recommended amount and way to apply the bromantane spray without appearing like I am on meth, I can't show up for work like this tomorrow? And will I ""crash"" eventually because I do not think I'll be able to sleep being \*this\* wired?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Think I am using way too much of the bromantane spray, any advise how to apply it best?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/wobuce/think_i_am_using_way_too_much_of_the_bromantane/
