thedreamingmoon12,Try spraying then gently sniffing. It takes a little practice,1660507893,ikamigv,t3_wobuce,t3_wobuce,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Birdy1979,"Ask u/sirsadalot please . Did you buy from Bromantane dot com ?  I recall each spray, which is one dose,  is 9 mg of Bromantane, but as bioavailability is claimed to 5 times greater , then it’s the same as a c. 50 mg oral dose. Please correct me if I’m wrong. 

Does that mean , by spraying 5-6 times in each nostril, you took 10 times normal dose ? 

Let us know how it went .",1660549304,ikcu6dz,t3_wobuce,t3_wobuce,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,Bromantane does not build tolerance nor does it have any withdrawal. I'm not sure what the point of this post is lol. Have you tried taking less? That seems to be what you're going after. You could also try skipping coffee and seeing if that helps. P.s. I wish I got even half the results you got from bromantane,1660507255,ikakzad,t3_wobuce,t3_wobuce,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

EYEi,"Unfortunately I and a few other I know online have tried it and had diminishing returns in terms of subjective effects, but we seem to be the minority if you trust online testimonies. Amazing few days. I am not Dr but it seems like a no brainer that a substance that increases, if indirectly, dopamine signaling will eventually cause some sort of down regulation.",1660522196,ikbj1qb,t3_wobuce,t1_ikakzad,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
