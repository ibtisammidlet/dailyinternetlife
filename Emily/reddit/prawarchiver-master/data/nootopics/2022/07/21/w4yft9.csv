familyfeedaye,"To me you should get bromantane or fasoracetam (for gaba-b up regulation)  but naturally you try exercise mainly cardio and practise mindfulness, but also try wein off don‚Äôt go cold turkey even if it‚Äôs opiates it‚Äôs always good too let your body do what it has to do naturally",1658502380,ih74kzx,t3_w4yft9,t3_w4yft9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
dso333777,You can actually order it online since it's non toxic for the heart and non psychedelic. I'm starting tomorrow as I took the last of my kratom 2day. Wish me luck! (It's cost me $140 for 500mg in case anyone was curious).,1663896177,ipjnzxo,t3_w4yft9,t3_w4yft9,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

dso333777,I actually have some TBG if anyone is interested. I personally wasn't a fan but everyone's body is different. It just made me feel relaxed. I paid 140 plus tax. If anyone wants it I'll let it go for 100. There's 490mg left. Peace love and blessings to yall!,1667949957,ivm3scq,t3_w4yft9,t3_w4yft9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

National_Day_9564,Cerebrolysin won't add more potency to the stack so IMO shouldn't be onda the stack... by the way I will use bromantane even tho is hard to get üòÅ,1658512709,ih7vfv2,t3_w4yft9,t3_w4yft9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

FreshFrozenLux,I like bromantane it just doesn‚Äôt do anything for the withdrawal from kratom. I‚Äôll try the nasal form soon.,1658551660,ihab0ta,t3_w4yft9,t1_ih74kzx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
FreshFrozenLux,"It didn‚Äôt help much for me. Atleast not for the physical symptoms. It did take away cravings and alleviate some mental symptoms.

FreshFrozenLux,"Already using bromantane and it‚Äôs slightly helpful, nothing like when I‚Äôm not in withdrawals though cause it doesn‚Äôt do too much for that.

A ton of people on Reddit have said Cerebrolysin actually attenuates opiate withdrawals. Like to the extent of Ibogaine. Ibogaine has a downstream affect on NGF at the opioid site and cerebrolysin contains NGF.",1658551582,ihaaw5c,t3_w4yft9,t1_ih7vfv2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

National_Day_9564,Cerebrolysin is going to have a slightly helpful effect on opiate withdrawls or at least I did for me on a journey quitting tramadol thats why I think is better to kill the anxiety with high doses odio bromantane. BTW thanks for explaining to me your point üòÅ learned alot.,1658563909,ihase0g,t3_w4yft9,t1_ihaaw5c,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
