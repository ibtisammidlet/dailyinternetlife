Does anyone have any experience with TBG? I am planning on dosing in the morning when w/d starts and on day one 50-100mg, day 2 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, 10mg on Day 6. 

Anyone attempted this? I am interested and hopeful TBG has the same opioid receptor repairing aspect as ibogaine. The studies and talking to sirsadsalot It is a 5-ht2a agonist and although it does cause neurogenesis & decrease addictive behavior. I also read it is more similarly related to 5-meo-dmt than ibogaine. I will report back.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Tabernanthalog,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w4yft9/tabernanthalog/

About 30 minutes later all the sudden i’m hit with what i can only describe as the feeling of coming up on psychedelics just minus the anxiety. Colours appear richer, music/sounds extremely enhanced, stimulated and motivated like never before (i trust that my source didn’t send me mislabel psychs though). Most people report little to no effects for weeks so i was quite taken aback by this, i wasn’t expecting any effects at all. Has anyone else had a similar response to this? Maybe i just have low dopamine and am very responsive to this substance?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Intense reaction to first bromantane dose,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w4laq6/intense_reaction_to_first_bromantane_dose/
