death_poison101,"Not all research chemicals are nootropics. Most, but not all, nootropics are research chemicals.

For example, a research chemical that is not a nootropic could be something like Bromo-DragonFLY, which is a long-acting chemical resembling LSD in effects.

Synthetic cannabinoids (such as those used in the not-so-popular-anymore K2/spice/synthetic weed) are also another example of research chemicals.",1660199882,ijtrrlm,t3_w4laq6,t1_ijtpw1b,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
