I have abnormal had anxiety(and anhedonia) for most of my life which has made me interested in nootropics/pharmacology/neuroscience but still learning the basics..

Is there any one here that knows, which glutamate receptor that is involved in anxiety? All of them?

Also i have taken benzos a little too much the past 1-2 months, I’m thinking of trying either:

1. Block NMDA
2. Block kainate
3. Block AMPA
(Antagonists, NAMs or some other way I don’t know yet)

So which do you think, inhibited, will ease anxiety most?

And also which would ease benzo WD most?

Thanks for reading wish u the best!:)",False,t5_4aoxhu,Antagonizing Glutamate Receptor(which one)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w59vis/antagonizing_glutamate_receptorwhich_one/
