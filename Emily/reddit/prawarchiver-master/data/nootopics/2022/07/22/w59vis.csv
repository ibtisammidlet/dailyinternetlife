Fizziox,"Look for valerian root ticture, you can even made a tea from dried valerian root, it will help alleviate benzo WD and it will decrease the anxiety.   
If you did cold turkey it will be a big difference.

If you are tapering it might make no difference. 

Do not use it for prolonged periods of time.

It is not a medical advice.",1658581619,ihbgzny,t3_w59vis,t3_w59vis,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
SimilarCrew2291,"I think you'd be best off blocking NMDA. There's a metric known as NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio. Admittedly, I don't understand this particularly well, but it basically measures the degree to which NMDA and AMPA receptors respectively contribute to excitatory post synaptic potentials. I believe it's thought that chronic stress raises this ratio (i.e. increases NMDA and lowers AMPA signaling), although I'm not certain that this is done by modulation of the actual number of receptors of each. 

As a practical matter, NMDA antagonists are much easier to come across. Also, both NMDA antagonists and AMPA PAMs have shown antidepressant-like effects. In the case of NMDA, it may be that blocking it induces a compensatory mechanism which raises AMPA signaling, thereby increasing BDNF, which is thought to alleviate depressive disorders.

YMMV but I think a sensible plan would be to trial and NMDA antagonist, then switch to an AMPA antagonist if this provides no benefit. I don't know enough about the kainate receptor to say anything useful about that. Let me know if you want sources for any of this stuff and I'll try to dig them up later. Good luck fren!",1659459584,iinywu9,t3_w59vis,t3_w59vis,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

 Ive come to the conclusion that I have glutamate excitatory issues, phenibut worked wonders for me although it isn't something you can use everyday. I've been looking into gabapentin / pregabalin as it seems to have potential for these issues",1661165682,ilb0uzb,t3_w59vis,t3_w59vis,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Turbulent_Zone_5324,"Coincidentally, I stumbled upon a compound named [GYKI 52466](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GYKI_52466) yesterday. It’s an atypical, non-NMDAR-antagonistic benzodiazepine that highly antagonizes AMPA/kainate receptors selectively. 

It seems to fit your criteria very well (besides the memantine for the NMDAR antagonism already mentioned), but sadly, its optimal dosage protocol (together with administration and bioavailability) isn’t known, as a lack of human research makes it hard to make conclusions. Even though it’s labeled as a benzo, [it barely binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Lack-of-binding-affinity-of-2-3-benzodiazepines-to-GABA-A-GABA-B-receptors-and-BDZ_tbl2_5489446), so it MAY help with GABA withdrawal. Also, it’s expensive as shit.

[This](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18363046/) is the (rodent) study that got my attention in the first place.

MadScientistRat,"What other modalities are there for long-term GABA-A mediated disturbances?

After a decade on Etizolam I feel as if I've fried my receptors beyond point of homeostatic rebalancing, which will culminate in my suicide no earlier than August but no later than September 2024.

I've heard of GABA-A partial allosteric modulators such as Imidazenil and a few others, but custom synthesis would be prohibitive, also in view of lack of literature.",1677024738,j9hfeoa,t3_w59vis,t1_iha807l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Greedy-Artichoke-416,"No, but memantine did wonders for me when I was tapering phenibut, it made me \*normal\*. The glutamate surges were unbearable when I tried to quit cold turkey, tapering with agmatine was okayish but the anhedonia was killing me. Once I started taking memantine 5mg for the first week then 10mg next I actually felt normal again even motivated. The first week taking memantine was rough with brain fog but it cleared up the next. It is not a competitive NMDA antagonist, it only blocks the excess glutamate released caused by disbalance.",1658496878,ih6r54f,t3_w59vis,t1_ih6nr9d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
MezDez,"How much etizolam were you using? Lol

Yes, so these case studies are on people being dependant on opioids or Xanax for decades +.

Lamotrigine is also a good one for other uses like GABA current stability. But topiramate would be the primary one..

They are not dangerous to combine per say, you just need to lower the doses in accordance.
