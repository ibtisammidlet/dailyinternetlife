Tyler_too_cold,Thanks for letting me know. I have both NSI-189 and bromantane. I was never going to combine the two but now Iâ€™m never going to consider it. Best to run a cycle of them separately. NSI 189 at a low dose for 2 weeks then bromantane for two weeks. Bromantane For restoring tyrosine hydroxylase and NSI-189 for emotional enhancement and empathy. Or maybe you were just tripping.,1658292661,igvn0uc,t3_w3d8db,t3_w3d8db,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

IveGotAHumongousDick,"Dude I do that all the time.  Learn your chemistry.  They donâ€™t interact.

Bromantane upregulates the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme which converts L-tyrosine into L-dopa, which then gets converted by another enzyme into dopamine.

,Yeah I cycled Bromantane for a few months and stopped a couple weeks ago. On NSI-189 now for 30 days and then will probably cycle Bromantane again. Iâ€™m also taking agmatine and lions mane which seem to synergies nicely with NSIâ€™s antidepressant effect,1658295434,igvrf6j,t3_w3d8db,t1_igvn0uc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
