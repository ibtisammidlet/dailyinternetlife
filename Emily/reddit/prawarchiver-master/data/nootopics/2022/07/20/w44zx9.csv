sirsadalot,"1 Bromantane modulates circadian rhythms, which seems to be a benefit if taken early.

2, 3. & 4. Supplementing L-Tyrosine is not necessary so long as you eat protein.

7 This question is confusing. Bromantane inhibits FOS, it's an HDACI.

8 Bromantane does create more enkephalin logically but it's also neurogenic (BDNF, GDNF, etc.), reduces oxidative stress, inflammation and more. Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition doesn't stop the synaptogenesis of D1, it just makes it so that D2 is also functioning and experiencing outgrowth.

9 The sensitizing effect of bromantane is synaptogenic and prolonged by GDNF. Selegiline is a MAOI, and its downstream effects on tyrosine hydroxylase aren't through the same mechanisms.

10 BDNF does not impair memory, I'm not sure why you think this. Bromantane doesn't cause excessive BDNF in the wrong regions of the brain or anything weird.",1658380069,ih0hdwb,t3_w44zx9,t3_w44zx9,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

1. If Bromantane stays in system the following day , is it therefore unnecessary to take it everyday, especially given it‚Äôs expensive and now quite difficult to get hold of ? . Can a one day on (2x 50mg), one day off, suffice? 

2. Like most, it‚Äôs near impossible to hold anything in mouth for 30 minutes. If it gets swallowed after 5 minutes, how much less effective is it ?",1658386757,ih0r0be,t3_w44zx9,t3_w44zx9,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bromantasaurus,"7\. My understanding is that bromantane can increase CREB (source: in [this post](https://old.reddit.com/user/sirsadalot/comments/t4rava/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/) you write ""Bromantane's stimulatory effect is caused by increased dopamine synthesis, which it achieves through elevating CREB.""), and increasing CREB can increase delta FosB (source: in the [same post](https://old.reddit.com/user/sirsadalot/comments/t4rava/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/) you have the arrows ""‚ÜëCREB ‚Üí (‚ÜëŒîFosB ‚Üí ‚ÜëHDAC1 ‚Üí ‚ÜìC-Fos ‚Üí receptor desensitization)""). So it seems like bromantane can increase delta FosB. How does it inhibit delta FosB?

10\. I believe I heard from the Nootopics discord from one of the users that BDNF, specifically in the context of Lion's mane, could impair working memory at least in the short term.",1666414645,itaq7sf,t3_w44zx9,t1_ih0hdwb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
