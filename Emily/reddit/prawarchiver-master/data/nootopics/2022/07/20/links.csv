Please provide a citation or reasoning (there is a lot of conflicting information online and so not having citations or reasoning makes it harder for me to process evidence).

1. I have seen a bunch of people recommending dosing in the morning. Why is morning the best time to dose bromantane? Is it because bromantane can cause insomnia if taken too late in the day, or is there some other reason?

2. Is l-tyrosine dosed orally?

3. How much l-tyrosine should be taken for a given amount of bromantane?

4. When should l-tyrosine be dosed relative to bromantane? Should I take l-tyrosine right before I dose the bromantane, or afterwards with some delay? Why?

5. I have bromantane solution, not the nasal spray. How do I keep the bromantane under my tongue for 10-30 minutes without it mixing with my saliva and going down my throat or getting diluted?

6. Should bromantane be taken on an empty stomach or after food, or does it not matter, and why?

7. It is mentioned in other posts that ""aberrant neurogenesis"" is a more frequent side-effect of other classes of dopamine modulating drugs, such as adderall, because of their preferential effect on D1 receptors via DMSNs. Further it's said that bromantane can increase CREB.  Why is the pathway of CREB leading to increased tyrosine hydroxylase the preferential path taken by bromantane utilization, rather than the one involving delta Fos? 

8. How is the effect of ""stabilizing ISMN D2 receptors"", via bromantane, not counteracted by the excess enkephalin release from stimulating D2 receptors with dopamine? As in, how do you compare the relative effects of bromantane on all three of 1) D2 receptor internalization in the presence of high dopamine, 2) ISMN stabilization of D2 receptors and 3) enkephalin release from D2 receptor binding of dopamine? Is there a mechanistic or mathematical model for this?

9. Why does a tolerance build up for increasing tyrosine hyroxylase by selegiline, that doesn't occur when bromantane also increases tyrosine hydroxylase?

10. Why wouldn't increase BDNF via bromantane's mechanism lead to working memory impairment in the short term, much like excess BDNF from Lion's mane has been reported to do?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Some questions about bromantane,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w44zx9/some_questions_about_bromantane/
