I’m aware both MD’s are neurotoxic and can damage the amygdala where NSI causes growth, but is there any actual contraindication between the two that would be of concern? Mainly wondering if NSI inhibits or alters any monoamines that may cause serotonin syndrome or dull the effect of MD, similarly to SSRIs.

The idea behind this combo is enhancing the therapeutic effect of MDMA therapy by strengthening the connections of healing revelations during a session. I’m aware more well-studied compounds exist like cerebrolysin and lions mane, but I was already going to start cycling NSI soon and was thinking of doing and solo MDMA therapy session during the middle of the cycle. Couldn’t find any anecdotes online.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Taking NSI-189 with MDMA/MDA?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w2fe4f/taking_nsi189_with_mdmamda/
