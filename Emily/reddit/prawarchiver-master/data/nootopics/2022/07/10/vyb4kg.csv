sirsadalot2,"Hey, I want to inform you about all the new products added to [bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co):

**Racetam series:** [Fasoracetam](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/buy-fasoracetam/) and [Coluracetam](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/prl-8-53-solution-10mg-ml/) have been added. Piracetam and Pramiracetam will also be added in a couple of weeks. Of course, good prices and third party testing, as always.

**Solutions, for easy measurement:** [PRL-8-53 solutions](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/prl-8-53-solution-10mg-ml-2/), [NSI-189 solutions](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/nsi-189-solution-40mg-ml/), [J-147 solutions](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/j-147-solution-45mg-ml/), [IDRA-21 solutions](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/idra-21-solution-45mg-ml/), and [MK-677 solutions](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/buy-mk-677/) have all been added. Graded dropper, just like with [Tropisetron](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/buy-tropisetron/).

**Other news:** [N-Acetyl-Cysteine Ethyl Ester](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/buy-nacet/) and [Citicoline](https://bromantane.co/index.php/product/buy-citicoline/) have also been added. TUDCA will be added in a couple weeks. I also ordered a ProStar HPLC machine, and am excited about that.",1657739678,ig12p3m,t3_vyb4kg,t3_vyb4kg,1,True,t5_4aoxhu

infrareddit-1,"Thanks for this post. I know how much work it is to create a post like this. Very exciting at this early stage. I've yet to go through all the articles. 

One question that comes to mind is, would you expect piracetam to have a synergistic effect on TAK-653? And further, would you expect NMDA antagonists (memantine, agmatine) to block effects of TAK-653?

Fizziox,"Calcium channels are also mentioned in the mechanism of action of Gabapentinoids (pregabalin, gabapentin). One of the side effects are memory problems.

SLYMON_BEATS,I wish you would have gone into more detail about Pesampator. Maybe why you are a fan or not. It sounds great to me as it functions as an AMPA PAM and a glycine reuptake inhibitor potentially enhancing NMDA receptors.

sirsadalot,"I don't think Piracetam would synergize with TAK-653 unless you were trying to lower the dose of one or the other. Both are AMPA PAMs. TAK-653 aims to do what Piracetam does but far better. Aside from the cholinergic effects, which I think Tropisetron + TAK-653 would replace, not because Tropisetron increases acetylcholine, but because Tropisetron is a partial agonist of a7 nicotinic receptors which are known to meaningfully increase cognition in healthy people as well as be some of the most important overall in terms of benefits.

TAK-653 will potentiate the good effects of NMDA antagonists as well as prevent cognitive dysfunction to an extent.

I think TAK-653 + Tropisetron + Neboglamine and then maybe Magtein will be the best attempt to increase IQ in a healthy individual. Neboglamine I'm still in the process of making possible, but it grows more and more realistic by the day.",1657827283,ig62xog,t3_vyb4kg,t1_ig61igg,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"I think that is too much extrapolation perhaps, for them to be opposites, gabapentin would need to be an AMPA NAM or visa versa.

sirsadalot,"Basically ketamine releases glutamate which binds to AMPA in the hippocampus and causes an antidepressant effect, AMPA PAMs seem to mimick this in some studies.

It's a relatively new substance and it's not even listed on Wikipedia. I'm sure if the CX class compounds were cheaper to synthesize the market would be flooded with them. That's because those Respire guys did a ton of marketing. Takeda didn't at all. I only stumbled across the compound after my friend showed me it.
