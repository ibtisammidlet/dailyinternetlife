I’ve known about NACET’s existence for a while, but I’ve never tried it bc the few mentions I saw of it online basically just said it’s a smellier version of NAC that’s slightly more potent. Is there any reason to use NACET over plain ol’ NAC? I usually take 1 gram of NAC 2x per day to help with inflammation and reduction of anxiety/OCD. I also take molybdenum, selenium, zinc, iron, and liquid chlorphyll (high in copper) alongside it as I know NAC is a heavy metal chelator, which may cause deficiencies long term (or so I’ve read) and considering I’m running on a diet of mostly frozen meals and ramen due to poverty, I’m most definitely deficient in a lot of vitamins/minerals. I also take B12, methyl folate, high dose myo-inositol, vitamin c, e, d3/k2, and magnesium.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why should I take NACET over NAC?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/vr4iup/why_should_i_take_nacet_over_nac/
