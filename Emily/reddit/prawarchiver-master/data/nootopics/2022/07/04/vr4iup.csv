True_Garen,"Both of these studies make a very strange claim. They both claim, contradicting all work that does not include NACET, that NAC does not increase glutathione.

Am I misreading it?

*This is due to a unique feature of NACET: it rapidly enters the cells where it is trapped being transformed into NAC and cysteine. After oral treatment, NACET (but not NAC) was able to increase significantly the glutathione content of most tissues examined, brain included, and to protect from paracetamol intoxication in the rat.*

&#x200B;

*Here, we demonstrate that N-acetyl-L-cysteine ethyl ester (NACET), a lipophilic cell-permeable cysteine derivative, increases the viability in oxidative stressed RPE cells more efficiently than NAC by reacting directly and more rapidly with oxidizing agents, and that NACET, but not NAC, pretreatment predisposes RPE cells to oxidative stress resistance and increases the intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) pool available to act as natural antioxidant defense.*

&#x200B;

They don't just say that NACET is better. They say that NAC actually does nothing.

(And yet, it is well-established that oral NAC is effective treatment.)

(Because, naturally, if NACET is more effective, then I would look to see how much more effective, to see if it justified the cost, instead of just taking some extra NAC. (NAC is relatively inexpensive stuff.) I can't make such a comparison if the NACET research insists that NAC is actually useless.)",1685577223,jmes8ki,t3_vr4iup,t1_jmeqe5r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

BioBuild,"They say that because in these studies, NAC was ineffective at the doses provided. However, the dose of NAC was relatively low (e.g. equivalent to 700 to 800 mg for a typical adult human), so it's no surprise they didn't find it effective. NACET has an estimated 10-fold higher bioavailability than NAC so it's strange that they didn't adjust the dosage for NAC accordingly",1685580007,jmeyfct,t3_vr4iup,t1_jmes8ki,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
