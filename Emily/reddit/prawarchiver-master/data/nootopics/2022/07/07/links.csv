When I couldn't find it anywhere--not in all the databases of the internet, it became a bucket-list item: to acquire the Fundamentals to a Pharmacology of the mind--written by one of the foremost fathers of modern nootropics, the inventor of piracetam--and collect, scan, and organize it into the searchable, indexed .pdf I always wanted to find.

This project was, from the outset, a labor of love--love of knowledge, and love of the nootropics community.

All I ask is that anyone reading through this tome could share whatever insights they find with me. I haven't read through it yet, but it seems like a fascinating book based off of my exposure to it while undergoing the painstaking process of scanning and OCR'ing all 400+ pages.

It is a life's work in a book. Giurgea, I salute you.
