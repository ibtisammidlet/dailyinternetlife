monkeysoflove,Wow this is awesome! I used benzos for 10 years but got addicted to them so I came off of them but I still have anxiety issues. I now use natural things but still struggle with paranoia/anxiety and issues leaving the house for long amounts of time. It's one of the reasons I have disability and work from home. This is so awesome! I cannot wait to take this and work outside the home with more ease!:D YAYY!,1659441201,iimr89r,t3_w0h9oq,t3_w0h9oq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sonnsonn,No perceivable effect for me but I am on hormone replacement therapy so my pheromones are already kind of maxed out. For someone with less hormones in their body already I imagine it might have some noticeable effects,1659041719,ii1h3pw,t3_w0h9oq,t1_ii1gu9e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Anathema93,"There is some info on pglchem site that it says they have contributed to it but it's password protected. I don't know exactly what that is. 
Also they have some special forms of ISRIB . That it too is patented by a company , on r/isrib you will find some more info on this.
They must have their connections
I also have it in my possession but haven't tried it yet.",1658337763,igxww69,t3_w0h9oq,t1_igmnggq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
