Hyperionxvii,"Wow, that seems like a lot. I can feel the 1/3 tsp I just took quite nicely, took with potassium citrate, but I take that daily a few times. Not sure which has the worst taste, the potassium or the piracetam, lol, both quite unpleasant. But it's probably been at least a year since I've taken it, and that was capsules, not powder, but I've always found the effect even at lower doses to be very nice, makes me very focused and a little more ambitious than usual, at the same time really calm and sort of more socialable feeling than I am most of the time. I especially like it in the morning with coffee. It's been my favorite nootropic since I started taking them, not sure why I quit taking it, just trying so many different things. Lately only been taking Ashwaganda in evening, and occasionally phenibut which I have to be careful with because it makes me nauseous if I take too much.",1657754818,ig2420b,t3_vydljq,t1_ig1zjwi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hyperionxvii,"Thanks! How do you measure this stuff? It's really hard to tell based on what they are calling a 1/3 tsp. I don't have a scale, but I typically measure stuff thinking that 1/2 tsp is 2500mg, does that sound right?",1657749467,ig1riky,t3_vydljq,t1_ig1qgnv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
