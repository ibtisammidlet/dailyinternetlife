What is the best way to dose this? It comes with a little scoop that is 1/3 tsp, which is apparently somewherewhere between 800-1000mg. I stuck in my finger and gave a taste, well it is pretty bitter. Is this water soluble? 

Anyway, I searched and am not really finding too much, I saw a couple of comments saying 1.2-3.6 grams a day. 

Anyone got any advice? If so, thanks in advance.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Piracetam Powder,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/vydljq/piracetam_powder/
