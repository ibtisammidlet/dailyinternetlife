Talking about receptor sites and it's respective binding affinities at those receptor sites. I know it ""elevates dopamine"" and serotonin, and that it's purportedly a DRI and an SRI and that it elevates gaba via enzymatic breakdown inhibition and that it elevates tyrosine hydroxylase, etc yada yada yada ... So not talking about all this internet bro lore, but I am interested in numbers, percentages and especially in what brain areas it effects what and how much.

It's a very powerful ""nootropic"" but it seems like everybody is taking it on faith alone, not knowing what exactly it's doing, which seem kinda moronic tbh.

I tried it a couple of times and it was very powerful, was never able to sleep without sleep aids and even then it was shitty sleep. Two days ago I tried it again, took 100mg intranasal (to big of a dose for sure). Libido went through the roof as did mood, motor movement patterns, etc. But the next day it started to turn into agitation, it felt a lot more noradrenergic then it did on the first day (but still very dopaminergic), again had to take sleep aids. 3rd day from taking it I still feel it, but it's lessened a lot but hard to gauge bc of all the gabaergic aids for sleep last day. So now I'm thinking maybe 10 - 20mg's intranasal every day? But still, would really appreciate knowing more about it, especially it's action on the serotonin system.

Anyway, kindly appreciate any info you can muster! tnx",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane's Mechanism Of Action?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w13t7w/bromantanes_mechanism_of_action/
