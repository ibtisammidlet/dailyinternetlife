Decreased need for sleep

for DMG:

DMG helps my sleep tremendously when I'm in the mountains. (lol?)

I am not sure I need a decreased need for sleep - I had high hopes for sarcosine. Some folks in here also advise against glycine altogether. But why? Yes, glycine can be synthesized out of serine, but serine can be synthesized out of threonine (and even out of glycine, as many reactions are reversible). Why not take threonine instead then, if we are going all the way back to the source?",False,t5_4aoxhu,TMG/DMG/Sarcosine for sleep?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w7mr0t/tmgdmgsarcosine_for_sleep/
