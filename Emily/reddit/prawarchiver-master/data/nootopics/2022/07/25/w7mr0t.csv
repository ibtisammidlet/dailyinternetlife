analXplorer,"I’ve read experiences with TMG and better sleep, but never tried it myself. It seems generally to give me energy and decrease inflammation, both of which I don’t want to do around bed time. I’m taking it in the morning though.

Personally I use Taurine and Glycine before bed - works well and no tolerance. I can definitely see the arguments against using both of these… but it works

Lately I’ve also been using Ceylon Cinnamon 2.5g. Feels like I’m waking up less groggy - like my BS and breathing’s been better during the night.

Additionally I’ve never had any success with nmdar antagonism close to bed - my hypothesis is that the glutamate activity is being increased at other receptors causing me to wake up early and/or sleep lighter",1658758354,ihkvv8b,t3_w7mr0t,t3_w7mr0t,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Isn't decreasing inflammation good at any time? Taking a NSAID every day (like ibuprofen) supposedly extends life?

Yeah, I also am taking Taurine and Glycine (and more), but why would anyone have anything to say against those? Taurine is good for the eyes, a huge + for me.

Did you every try glutamine before bed?",1658759154,ihkxr1l,t3_w7mr0t,t1_ihkvv8b,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
analXplorer,"Not really, it’s more dependable. You’d want a bit higher tnf alpha closer to bedtime. I think this is something that’s also noticeable - if your inflamed you’d get more tired. 

One of the things both Taurine and Glycine does is agonising GABA A receptors. There’s other things which might give you reasons to not use them - which I don’t remember now.

I do take glutamine, but in the morning.
I fast and drink huge amounts of coffee, it might help a bit - not sure.

I think you should closer define what you think would be beneficial to affect for you in relation to sleep. Some of these could be:
- Adenosine
- GABA B
- Sleep wake cycles
- Cholinergic activity
- Growth factors
- Blood sugar 
- etc…",1658761211,ihl2quk,t3_w7mr0t,t1_ihkxr1l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"A bit of GABA can't do any harm, a little pheni helps me a lot before bed. It's ever harder to purchase anything here. Glycine isn't bad for me, I was just trying to do more than just glycine with DMG/TMG. Methionine is rare and if some it gets recycled, that's good, I guess. Alternatively, I could take just glycine and some other methyl group donor.

EDIT: Leonurus cardiaca extract before bed?",1658765591,ihldwur,t3_w7mr0t,t1_ihl2quk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
