ChasingHealth,"Nice writeup. I want to point out that methamphetamine, while neurotoxic in high recreational doses, is also a prescription drug that is (admittedly rarely) prescribed for ADHD and narcolepsy. In therapeutic doses (~10mg orally, rather than 100-500mg smoked, snorted, or injected) it's not really much more dangerous than regular amphetamine. I would imagine the amount created by selegeline metabolism is closer to the therapeutic dose, although I havent looked at studies yet. Really interesting notes though, thanks for posting! What's been the best for you personally?",1657985436,igekuk6,t3_w0iiqj,t3_w0iiqj,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,"How do we feel about Sabroxy and Or Modafinil as cleaner DRI’s? 

I’ve also heard strangely that Polygala and Mematine have both helped with ADHD symptoms as well. Why do you think so?",1658041369,ighpvd6,t3_w0iiqj,t3_w0iiqj,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"Great write up! I've found methylphenidate to be the most helpful for my ADHD of anything I've tried, and that includes amphetamine. Amphetamine salts are definitely more recreational, but that's not sustainable for everyday use at least for me. 

I am interested in adding supplements/nootropics that would work well alongside the methylphenidate.",1658233330,igrp6b2,t3_w0iiqj,t3_w0iiqj,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
herbalist65pete,"This will be the second time you've heard of the sigma-1 receptor in a week. Do a deep dive into it. 

I should do a write up but busy at the moment. Two key cellular signaling pathway molecules you need to grasp. One via MAOI effects to prevent serotonin degradation (polygala & memantine), the other serotonin itself. DMT is nearly identical to serotonin.

Basically this is an ayahuasca recipe, using an maoi and serotonin mimetic, which directly targets the sigma-1 receptor, via creating a serotonin surge. https://deoxy.org/ayadef.htm

Among many pathways it modulates is the claustrum neuronal network, your consciousness. Here a pleuthora of disease states are addressed. Dementia, neuralgia, depression, anxiety, alzheimer's and even displacing the spike protein created from C-19, via chaperoning activity at the endoplasmic reticulum level. We are talking about deep ties to mitochondrial integrity via calcium influx channels.

I hope this helps with ideas for you to research.

All pretty heady stuff.

Also, I recommend researching sananga.  I find this, along with rapé, to be significant modalities to improve brain function and cognition.",1658050961,igi1ejq,t3_w0iiqj,t1_ighpvd6,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
