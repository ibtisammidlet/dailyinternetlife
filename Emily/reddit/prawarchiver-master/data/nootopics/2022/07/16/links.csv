So my question is why does quitting nicotine/tobacco make me feel like this?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Quitting Smoking(tobacco) mental health benefits mechanisms!?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w0u6j0/quitting_smokingtobacco_mental_health_benefits/

Avenues for optimal productivity, from all my years of research:

&#x200B;

***PART 1: THE NUTRACEUTICAL ROUTE***

**1) A high quality multivitamin.**

&#x200B;

**2) A blend of Omega 3 and Omega 6 oils (Omega 9 is optional).**

&#x200B;

**3) Methyl donors: Methylfolate, Methyl-B12, Trimethylglycine.**

&#x200B;

**4) Antioxidants: Coenzyme Q10, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Reduced Glutathione.**

&#x200B;

**5) Herbs: Ginkgo Biloba, Rhodiola Rosea, (potentially) Bacopa Monnieri.**

\----------

&#x200B;

***PART 2: THE PHARMACEUTICAL ROUTE***

**1) A stimulant medication. Example: Methylphenidate. Another option is Amphetamine, although this comes with greater risk.**

&#x200B;

**2) Nicotine.**

\>> NOTE 1: Even if used alone (ie. *Nicotine Replacement Therapy*) this drug does have addictive potential.

&#x200B;

**3) The atypical antidepressant Bupropion.**

\>> NOTE 1: This may be disadvantageous to some as it blocks *Nicotinic Receptors*, thus ablating the stimulant effect of **Nicotine**, if used.

\>> NOTE 2: May have the potential to induce or exacerbate anxiety by acting as a *negative modulator of GABA-A receptors* (ie. the opposite of what Benzodiazepines do). That said, this exact same mechanism may contribute to an enhanced stimulant effect. So it's hard to say for sure.

&#x200B;

**4) A monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Various types (see notes below).**

\>> NOTE 1: To be used in caution if used alongside a stimulant. If used in combination, you run the risk of causing hypertension or even cardiac arrest.

\>> NOTE 2: Essentially a 'hell-no' if you're already using an SSRI or SNRI, as this can lead to the fatal complication ""*Serotonin Syndrome*"", especially if you're using irreversible inhibitors (see below).

\>> NOTE 3: it is unclear whether MAO-A or MAO-B has a greater part to play, or if they are equivalent. 

\>>>> NOTE 3a: Regarding the above dilemma, successful studies have been conducted using the drug **Selegiline**, which should act as a selective MAO-B inhibitor 

\>>>> NOTE 3b: BUT you must note that **Selegiline** loses its selectivity for MAO-B at higher doses, so it's hard to tell for sure if MAO-B inhibition alone is in fact the key.

\>>>> NOTE 3c: More disturbingly, the oral form of **Selegiline** is metabolised in the liver into a neurotoxic metabolite: *L-Methamphetamine*.

\>>>> NOTE 3d: **Selegiline** is definitely not a good option if you're on a medication that strongly blocks CYP2D6 (eg. Fluoxetine) as this would greatly enhance and prolong the action of the neurotoxic metabolite *L-Methamphetamine*. 

\>>>> NOTE 3e: The patch form of **Selegiline**, ""**EMSAM**"", bypasses this neurotoxic conversion, making it very safe in comparison to the oral version, but it is much harder to get ahold of.

\>>>> NOTE 3f: There are 2 much older irreversible inhibitors of both MAO-A and MAO-B: **Phenelzine** and **Tranylcypromine**. Issue with these is that **Phenelzine** also blocks the degradation of GABA across the body and brain, and has the potential to induce liver toxicity. **Tranylcypromine** lacks both of these side effects, but you must note that since both drugs block MAO-A and MAO-B irreversibly, you really have to be cautious with what other medications you take, and even your diet - otherwise you are literally playing Russian Roulette with your life. Plus, these days, they aren't so easy to get ahold of.

\>>>> NOTE 3g: The safer option for MAO-B would be **Rasagiline**, as it has no toxic metabolites. However, it is only approved for Parkinson's Disease.

\>>>> NOTE 3h: The safer option for MAO-A would be either **Moclobemide** (available in Europe, Canada or Australia), or **Pirlindole** (available in Russia), or **Bifemelane** (available in Japan).

&#x200B;

**5) An alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, which disinhibits the release of norepinephrine and also indirectly dopamine and serotonin. Option 1 for this: Mirtazapine. Option 2 for this: Yohimbine.**

\>> NOTE 1: Although only cited academically at this stage, **Mirtazapine** may in fact also act as a partial agonist of the *Kappa-Opioid receptor*. Activation of this receptor can cause intense dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. It is purely speculative at this point, but this side effect may potentially offset the beneficial effects of **Mirtazapine's** main action.

\>>>> NOTE 1a: From my research, the closest thing to replicating Mirtazapine's actions would be: ***A)*** **Yohimbine** for *Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors* (See NOTE 2 below), ***B)*** **Quetiapine** or **Maprotiline** for *5-HT2 receptors* \[note: **Quetiapine** is easily available, **Maprotiline** is much harder to find\], and ***C)*** **Ondansetron** for *5-HT3 receptors* \[but note: this drug is only approved for Nausea, Vomiting and Gastroenteritis\].

\>> NOTE 2: **Yohimbine** is the only other drug which potently inhibits the *alpha-2 adrenergic receptor*. However, it may have the potential to cause intense anxiety or cardiovascular symptoms due to the *extreme disinhibition of norepinephrine release*. I don't believe this drug is even used as a prescription drug, worldwide.

&#x200B;

**6) A low dose of either Amisulpride or Sulpiride (by this I mean the minimum dosage: 50mg, applicable to both drugs). Both drugs at this minimum dosage appear to act as selective blockers for dopamine autoreceptors, thus leading to enhanced dopamine release through reduced negative feedback. Compared side to side, it's extremely difficult to determine which is superior - but it must be noted that the vast majority of studies noting beneficial effects were done using Amisulpride.**

&#x200B;

**7) The novel medication Bromantane. This is essentially the wildcard here. I don't believe this drug is used clinically anywhere outside of Russia. That said, it has a rather unique mechanism of action: increasing the activity of enzymes that synthesize dopamine and norepinephrine, amongst other mechanisms. Not a lot of research has been done outside of academic interest, and of course it is hard to get ahold of as it is not prescribed virtually anywhere in the world.**",False,t5_4aoxhu,Pathways to productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w0iiqj/pathways_to_productivity/
