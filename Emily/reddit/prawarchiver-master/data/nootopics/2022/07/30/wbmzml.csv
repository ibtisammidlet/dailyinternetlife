DeathByThousandCats,"NSAIDs simply raise the lithium level in the blood by making it exchanged less through kidney. I’m not a doc and this is not medical advice, but 300mg is way less than the amount that would usually land within therapeutic window of blood concentration, let alone toxic level, unless you are extremely petite or have preexisting renal complications. I’ve lived with 900 mg for 12 years with occasional aspirin here and there (but not chronic). Your doc was probably raising the dose gradually. When in doubt, ask your own psych and get a blood work, not here.",1659162033,ii88sxm,t3_wbmzml,t3_wbmzml,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
