I believe GABA is the chemical that controls you actually getting off your backside and being active.

Bupropion is a novel stimulant-like drug that doesn't just raise dopamine and norepinephrine; it also blocks several GABA receptors. For this reason, Bupropion appears to be a novel drug that can enhance drive and activity in ways that even classic stimulants like Ritalin and Amphetamine cannot. Unfortunately, Bupropion seems to affect so many GABA receptors that it doesn't just cause increased drive, it can also exacerbate anxiety.

GABA in general is a double edged sword: increasing it can kill anxiety and stress, but at the cost of reduced drive, energy and motivation.

Well thankfully it's not black and white like that. It turns out there are actually several sub-components of the GABA-A receptor (ie. several GABA-A receptors rather than just one). Each has its own interesting individual function. Good news suggest that specific ones control anxiety, and other specific ones control sedation/reduced drive.

So going back to Bupropion, it would appear that this drug appears both types globally.

So the question is: are there any nootropics that preferentially block the GABA-A receptor subtypes that only affect motivation, whilst leaving the anxiety-blocking ones untouched? From my research thus far, the natural herb Ginkgo Biloba appears to be the only (available) substance that fulfills this criteria.",False,t5_4aoxhu,*NERDS ONLY* Is there a clever way of blocking certain GABA receptors so you get the enhanced stimulation but without raising anxiety levels?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/we0lwk/nerds_only_is_there_a_clever_way_of_blocking/
