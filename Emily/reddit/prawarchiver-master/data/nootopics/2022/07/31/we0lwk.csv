sirsadalot,"I don't think blocking GABA is the answer, but rather modulating glutamate.

This is why the newer things I'm coming out with such as TAK-653 and Neboglamine will be based on that.",1659414369,iilqjik,t3_we0lwk,t3_we0lwk,18,False,t5_4aoxhu
Big_Position3037,"Gaba-a antagonists have some stimulating effects at lower doses, but they also have convulsant effects at higher doses. Thujone is a Gaba-a antagonist, and it apparently has some stimulating effects. Although it's popular due to absinth, that's probably not a great way to get a dose-- absinthe has a really small amount of thujone. Maybe try some wormwood extract? But there aren't a lot of gaba-a antagonists. The convulsive effects make it an unsafe option for medication. Instead, look at Gaba NAMs, or negative allosteric modulator. 

Benzos are PAMS, positive allosteric modulators, and they increase Gaba receptor activity by changing the shape of the receptor to bind to GABA molecules better. NAMs are the opposite- they block GABA. They also can cause convulsions, anxiety, and stimulation. With NAMs, though, there are more selective drugs. NAMs of the Gaba a5 receptor like Basmisanil show memory enhancing effects.* L-655,708 and MRK-016 produce rapid antidepressant effects.** I'm not sure how much development is happening on these targets currently, to be honest.

RowanRedd,"Alcohol seems to do that (for me at least). Gives me much more motivation/energy (all the perceived obstacles/aversion lifted) and at the same time almost completely remove any anxiety.

odder_sea,"First off, I think sirsad is right, getting glutamate modulated is more pressing for sure.

Though I think you are simultaneously leaning in the right way looking at targeting specific GABA receptors.

Ginkgo is probably the most promising herb, I suspect that Ceylon Cinnamon might also possibly have a similar select modulation of GABA.

I'll try to dig up the sources for that, I haven't been able to locate the place I read that, so huge grain of salt.

I can say subjectively, that they have a broadly similar ""feel"" as far as promoting a more ""motivated, wakeful focus""",1659460188,iio0j2g,t3_we0lwk,t3_we0lwk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
wikirex,"I also agree with other comments that blocking GABA-A receptors does not at first glance appear to be the mechanism of action or the neurotransmitter that would give you the effects you are after. 

Also ginkgo biloba has risks with causing red blood cell fragility. 

Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19143753/
“G. biloba leaf extract also exhibited damage to red blood cells by increasing cell fragility, changing cellular morphology and inducing glutathione consumption and methaemoglobin formation, especially when applied at high doses. These anti- and pro-oxidative activities of polyphenolic substances are thought to be involved in the dual function of G. biloba leaf extract. The results of this study suggest that high doses of herbal remedies and dietary supplements can be toxic to cells.”

You say you want stimulation without anxiety. There are a few answers, the first that comes to mind are the racetams with a choline source. For example, OmegaTAU and Oxiracetam would be effective. You could add in L-theanine or magnolia bark if you still have any anxiety. For more stimulation you could add ALCAR.",1659515660,iiraueb,t3_we0lwk,t3_we0lwk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

herbalist65pete,"Tinctures with right polyphenols and extracts coupled with low dose grain alcohol, is a major hormetic fix. A sweet spot of a toxic substance, example being curcumin/turmeric - slightly toxic to system  but activates the Nrf2 cellular signaling pathways via hormesis to stimulate body's own activation of major anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidants, can have significant impact on modulating epigenetic signaling pathways. Too much, and it is overwhelmingly toxic to body. Again, sweet spot-modulation.

Serotonin pathways and modulation are equally fascinating. Effects at the mitochondrial level via endoplasmic reticulum where sigma 1 receptors do some serious modulation of calcium channels.

sirsadalot,"Both candidates are projectedly stimulating in some capacity, exciting the prefrontal cortex. Their ability to treat anxiety revolves around promoting beneficial synaptogenesis, which is dysregulated in anxiety disorders. So by enhancing learning in non-threatening states, the brain reroutes from anxiety-inducing cues. This applies mainly to Neboglamine, because this is demonstrated more with the NMDA glycine site, however it would make sense if the same happened through AMPA potentiation.

Since these are the most articulated cognitive enhancers mechanistically, improved adaptability is very much expected.",1659426027,iim79i0,t3_we0lwk,t1_iim441h,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
