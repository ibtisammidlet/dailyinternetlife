With my ADHD and anxiety I can't even take Qualia Mind No Caffeine or Mindlab Pro without being my anxiety going up. I get mean and impatient and etc. It's very hard to try different prescribed medicines because of weeks of time of trying out only to endure different side effects for each. I basically need non-stimulant that can help me to focus calmly and came to this conclusion. I'm not sure in what form or brand I should take or shall I just get each online and take them together? Any advise will be appreciated.,False,t5_4aoxhu,"How do I use L-theanine, L-Tyrosine and Gaba together?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/w6fio5/how_do_i_use_ltheanine_ltyrosine_and_gaba_together/
