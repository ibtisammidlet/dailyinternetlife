I've been seeing all kinds of conflicting information from people researching this chemical so I'm hoping to reach some consensus with this post.

**Dosing and RoA:** 

[bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co) lists 1g as 20-40 days of research material, i.e. 50-25mg per day, with no recommended route of administration to subjects. Psychonautwiki (a source I've found to generally be on point) says on the other hand ""Due to \[coluracetam's\] short acting and acute nature the preferred ROAs are generally insufflation, sublingual, or vaporisation"", adding that ""the active dose range of this compound is 5-20mg"" and ""Dosages higher than 20mg do not seem to offer any additional benefit."" 

For those who have researched this compound, what RoA and what dosage(s) did you try?

**Choline Source:**

Conventional wisdom around racetams says that they should be taken with a source of choline. For those who have researched this both with and without choline, was there any tangible difference? Same goes for different forms of choline.

**Subjective Experiences:**

What subjective effects have been reported by coluracetam research subjects? Were these felt acutely or gradually? Did they remain consistent or fade over time?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Coluracetam Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yayegp/coluracetam_discussion/
