ArtificialBrain808,"Nice for a mood lift, but not much stimulation. Dosing over 30mg turns me into a bitchy mess. Also heard it did not require a choline source. Usually used it back when I played lots of video games. Still have 5G from ND lol, probably 5 years old by now. Looking back I feel like it is/was similar to kanna, but I haven’t used either in years. Light antidepressant action with brighter colors. Easy for me to overdo due to the acetylcholine increase",1666485816,itefo4r,t3_yayegp,t3_yayegp,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
