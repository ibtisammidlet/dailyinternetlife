Cappin_The_Turtle,"Bromantane + Tropisetron + Agmatine Sulfate + Tongkat Ali

Bromantane is great for both confidence and anxiety. Increased dopamine, lowered cortisol, lowered fatigue, and performance-enhancing effects ensure you feel confident and stress-free.

Tropisetron effectively makes me less self-conscious, which helps with social anxiety. It has also been shown in studies to be anxiolytic and help OCD (less rumination). It also increases cognition which is helpful.

Agmatine sulfate helps a lot of people see the world in a better light, and it is extremely effective for depression. This should help for social anxiety.

Tongkat Ali has androgenic and anxiolytic effects which will help you feel your best


A superior option to all of these is weight training and eating better",1666130976,isv0dtx,t3_y72n6s,t3_y72n6s,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
