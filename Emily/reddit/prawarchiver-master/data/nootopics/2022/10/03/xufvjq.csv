sirsadalot,"Also to note from this study was a limited psychostimulant profile and no subjective feeling of the drug, which is consistent with our trials with it.

**Abstract:** TAK-653 is a novel AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to measure the functional pharmacodynamic central nervous system (CNS) effects of TAK-653. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover (placebo, TAK-653 0.5 mg and 6 mg) study with 24 healthy volunteers was performed. NeuroCart tests consisting of body sway (BS), saccadic peak velocity (SPV), smooth pursuit eye movements (SP), adaptive tracking (AT), Bowdle and Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (B-VAS and BL-VAS) and Stroop test were performed pre-dose and 3.5 and 4 h post-dose. Data were analysed using a mixed model analysis of covariance with baseline as covariate. It was found that TAK-653 did not affect BS and subjective drug effects as measured by B-VAS and BL-VAS at either dose level. TAK-653 0.5 mg increased SPV (degrees/second) (19.49 [5.98, 32.99], P = 0.02) and affected Stroop difference in reaction time between correct congruent and correct incongruent answers and number of correct responses in incongruent trials (22.0 [4.0, 40.0], P = 0.05 and -0.3 [-0.5, -0.1], P = 0.02, respectively). TAK-653 6 mg improved AT (%) (1.68 [0.51, 2.84], P = 0.02) and increased SPV (degrees/s) (15.40 [1.91, 28.90], P = 0.06) and SP (%) (2.32 [0.37, 4.27], P = 0.05). Based on these findings it can be concluded that TAK-653 demonstrated a psychostimulant-like pharmacodynamic profile on the NeuroCart consistent with previously reported increase of cortical excitability following Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of the human motor cortex.",1664793890,iqv8zst,t3_xufvjq,t3_xufvjq,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

nordr,"Hitching my comment to this wagon to gush effusively about three things:

1.	the radical positive impact that both Bromantane and TAK-653 have had on my life;
2.	the evangelizing role that you’ve played in increasing awareness of, and access to (through everychem), these products, and;
3.	the quality of your product and your *prices*.

I’ve struggled—really struggled—with treatment resistant bipolar depression for most of my adult life. Later, I developed a substance use disorder in the course of trying to self-medicate. I’ve routinely “pooped out” on various combinations of SSRIs, SNRIs, and mood stabilizers (with the sole exception of lamotrigine). Ketamine simply isn’t an option, for obvious reasons. Both Bromantane and TAK-653 have checked every box for everything I have to consider with any treatment method. 

I did this in consultation with my doctor, and she’s been floored by the change. We were at the point of seriously considering electroconvulsive therapy. I know this might sound like an ad to some. Feel free to check my account age. I’m ancient by Reddit standards. I’m getting nothing for this other than the opportunity to maybe help someone else in a responsible way. Thank you so much for being so relentless and honest in your advocacy, and for keeping it so affordable for the average person. Much metta.",1676396428,j8izm53,t3_xufvjq,t1_j6xo4gx,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
antimantium,"The model states that AMPA is bottom-up and NMDA is top-down information processing. So, AMPA agonism should make raw sensory information clearer or stronger, and NMDA antagonism should make preconception and abstractions either weaker or of a lower developmental age. 

Edit: obviously the model has nuance, and this summary isn't entirely close to the truth.",1664836004,iqxyx9l,t3_xufvjq,t1_iqxxisp,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
