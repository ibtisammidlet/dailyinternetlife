A lot of the substances on this subreddit are new to me.

Currently, my daily stack consists of the following:

-	Emoxypine Succinate
-	Pregnenolone
-	DHEA
-	Scrotal Bio-Testosterone Cream
-	Bovine non-defatted organ powders
-	TUDCA
-	Sustained release NAC

I’m looking for something that helps my cognition, specifically motivation and general ADHD symptoms without taking a toll on my kidneys. I’ve seen mention here of D Serine but I came across some research that shows potential for organ damage. Looking for something that hopefully has a high safety profile. Prohormones are always welcome 

I’ve struggled with a mysterious acute kidney injury that has spiked my blood pressure and observed markers of proteinuria that’s probably from oxidative stress. 

Trying to stay away from Adderal, and other substances that spike my adrenalin/cortisol/blood pressure/stress.

The stack above has brought my symptoms down, but I still feel heavily affected by classic ADHD/PTSD symptoms.

Thank you!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Suggestions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/y47vt7/suggestions/
