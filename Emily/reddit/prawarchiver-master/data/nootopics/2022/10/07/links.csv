Have you noticed any effect on your perception of effort? That is, do tasks requiring mental effort seem less or more difficult at all on it?

I ask this based on two leaps of bro-science, both of which may be way out of line (lol). First, effort processing has apparently been linked to top-down attention. I saw this mentioned in a review article, though it was uncited and I can't find any corroborating evidence for it. Second, the theory that AMPA mediates top-down processing while NMDA mediates bottom-up processing.

Again, one or both of these might be either false or a gross oversimplification, but wondering if anyone has noticed anything in this regard.",False,t5_4aoxhu,TAK-653 and Effort Perception,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/xz407n/tak653_and_effort_perception/
