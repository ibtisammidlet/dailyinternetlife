sirsadalot,"No difference in effort perception or motivation, it's just that it feels like my thinking while on it is perfected in a way that propels me to make better decisions.

Effort perception is something that I struggle with as someone with CFS/ autoimmune issues and I find that low dose Naltrexone and cycling Pemoline and Bromantane nasal spray helps to correct my behavior.

Another key thing I can't stress enough is to make sure you're not OCD, because if you are then you can easily get hung up on something in your subconscious and procrastinate on more important tasks.

I also want to touch down on AMPA/ NMDA and note that while they are technically different, they coactivate eachother and share a dynamic in a way that makes their effects harder to differentiate. For instance AMPA PAMs can activate NR2B, and NMDA activation requires AMPA activation.",1665269670,irkfd8u,t3_xz407n,t3_xz407n,10,False,t5_4aoxhu
