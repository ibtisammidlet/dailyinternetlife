Alhakawati,"How does one, upregulates/increase vmat2?

we generated VMAT2-overexpressing mice using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to determine whether increased vesicular packaging could provide an elevation of monoamine output in a mammalian system. We report here that VMAT2-overexpressing mice (VMAT2-HI) have increased vesicle capacity, increased synaptic dopamine release, improved outcomes on anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and reduced vulnerability to toxic insult by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). These data demonstrate that the manipulation of vesicular capacity is capable of providing a sustained enhancement of the dopamine system and suggest that the vesicle is a viable therapeutic target for numerous monoamine-deficient disorders.

Because VMAT2-HI mice show both increased dopamine release and increased extracellular dopamine levels, we anticipated that there would be compensatory changes to DAT or other dopamine mediators. However, VMAT2-HI mice show no differences in levels of DAT or TH (Fig. S2), nor in indirect estimates of transmitter clearance by voltammetry (rate constant, tau) and microdialysis (extraction fraction). These data suggest that the enhancement of the dopamine system is sustained without major compensatory changes to other mediators of presynaptic dopamine dynamics in the VMAT2-HI mice. In addition, VMAT2-HI mice display and maintain monoamine-mediated behavioral phenotypes, suggesting that receptor levels or function have not overcome these presynaptic alterations.",1665184124,irgjsg0,t3_xyd0hv,t3_xyd0hv,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
Snoo-82170,"I didn't understand. Wouldn't increasing VMAT2 cause more monoamines to be pulled out of the synapse? Or by the increase, does he mean the decrease in transporter activity?",1665193133,irgzz86,t3_xyd0hv,t3_xyd0hv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
funkehfresh,"I'm understanding that there is some likelihood that moderate upregulation of dopamine influx to the synapse, and activity at post synaptic receptors, will not cause an equal and opposite compensatory downregulation. Rather, the net effect may be likely that the overall system is upregulated, functioning better than it otherwise would or ever could. This is exactly what amphetamine achieves, except by reversing DAT, which functions then effectively as VMAT. This is an incredible study. Soon everyone will be on speed.

Extremely highly motivated and ambitious and is extremely successful and he built it all himself, came from a very low socio-economic class, I guess it's definitely a mix of nature/nurture.

funkehfresh,"The net effect of the overactivity of VMAT in this study is the same as is seen in the presence of amphetamine; increased post-synaptic activation. The leverage points differ, which seems to be a secondary detail. That is until we are able to manipulate human genetics as was done to these lucky mice. What I learned here is that the dopamine system can be upregulated permanently and sustainably. That is an amazing discovery.

Moreover, mesembrine and the other Kanna alkaloids also inhibit serotonin transporter, so the overall subjective effect of kanna is dopaminergic and serotonergic.

funkehfresh,"In the first study, for an 80kg person like me, the doses used are roughly 20mg, 40mg, and 160mg per day. It suggests that amphetamine may facilitate neurogenesis to some degree. I speculate, and maybe they touch on this somewhere in this study, that the lower two doses would provide the most benefit with the least detrimental side effects. The second study is more of the same.

I remember a study that found neuroprotective effects too but I'll find it later.
