What I haven't seen much of however are thoughts around how the brain handles sensory input. 

I'm not thinking so much about improving the sense itself (though I'd love my full sense of smell back after COVID/moldy apartments), but what the brain does with the information it gets (better sense i.e. higher quality information is always preferable of course). 

For example, in loud environments I have an incredibly hard time parsing what people are saying, even if they're talking directly into my ear. Or imagine if there was something that sped up the brain's ability to process raw visual input - accelerating the speed at which light hitting the cornea gets converted to meaningful information. 

Do such compounds exist? It seems like a fascinating avenue of study.",False,t5_4aoxhu,What do we know about enhancing senses?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/y3bmfw/what_do_we_know_about_enhancing_senses/
