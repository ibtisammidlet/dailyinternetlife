Jester2432,"I disagree.
I've not only read all of the studies but I have also trialed it for 3 months against a placebo.

Coluracetam shines when it comes to Verbal memory due to it improving HACU (High Affinity Choline Uptake)
It has a small impact on WM as well.",1665752867,isa8onv,t3_y3bmfw,t1_is8mhmi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Jester2432,"And you're certain it's not just a placebo?

Like I mentioned in my previous comment, I trialed it for months and I felt nothing akin to what you're describing.   


I don't know if you own Coluracetam in capsule form but a good experiment that you could do to semi-confirm your hypothesis would be to get someone (an assistant) to give you empty capsules that are the same size as Coluracetam for 7 days and actual Coluracetam capsules for 7 days (random order).   


If Coluracetam really does affect your visual processing to the degree that you claim it does, then you should get all the days right at the end of the experiment.",1665857249,isfyo8n,t3_y3bmfw,t1_isadtbd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"It is inferior in practically every way. There are no human studies assessing safety, its pharmacokinetics and half life are worse, it most likely has much greater agonist potential than TAK-653. 

TAK-653 has the strongest selectivity to the allosteric site out of all AMPA PAMs which simultaneously makes it one of the most effective cognitive enhancers with lowest seizure risk. Because AMPA agonists cause cognitive impairment and seizures.

TAK-653 was also recently given a human study proving its nootropic effects but we already could infer that from other drugs of its class.",1665708376,is89pxm,t3_y3bmfw,t1_is89aeo,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
