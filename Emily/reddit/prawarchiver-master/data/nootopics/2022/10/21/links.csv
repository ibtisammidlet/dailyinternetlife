In other words, blocking the inflammatory cytokines could potentially increase infectious burden to an unhealthy level, so supplementing additionally with anti-infectious agents seems crucial.

I'm mentioning this because of a quote from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/): ""Through immunosuppression, Amantadine alleviates inflammatory
cytokines, leading to an indirect inhibition to HDAC that ultimately upregulates neurotrophins such as BDNF and GDNF.[76] This transaction is simultaneously responsible for its neuroprotective effects to dopamine neurons.[42] Bromantane reduces inflammatory cytokines[75] and was shown to inhibit HDAC as well.[77] Literature suspects its sensitizing properties to be mediated through neurotrophins[78] and indeed the benefits of GDNF infusions in Parkinson's last years after discontinuation.[79]""

There is a jump made from talking about immunosuppression in amantadine to anti-inflammatory effects of bromantane, being good for raising GDNF.  What is GDNF distinctly better for than BDNF? Further, does bromantane *also* cause immunosuppression like amantadine?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane and usage with concurrent inflammation and infection,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/yaf687/bromantane_and_usage_with_concurrent_inflammation/
