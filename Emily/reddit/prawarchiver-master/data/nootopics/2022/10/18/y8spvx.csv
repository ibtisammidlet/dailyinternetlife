TwentyEight08,A couple of times I took Muсuna with L-theanine and it caused an irresistible effect of drowsiness - almost like a sleeping pill. Have you found anything else on this issue?,1675537198,j77sp0r,t3_y8spvx,t3_y8spvx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
YoungB11,"These guys are all very knowledgeable. I just wonder what's the reason behind adding a dopaminergic substance which seems to provide only raw L-Dopa to a sleep formula.

As far as I understand, the only thing that substance can do is turn into dopamine and that's it. I'm very aware of all the risk people around here say is associated with L-Dopa... Maybe there is some weird synergy with the other compounds but the thing is that they are not the only ones adding it to a sleep supplement so maybe there is something there.",1666280652,it2zhtp,t3_y8spvx,t1_it27hes,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
