Why would they include a dopamine precursor product in a sleep formula supplement? As far as I know, the common practice is to take dopamine precursors such as L-Tyrosine in the morning on an empty stomach because these promote wakefulness/motivation and more of the serotonin precursors such as L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP at night.

Gorilla Mind sleep has Mucuna pruriens on it:

And this one I came across by Huge, Hibernate, has a blend of 5-HTP, Tyrosine and Mucuna lol.

What's going on here? I'm a really bad sleeper and I always thought that dopamine supplements should be always taken in the early morning that's why I'd always avoid taking them too late.

I would be very surprised and pissed off in a way if taking tyrosine before bed actually led me to a long and restful sleep because it would contradict everything I learned about nootropics and neurotransmitters...",False,t5_4aoxhu,Sleep formulations containing Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/y8spvx/sleep_formulations_containing_mucuna_pruriens/
