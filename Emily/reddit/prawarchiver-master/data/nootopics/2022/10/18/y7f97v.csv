sirsadalot,"Idra-21 lacks the modern approach of tak-653, it's not as selective to the allosteric site and has 0 human safety studies. This makes it not only worse for cognition but much more risky, whereas TAK is proven.

Dihexa doesn't interest me, people seem to just think it's cool because it's more obscure or something. The mechanism isn't promising. And the dihexa company doesn't like nootropic vendors anyways.",1666133690,isv6nrb,t3_y7f97v,t1_isul42y,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

Agreeable-Suspect986,"I've had incredible results with Dihexa but it feels dangerous to me. 
What do you think about K as a nootropic ? Do you know how it would mix with TAK-653 ? 
Anyway thanks for your work, i'm about to order some TAK-653",1666137187,isveib0,t3_y7f97v,t1_isv6nrb,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
WorldAdditional4214,"Yeah you should receive an email with tracking once it ships. If your order included an item that was backordered then it won't ship until that item is back in stock. If it included bromantane, know that he just got that back in stock like 5 days ago and was prob busy making solutions since it's a really popular product. I heard he devised a way to make bottling solutions much quicker and was going to implement that soon. So he does know that he needs to ramp things up and is working on it, just be patient.",1666200002,isykmyf,t3_y7f97v,t1_isxlebl,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Greedy-Artichoke-416,"Yes I usually get an email with USPS tracking number once the order is shipped. But lately it seems  u/sirsadalot has just stopped responding.

He should hire a customer service rep, you can't run a business on a lemonade stand if you want to service few thousand customers, it does get overwhelming for a single person to cope with everything.",1666185653,isxlqkv,t3_y7f97v,t1_isxlebl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I got the ""order received"" email on the 15th, but haven't seen anything about shipping confirmation or tracking.

I also sent an email to the contact email address but haven't received a reply either.

Thanks for the help.",1666210693,iszcl1b,t3_y7f97v,t1_isynm73,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
WelcomeMasses,"Agreed. Running a business properly and keeping customers happy involves a lot more than just being knowledgeable or good at making a product.

sirsadalot,Check now. All orders from the 15th have been shipped. Yesterday I thought I got them all but I checked and there were two left from that date. Was a little bit backed up on supplies because the customer base has been expanding and I also am waiting on some factory equipment.,1666232624,it0rj1b,t3_y7f97v,t1_iszcl1b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
