OutrageousBit2164,"To me, stimulants suck. NAC 2000mg/day really helped like 50% my work ethic. A lot of people develop anecdotal anhedonia, despite studies show anhedonia improvment due to high dose NAC. YMMV 

Also if you don't have problems with cortisol throw out every adaptogen. For some reason even rhiodiola made me don't give a f*ck about what I have to do.

Moda/Ritalin made me jerk off all day, in my case NAC was a life changer :)

My ADHD brain is diff though, Stimulants only give you higher motivation and concentration. But you have to work out how to use it.

labratdream,Sabroxy is really weak. This is because very little is absorbed  orally like few percents. In order to work it few grams are required to feel the effect. Oroxylin A itself is much weaker DAT inhibitor than methylphenidate.

3ric843,"Sabroxy is weak in the sense that you don't feel much from it. But 100 mg reliably makes me more focused and less distracted. The difference is bigger when combined with caffeine, as caffeine makes me more easily distracted, but adding Sabroxy allows me to stay focused. Plus, it makes caffeine feel better overall.

Why don't you pop into /r/adhd or any Facebook group or Instagram page or offline support group and see how many people literally could not function in live before they got on medication. The people who take these drugs via legitimate prescription and see improvements in their lives vastly outnumber the people who abuse them.

>It may work for a while but it's not a long term positive change.

It's not a ""long term positive change"" because ADHD is a neurological disorder that doesn't go away.

Studies and clinical experience have shown that people settle on a dose and do not get tolerant.  The vast majority of people find their therapeutic dose and are able to stay on that same dose which stays effective.

People chasing a high or “feeling it” are different and most ppl with ADHD are not looking for that, we’re just looking to be able to do our laundry and not get fired from our jobs, not become superhuman everyday.",1667413405,iusif6o,t3_ydwpa6,t1_ity6dvc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
