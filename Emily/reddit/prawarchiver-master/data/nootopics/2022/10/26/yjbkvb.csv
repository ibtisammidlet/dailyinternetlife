MF3DOOM,Yes it would but intravenous administration is definitely superior as it skips first pass and anything that can hinder its absorption. I wanna try intravenous Piracetam one day.,1667325521,iunjocf,t3_yjbkvb,t3_yjbkvb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
ConnorGoFuckYourself,"Gotta ask about your reasoning re titanium dioxide, like it's in most toothpaste including those sold in the EU.

Also why not just buy piracetam powder as many vendors carry it and use gel caps?",1667337144,iuoegdn,t3_yjbkvb,t3_yjbkvb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"I cannot imagine that buying these vials in order to drink them is cheaper than just buying piracetam and paying for shipping.

Did you know the correct oral dosage is 4.8 grams per dose? The correct dosage is commonly misunderstood and many sites report too low a dose to really notice much effects (at least acutely, you might start to feel some effects with chronic lower dosages).
If you want the source for this info let me know and I'll look it up!


I don't know how much piracetam is in such a vial, but I expect you would need to drink multiple vials for just one dose...

On bromantane.co you can buy a tub of 150gr piracetam (=31 doses) for 24.99. The shipping is 20$ but this is first class shipping (was only a week from US to Europe).
Incl. shipping, if you buy one tub this would put you at 1.44$ per dose, buy two you go down to 1.20$, buy three and it's just 1$.
You could probably find cheaper sources as well, especially if you'd like to buy a 500gr package for a discounted price.

How much cost the vials you can get, and how much is in there?",1667340474,iuomux2,t3_yjbkvb,t3_yjbkvb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

PabloAnnie,"Additionally, seeing from the foto they are glass ampoules. When you open such an ampoule by breaking the top off, microscopic glass particles get in the vial. This can harm you and can be dangerous.

What you need to do is buy a syringe and filter needles to suck up the liquid in the ampoule. The filter needle filters these particles out, you can then remove the needle and squirt the syringe in you mouth.

These needles cost additional money as well. I tried buying them in my pharmacy, but they don't even have them... So you might need to order those online 

Example of a filter needle, but not the best price: https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/bd-nokor-filter-needles-with-5-micron-19g-x-1-50.html
(I'm not sure what the maximum filter size is to be safe, but these 5 microns ones are definitely good enough
