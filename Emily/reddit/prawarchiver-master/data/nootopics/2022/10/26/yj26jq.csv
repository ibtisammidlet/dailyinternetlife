aupri,My understanding is that kindling is caused by excitotoxicity destroying GABA neurons so it’s not the GABAergic effects that cause it but the withdrawal which a GABA A antagonist would mimic and thus likely worsen kindling,1667311261,iumjnj4,t3_yj26jq,t3_yj26jq,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
ilovedoxo,Alcoholics sometimes use homotaurine when coming off booze. Maybe it could be of use for benzo kindling,1667316432,iumw33i,t3_yj26jq,t3_yj26jq,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
defenestration01,"I don’t believe any evidence has been found for phenibut causing kindling. Many of the symptoms people claim to be kindling are just withdrawal symptoms or post effect anxiety. 

I’m not very researched in this subject but I don’t think kindling is a particularly reversible process. And the idea of taking a gaba antagonist also sounds horrible. Wouldn’t they induce exactly the symptoms you’re trying to avoid? Tremors, convulsions, anxiety, etc?",1667302326,ium2e3u,t3_yj26jq,t3_yj26jq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"GABA kindling causes someone to get dependent on a GABAergic substance faster the next time they abuse it. It also will make withdrawals the next time worse. Furthermore it causes someone to be more impulsive (even after the withdrawals are gone), which increases the chance you will use a GABAergic again. This cycle leads to addiction.

It is caused by withdrawing too quickly, so it can always be prevented with a taper (and supplements like for ex. magnesium). It's not like removing a bandage! In this case you'd rip open the wound if you don't take it slowly. Upside is a taper is much more comfortable, but requires enough self-control.

I don't know actually if it reverses with time. Hope so, for you and myself!",1667922214,ivk4m17,t3_yj26jq,t1_ium2e3u,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
