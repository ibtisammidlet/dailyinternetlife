The injection form includes only sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid as additives. So I was thinking of buying some piracetam injection vials (like in below picture) to drink them. 

Does pircatem injection form work when taken by oral route?

Hi guys

I'm having big trouble with distractions making it impossible for me to concentrate on reading and listening to stuff. I constantly get distracted by all kinds of thought when I try. Do you have any prefered noop in terms of making it easier for you to concentrate on a subject or a task for a longer period?
