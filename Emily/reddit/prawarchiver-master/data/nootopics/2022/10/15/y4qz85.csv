EchoingSimplicity,"Not cope. L-Theanine is mild but it's effects are certainly real, and for something so cheap I wouldn't judge anyone for wanting to give it a try. It's also one of the most reliable in it's effect. There's probably better options out there but there's nothing wrong with L-Theanine.",1665851508,isfky3j,t3_y4qz85,t3_y4qz85,11,False,t5_4aoxhu
flodereisen,"Taurine works much better for caffeine anxiety - 100% removes all anxiety in every case, as it simply and directly influences the mechanism generating the anxiety, i.e. by increasing GABA activation - and is much cheaper. 

I never understood the L-Theanine hype. Its effects profile is a messy mix, doing a lot of things not very efficiently, i.e. slighty shifting brainwave function, increasing catecholamine and serotonin signaling but biphasic depending on dosage etc. It *does* do something, but you can also just drink a strong chamomille tea for the same effects.",1665857926,isg09vi,t3_y4qz85,t3_y4qz85,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

ilovedoxo,High quality l-theanine is effective in treating generalized anxiety in my experience. As a nootropic it helps me get into a creative flow state especially when writing or playing instruments.,1665857911,isg08ln,t3_y4qz85,t3_y4qz85,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
imagineFestivalMaybe,"Well, I will just copy paste the comment I made in the notorious nootropics sub:  


Nonetheless, I have no experience with alcohol whatsoever, but know that theanine is an agonist at the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor. These ""metabotropic"" compared to ""ionotropic"" receptors can have long lasting effects well after the initial signal is connected. In general, l-theanine has had very different effects on me depending on my biological state and what else is in my system. In college, on a typical American diet, it made me feel more aware if I used it for sleep. I could still fall asleep, but it felt more stimulating like taurine, which was too dopaminergic and euphoria and motivation inducing to use for sleep. But within the same year, one time in college, during midterms, after using stimulants (the strongest being just 3mg doses ephedrine, nothing like most people here) for a few days so that I only had to sleep 2-4 hours a night, I took taurine like 1-3g to try and sleep for 3 hours, and was blown away by the fact it gave me the ""spins"" while laying in bed. I was unable to hit typical REM sleep, but was in a deep trance feeling like my whole body was in an ocean swirling around because how sensitive my body had become to the GABA type effects, I suppose. Many years later on a keto diet, taurine is very sedating compared to before, but still gives enough motivation so that I would not use it to sleep. Theanine, used to be very potent on a typical carb adapted body, but now is very lackluster, but maybe I need to experiment with it more. Generally it just made me physically tired, and visually everything looked less awesome, and mentally less drive, on a keto diet.  


Maybe think it like the mGlur5 is very much a modulating receptor, so your glutamate will function within certain bounderies. So if you take it alone, you might not notice anything, but if under extreme stress or with stimulates, sedatives, hallucinogens, the effect will be very obvious.",1668892160,ix0q14r,t3_y4qz85,t3_y4qz85,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
newtoreddit732,Hmm I haven't looked too much into Taurine but I've heard mostly positive things about it. Is Taurine on it's own stimulating or calming?,1665858691,isg2301,t3_y4qz85,t1_isg09vi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

PhantomZero77,"Generally more calming, taurine works by inhibiting GABA transaminase, which is what breaks down GABA. So essentially it allows more GABA to stay in your brain longer by blocking its uptake.",1665903022,isik5ih,t3_y4qz85,t1_isg2301,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Alasdaire,"As the saying goes, there really aren't many free lunches. Which is precisely why theanine stands out.

Just to be clear, by free lunch, I mean that there are noticeable benefits, the substance is generally well-tolerated and has a good safety profile, little tolerance is built, and you're not adversely affecting other bodily processes. That's a tall task.

If you begin to experiment with nootropics, you'll likely realize that you don't respond to many substances in the first place. Or at least, you don't notice any benefit. And then even for those that you do benefit from and/or notice, they often come at a cost of toxicity, tolerance, or collateral damage to some other part of the body. So even if you find something that works for you, make sure to look into the possible negative effects. For instance, you might enjoy the cortisol-lowering effect that Ashwagandha has, but you might unwittingly be messing with your thyroid and not realize that until you get goiter.

If you're deficient in any vitamin/mineral, getting a sufficient amount is a free lunch. Magnesium, for example, has noticeable effects for some people, and its safety profile is great.",1665864382,isgff9a,t3_y4qz85,t1_isg68te,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
