I purchased a bottle of Jarrow L-Theanine and have not opened it yet, I've had it sitting around for awhile. I've been lurking this subreddit for a few days and it's a lot more realistic (just what I was looking for) and less bullshitty than r/nootropics (which tends to have a lot of users that cope with borderline scams that don't even work). So  things like L-Theanine seem like they're a meme in here. I'd like to know from some genuine nootropic or drug nerds in here if L-Theanine is a meme and I should return the bottle instead of opening it or if it's decent. The effects I'd mostly be looking for out of it are calming effects and some enhanced focus without too many bs side effects or a catch to it that makes it not worth it to use. Thanks a lot for any help.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Is L-Theanine Cope?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/y4qz85/is_ltheanine_cope/
