Alhakawati,"AlCAR and DHA 500, exercising allot, both running and strength training,  living in accordance with your circadian rhythm, plenty of sunlight, healthy diet, socialising, competitive sport, not many substances but getting the basics right will help you in the short and long run.

Also completing simple tasks, like cleaning and washing dishes will improve your dopamine circuitry.
If you feel underestimated look at what needs to be done or fixed in your immediate environment, this will stimulate both dopamine circuitry and serotonin by executing a task and being satisfied with the improvement. 


The most important step is not the first one, but the next one, keep that in mind and stay committed. 

Other substances you can take would be Bromantane, Jiaogulan, Yerba mate, also can try agmatine sulfate.",1666563285,itikbde,t3_yb9rrx,t3_yb9rrx,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Zdog54,"When I stopped taking my Adderall I felt like absolute shit. Upregulating my dopamine receptors helped a lot. [upregulating dopamine](https://www.theoptimizingblog.com/repair-dopamine-receptors/)

Personally I used the Mr happy stack which is uridine, DHA and a choline source but I didn't like how choline made me feel so I just used the other two. Also 12 grams inositol, cordyceps, acetyl l carnitine and sulbutamine will all upregulate dopamine receptors.

Also maybe look into cerebrolysin, very powerful stuff",1666542236,ith1kjs,t3_yb9rrx,t3_yb9rrx,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
xMicro,"NMDA antagonists are notorious for inducing indifference. What I’m assuming to what people are referring to are the “after” effects of things like ketamine where you have enhanced LTP in the prefrontal cortex (more plasticity) and enhancement of glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, while *on* on an NMDA antagonist, you will be calmer, but more indifferent to things. So I don’t thing it’s etiologically good for anhedonia (again, unless you’re interested in the after period, but that doesn’t always last forever). 

Tianeptine at therapeutic doses is good for reversing anhedonia (which is heavily related to mu opioid signaling, not dopamine signaling), as well as avolition. Low doses of different stimulants (like modafinil, or racetams) can be useful too.",1666719161,itqy3v1,t3_yb9rrx,t3_yb9rrx,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

xMicro,"Probably, yes. Look up “memantine brain fog Reddit” and you’ll see a lot of discussion about it. It’s interesting because we have sarcosine and D-serine, which act as agonists (indirect and direct, respectively) at the glycine site of NMDA receptors, which mean they’re the functional opposites of NMDA antagonist. And these might cause irritable (less indifferent/foggy), nootropic, and anti-psychotic effects, essentially the opposite of NMDA antagonists.",1666880251,itzpfxs,t3_yb9rrx,t1_itzouw7,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Barkoook,"So if memantine's nootropic effects are caused by upregulation of nmda receptors due to antagonism, does this mean there will be downregulation with agonists like d-serine in long term and possibly cognitive worsening?

neuro__atypical,"Are you thinking of prions? Prions are impossible, a bad reaction to IN administration is not. I believe IN administration means everything in Cerebrolysin can enter the brain directly without having to cross the BBB first. That could theoretically cause issues. IIRC he had brain inflammation or something that caused a hospital stay and severe disability.

Could have been a bad batch or other issues. But still, it's only designed for injection. There was also another guy on longecity I don't remember who had issues with IN.",1666545600,ith9wef,t3_yb9rrx,t1_ith9kpg,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
xMicro,"Memantine’s nootropic effects are largely isolated to the subset of the population with dementia and drug-induced cognitive impairment (like scopolamine). From what I’ve seen there’s little actual indication that memantine is nootropic in healthy humans. If anything, it seems to be anti-nootropic. 

There is of course a concern with receptor downregulation or desensitization, but memantine has a much more pronounced effect on the magnitude of change in NMDA activity than sarcosine does, so I’d anticipate it’d be less of a concern with sarcosine than memantine. Would need to be researched though

It all depends on the relative dose used. Amantadine also hits other targets memantine doesn’t. Plus they both have many targets outside of NMDA. So it’s hard to say.",1666892264,iu0k3sx,t3_yb9rrx,t1_iu0i9ty,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
