You will find yourself stuck in a drunk mode where you can't function properly for a 12+ hour mark.  
What do you take to stop that when you REALLY need to get things done? Caffeine sometimes will exacerbate & make things worse, turning you into a hyper non-functioning drunk that cannot sleep nor focus.

Is there a nootropic that somehow sobers you up?   
Please don't be like the jerks in the phenibut sub, *I posted this there once and they cried about how it's ppl like me who will get this stuff banned (my dose is less than 1.5 grams btw)*  
*- Benadryl is not an option*  
*- Moda & Racetams (choline sources too) will normally intensify phenibut's effects & action.*  
*- Piracetam works a bit but seeking something better*",False,t5_4aoxhu,Nootropics to combat/reverse Phenibut's drunkenness?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/u1hiu6/nootropics_to_combatreverse_phenibuts_drunkenness/
