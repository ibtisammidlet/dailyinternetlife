sirsadalot,Have you ever tried not taking phenibut?,1649711132,i4cc5cm,t3_u1hiu6,t3_u1hiu6,11,False,t5_4aoxhu
lennartblaauw,"If your question is how to sober up?
Stop taking phenibut
However you can experiment with different stimulants to 'counteract' the drunk effect. 
Caffeine was too stimulating? Sabroxy might be a option it is quite new although you should look to its profile. 
Why are you taking phenibut first place? Is it for a high or is it to have fun or just to combat anxiety symptoms?",1649746407,i4ec6qp,t3_u1hiu6,t3_u1hiu6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
viceman256,"I'm with you. Even 250mg now makes me feel so bad. I simply used to use it for its social anxiety benefits. I used to be able to take 500mg to 1g and navigate social encounters better than I ever could naturally. Verbal fluidity, insecurity, sensitivity, all improved. In that sense it was a nootropic for me, by reducing my anxiety and sensitivity it allows me to think and speak much more clearer and naturally. 

I wish I found a way to combat the fatigue and intoxication from 250 - 500mg. But at this point I can't risk having a day or two of feeling bad to test stacks. I'll have to wait for a long weekend or when my contracts are up. I hope people post some stacks they found useful for countering the fatigue and balancing its anxiolytic effects.",1649782692,i4g7xw2,t3_u1hiu6,t3_u1hiu6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
3ric843,"I personally have never been unable to function properly because of Phenibut, even when taking 1.5 gram at once.

But I guess if it were to happen, phenylpiracetam would be pretty sobering.

I don't care what you think, if you take more than 250 mg of phenibut at once, and more than 750 mg in a day, you are abusing it and looking for trouble (and obviously your cognition will suffer)

If you wanna use phenibut as a nootropic, you shouldn't take more than 50 mg (I'm not even sure of that, but that's what another redditor told me, that nootropic effects are achieved with low doses of 25-50 mg. Haven't tested it). 250 mg is an anxiolytic dose and any more than that is recreational. And phenibut is not a good substance to use recreationally. Even once every 1-2 weeks leads to horrible rebounds in the majority of people after a while. Took a few months for me. Now I can't do it anymore, it makes me anxious, and then gives me a horrible rebound about 2 days after, which lasts for 24-48 hours.

Kava is much better than phenibut and doesn't cause rebounds, dependence or tolerance.",1649770571,i4fcuz3,t3_u1hiu6,t3_u1hiu6,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu

rw3a,"It's not, mostly between 750-1200... I take it for business meetings and work events for social purposes.

Also, I'm not sure why people respond negatively to this question, I thought Reddit was a good place to ask questions and get answers/anecdotes, which I need right now to figure this out, especially when taken early in the day for a quick 10 AM meeting, then need to put in some work around 3 pm.

Again, this doesn't always happen... Sometimes it works perfectly for its purpose without affecting the rest of my day, but other times something needs to be fixed.

I did not intend to bother, nor cause any unwanted energy... I am just curious. Actually, I respect what you're doing and thought this sub was about discussing Nootropic Topics freely, as in sharing studies/findings also anecdotal information without prejudice.

I just searched and came up with these?  If you could kill Phenibut it could have wider implications. Definitely interesting. To wit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792056/
