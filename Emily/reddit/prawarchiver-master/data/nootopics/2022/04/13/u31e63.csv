xMicro,"What's a ""supplement"" to you? Calcium carbonate isn't really a supplement. I'll list some drugs too.

Vitamin C as an acid does not appreciably affect pH to interfere with amphetamine, but some bases like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate may.

Semax, ALCAR, caffeine, theacrine, IDRA-21, nicotine, PPAP, bromantane, racetams, zinc, pramipexole,  etc. will potentiate.

Lithium, NAC, modafinil, opioids (kratom, tianeptine), etc. will dull it.

As always, research things thoroughly before trying them.",1649909066,i4nrkmu,t3_u31e63,t3_u31e63,7,False,t5_4aoxhu
roof_lurker,Doesnâ€™t really make sense to me the Agmatine will reduce the effects while L-arginine will potentiate. Agmatine is decarboxylated L-Arginine,1649958612,i4q827l,t3_u31e63,t3_u31e63,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Delicious_Unit9998,"This is a personal experience with no actual research to back it up so take it more as a ""U never know"".
I'm on a different kind of stimulant but really, they all act very similarly so its almost the same and I did some experiments and apparently it's general to any kind of stimulant.
I've previously experienced some really awful side effects when mixing stimulants with supplements containing: ALCAR, Bacopa Moneri, Lion's Mane shroom and/or Choline. 
I've experienced a lot of fucked up things when mixing substances but nothing like this, the main two ingredients that I suspect cause this reaction are Lion's Mane shroom and ALCAR; they definitely boost the stimulants effects but in a really weird way, it has a very nasty feeling to it
Most commonly experienced symptoms were: rapid heartbeat, confusion, agitagion, excessive sweating, uneasiness, dry mouth, difficulty breathing, gross and fine motor abilities impaired, paranoia, impaired cognition, very mild visual disturbances, parasthesia, numbness in my extremities, and some really weird feeling in my head whenever I drank water, it was like a ""dull tingling sensation"" I guess (?). 

Anyway, that happened to me with coffee, modafinil, concerta (64mg), and desoxyephedrine (pharmaceutical)",1650083394,i4x6dze,t3_u31e63,t3_u31e63,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

lowkeyf1sh,once agmatine is made from arginine it does the opposite by resetting NMDA receptors,1650163260,i51b03g,t3_u31e63,t1_i4q827l,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
