Jazzlike_Fan232,"Honestly the best way itâ€™s shake it well, have it spray more effective that way. Take a nice big sniff with one nostril closed, same with the other side. and just keep sniffing couple times after. I feel it right away after barely if any comes out very little sometimes. Keep doing this depending how hard you need to sniff each nostril one at a time whenever you use it to not come out. Always sniff a couple times to ensure it doesnâ€™t come out. Just experiment how hard you breath it in and how long.",1649216352,i3kz7qy,t3_tx51i1,t3_tx51i1,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
cinciallegra,"Hallo maybe this can help: I stumbled upon a nice shrt video form a doctor on YT that explains how to use nasal sprays . I am following his advise now every time I use any type of nasal spray: DR gregory Abbass: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnEre7FHUAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnEre7FHUAQ)  

he tells  how to position your head, with which hand you should spray, and the direction you should spray towards (ie at which angle in your nostril).",1649196615,i3jrl2r,t3_tx51i1,t3_tx51i1,10,False,t5_4aoxhu

Anxious-Medicine-133,"Best way: On YouTube >  > Search: How to use a nasal spray. The 2 easiest videos are > Dr. Gregory Abbas and NEMERA. The main thing to remember is - Don't sniff hard, just gently smell with the other nostril closed.  I keep a cotton ball to catch any drips and then sniff the cotton ball.
BTW: Is it okay to use the liquid Bromantane sublingually? I don't want to try if it's not okay to swallow some. Thanks fellow Bro's!ðŸ¤—",1663080586,io9j100,t3_tx51i1,t3_tx51i1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"Thanks for your advise on this! And just so I am clear in my understanding of the process, is this right:

1. After shaking spray one nostril.

2. Then take a big sniff with that nostril with the other nostril closed.

3. Repeat 1 & 2 on the other nostril.

4. Always sniffing a couple of times on each side.

Is that right?",1649256962,i3msru8,t3_tx51i1,t1_i3kz7qy,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

LieWorldly4492,"That's odd. I once did a course of the Russian pharmaceutical pills and there was an almost immediate subjective benefit.  


50-100mg . The pills are dosed a lot higher, I think the sprays have like 7mg for a dose? Has anyone had both? I curious if it crossed the BBB better IN and has more of a regenerative effect on the brain and less of a slight performance enhancing effect on the body.  


I like that it's very easy on the body and doesn't dangerously interact with other medications that work on neurotransmitters, At worst they will compete for some of the same receptors, Maybe an irreversable MAO Inhibitor could still be risky, but I haven't seem it come up in any of the literature I  read back then.",1703325786,kel5ezf,t3_tx51i1,t1_if81n62,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
