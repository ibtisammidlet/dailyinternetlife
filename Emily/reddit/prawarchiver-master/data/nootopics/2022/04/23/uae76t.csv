The-Swiss-Chad,"1. Is that on the right side your workout?
2. Impressive that you manage to eat over 3000 kcal I think I have a hard time even reaching 1.5k.
3. Mechanism or reason why you use Sceletium, 7,8 DHF, loratidine?
4. Increase your melatonin Dosage :)",1650795502,i5zgtyq,t3_uae76t,t3_uae76t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"This is what I thought. I think he is betting on 52g ALA to counterbalance that 52g n-6.   
I would still get Omega-3 index done (n-3/n-6 ratio) to be sure.",1650767187,i5ybrqk,t3_uae76t,t1_i5y40qu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"1. Yes, I haven't done it a few months tho  

2. it took a while to build that up, esp considering it's all relatively low calorie and high fiber.  

3. Sceletium is my serotonergic of choice because it's the only thing I found that upregulates VMAT2 selective to serotonin neurons. The benefits of this are far too broad to list in a single comment. Older post explaining it below. Let's just say it's both very neuroprotective and euphoriant. 7,8 DHF is a TrkB agonist, simple. Loratidine is there to counteract the peripheral side effects of low dose Modafinil. I'll retry the Moda and if it's unbearable again I'll add loratidine.

,Yeah nah man it's not a problem. People demonize omega 6 but it's as useful as omega 3. Problem is most people consume too little ALA.,1650788080,i5z80un,t3_uae76t,t1_i5ybrqk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,"3. DHF and sceletium are not orally bioavailable? Considerd making them IN?

4. Sorry thought you had 150mcg. 150mg is def a good dosage. Question is from where did you get so much xD",1650806613,i5zxcfo,t3_uae76t,t1_i5zjjiv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

The-Swiss-Chad,"Yeah I do, Im just hyperfocused on other things throughout the day, that I just don't eat. So I eat maybe 2 meals a day (unintentionally). My hunger is also not so high",1650973236,i694wfg,t3_uae76t,t1_i60kkcb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"3. I do subL for both. It works well. You can see in my picture, on the cards at the top, the supplementation is divided by time of intake and route of administration.  


4. I'm gonna order PureBulk.",1650811746,i608ds5,t3_uae76t,t1_i5zxcfo,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,Tried a few source up until now. I was lucky as all of them were potent. First two batches were from an unknown German vendor my friend found for me. I was unable to find it later. Now I use the [Science.bio](https://Science.bio) extract but they're closed now. I plan to use Liftmode after this and hopefully after that I'll have enough of my own plant :),1650923811,i66qq8s,t3_uae76t,t1_i65yzq9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
