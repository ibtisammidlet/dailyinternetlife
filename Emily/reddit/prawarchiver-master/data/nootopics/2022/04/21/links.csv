For the first month I felt like I was 18 again now my results have settled back down closer to baseline (still improved though) and Iâ€™m kind of wanting to get that level back if possible

For clarity I also take ALCAR at 1g and cordyceps militaris at .75g-1g daily on top of pycnogenol and ubiquinol (later two for general health)

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane spray dose range?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/u8otur/bromantane_spray_dose_range/
