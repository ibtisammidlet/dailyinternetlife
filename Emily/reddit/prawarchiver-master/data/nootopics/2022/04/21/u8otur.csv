,"I have had the same experience, for the first week or 2 it was amazing, the stimulation plus mental and physical endurance were great. After that the effects dropped off a lot I still feel the physical endurance effects but the mental focus/anti-anxiety effects are transitory and depend on the day. I might just be retarded and not able to keep the spray in my nostrils long enough for it to be absorbed. I am still trying to figure that out

I recently went up to 3/4 sprays a day and that has seemed to improved the effects alot seems like some sort of tolerance even if its not the technical tolerance that sirsadalot says doesnt happen with Bromantane",1650556789,i5mqj7q,t3_u8otur,t3_u8otur,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
vintage2789,"I’ll try 3 sprays see if that gives the desired effect

I do agree although technically no tolerance is built the body seems to want to return to baseline one way or the other so consistent use may garner the same gross result chemically but not the same net result. 

I mean honestly if I knew I could use a 2 spray baseline and 3 on an “as needed” basis for cognitive/mood boosting I’m more than fine with that. 

Thank you for your input",1650561574,i5n2vyv,t3_u8otur,t1_i5mqj7q,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
