I know that this happens because the mechanism of action of caffeine is different from most CNS stimulants and this is something normal. However I hate the idea of depending on a substance, so, what nootropics would be good to help quitting caffeine? L-Theanine is not an option because it has interactions with modafinil and it can inhibit it's proper absorption. 


PS: I know that mixing so many stimulants is inadequate and dangerous in most cases but I have a fairly high tolerance to them, amongst other things that my doctor considered before prescribing them and allowing me to keep drinking coffee, so, no need to concern about it",False,t5_4aoxhu,Â¿Substitutes for caffeine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/u4q4ap/substitutes_for_caffeine/
Specific-Maybe,1650026928,self.NooTopics,u47bc3,True,6,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/u47bc3/glycinedserine_excitotoxicity/,1709901578,5,"Okay guys I'm extremely confused about glutamate induced excitotoxicity. So we know that high levels of glutamate in the brain cause excitotoxicity. The most relevant receptor is NMDA, and glycine/d-serine are co-agonists on that receptor site and are needed in order for it to fire. So I don't understand how glycine/d-serine can be neuroprotective when they're literally needed for glutamate receptors to be activated. I want to clarify that I'm not trying to insinuate that glycine/d-serine are neurotoxic (actually I hope they're not), so that's why I want to clearly understand the mechanisms through which they work in the brain.
