andalusian293,"I'm wondering this as well, though it looks like glycine might be somewhat protective and/or relaxing by being used to make glutathione.",1650050777,i4vas01,t3_u47bc3,t3_u47bc3,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
andalusian293,"Fwiw I just tried sarcosine and D-serine together today ... Pleasantly stimulating, wrecked cognition for me.

But I also have a pretty bad mental health history and am on a neuroleptic that ruins everything.",1650063444,i4w2x6s,t3_u47bc3,t3_u47bc3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Khronosgod,Glycine acts as a stimulant in the brain so it might cause excitotoxicity if you have too much in your brain. while d-serine betters the absorption of glutamate and that's how it avoids rxcess in glutamate,1650080277,i4x0x66,t3_u47bc3,t3_u47bc3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,"Sirsadalot is probably better at answering this question, but if I understand the NMDA system correctly it's all about balance. It dosen't work as well as just increase this and you get this. It's delicate so there will be conflicting results. On the one hand to much glutamate signaling will be excitotoxic like you say, however to little will also be toxic to the brain while slightly elevating NMDA neurotransmission above baseline will most likely be neuroprotective because this will downstream activate ampa receptors and cause LTP which is induced by growth factors (neuroprotection). This is also one of the reasons imo why the NMDA system is very delicate and on the one hand you can easily overdue it with NMDA signaling on and cause excitotoxicity and on the other hand you might miss the potential benefits in cognition when you abstain from it. So if you do decide to raise NMDA signaling which is very important for LTP an concurrently synaptic plasticity (learning and memory) I highly recommend using one of the two developed approaches to protect your brain from potential excitotoxicity while raising NMDA signaling. 1. Free Radical scavengers (Anti-oxidant and ideally Anti-nitrogen species compounds) my personal favorite is CBD. or 2. A NMDA antagonist ideally extrasynaptic to not minimise LTP.   
Hope this makes sense. This is as much as I understand.",1650216824,i53su5e,t3_u47bc3,t3_u47bc3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Specific-Maybe,"Well since glutathione is a tripeptide made from glutamate, glycine and cysteine, glycine does offer protection in terms of oxidative stress especially when paired with NAC. There is a really nice study showing this but oxidative stress and excitotoxicity are different things so I'm more interested in that particular aspect.",1650063358,i4w2qpu,t3_u47bc3,t1_i4vas01,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Cantbelievewerehere,Thank you for this rundown. Would agmatine work as an NMDA antagonist here?,1679085203,jcm2ntx,t3_u47bc3,t1_i53su5e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
