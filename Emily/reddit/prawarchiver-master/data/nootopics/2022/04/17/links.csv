It's a lab test. My dumb ass thought cyclazadone would not show up and was legal for me to take. I did not realize that pemoline shows up on tests, with cyclazadone being a derivative of pemoline. After some minor research it seems pemoline causes false positives for amphetamines on drug tests and I assumed cyclazadone would too, although two threads on reddit say otherwise.

Does anyone have experience in taking a drug test after taking cyclazadone?

In the lab test process would they even have false positives or is everything gc/ms tested?

I have no problem in not taking it, but I just found out today I have to test tomorrow and I had taken it yesterday. Im probably fine regardless but would like to be more comfortable in my decision than I am currently. Hopefully I didn't fuck up.

Edit: Passed the test. HOWEVER, this could be due to dosage or because the test was 48hrs after administration. Please don't use this answer conclusively if you're coming from google. I intend to take my own test with it 100% in my system soon.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Cyclazadone as amphetamine on Urinalysis?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/u5swb3/cyclazadone_as_amphetamine_on_urinalysis/
