Any reason to think alternating bromantane usage may have some tolerance, safety, or efficacy benefits? I was thinking maybe through the immediate early gene effect of bromantane. Obviously there could be other mechanisms by which there may be some potential benefit.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane and Amphetamine,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/tw94ee/bromantane_and_amphetamine/

This picture showcases the difference this simple device can make:

The idea is to use airflow from the mouth to push nasal mist upwards through the nasal cavity, with part of the benefit stemming from the fact airflow expands the nasal cavity, particularly the nasal valve. The company Optinose is built around commercializing this idea, but it's not really anything new - the Kuripe relies on the same principle and has been around for centuries.

Our implementation of this can be the Snoot nasal spray bottle (available on Amazon for $16/2) with a 3D printed enclosure. The enclosure is to route air from the mouth to a nosepiece that surrounds the out nasal spray's output nozzle, while also holding the nasal spray bottle steady.

I take two 144mg capsules at different times of the day separately. I am assuming there must be some underlying reason why some people have pretty severe gastrointestinal reactions to even moderate doses of magnesium (in any form). Since I receive a noticeable mental/psychological benefit form magnesium and wish to continue taking it, I am searching for potential nutrient interactions, imbalances, or other biological explanations  that could play a role in gastrointestinal magnesium intolerance. Any (even hypothetical) thoughts are appreciated.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Magnesium Threonate Gastrointestinal Side Effects,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/tvitwo/magnesium_threonate_gastrointestinal_side_effects/
