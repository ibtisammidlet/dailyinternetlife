infrareddit-1,"Sorry to hear of your difficulties. I suspect there are people out there who have developed hard dependencies because they love themselves on stims. You will be glad you made this decision. And I suspect youâ€™ll find other helpful strategies. 

One to consider is anxiolytics. Kava is safe and effective:   https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00048674.2010.522554",1650842288,i628muk,t3_ub6e3z,t3_ub6e3z,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

viceman256,"As someone with lifelong social anxiety, I know how you feel. I was on the coke/addy/Ritalin/etc phase for too long. The social shame rebound is real. For those symptoms in particular, I have found supplements that increase testosterone are key, additionally I add non-addictive energy drugs.

For increasing T, I take tongkat, cistanche, shilajit, and occasionally take cordyceps for a couple weeks at a time. Energy boosting supplements include bromantane and NMN/NR, plus shilajit and cordyceps work for that too slightly.

I first noticed the social anxiety reduction with shilajit, then moved into the others once my tolerance grew quickly, but still lacked a desire to socialize. Bromantane and NMN/NR resolve that for sure. Bromantane increases my desire for socialization, and with NMN/NR I never run out of social energy or ruminate.

My two cents if you're looking for alternatives to traditional stimulants. If that's too much for now, at the very least I recommend purchasing NAC and agmatine sulfate to reduce symptoms like rumination and overthinking.",1651897903,i7n4hx0,t3_ub6e3z,t3_ub6e3z,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"Sounds familiar. I experienced similar symptoms also when I used benzos. I have no stimulant history other than caffeine and MDMA. Caffeine helps like an hour when dosage is right. MDMA did nothing, all I felt was more enjoyment of music.

SSRIs are helpful with these shame issues after socializing. Annoying part is you don't feel much positive emotions either.

Phenelzine is likely the best helper with SA for most people. Just impossible to get where I live.",1654064116,iar9khf,t3_ub6e3z,t3_ub6e3z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

dmt267,"Definitely my experience as well,to the point of even being over talkative at times to mask anxiety when I was anxious. But nowadays I feel way more at ease and find myself taking less caffeine and stimulants,imo Apigenin is really the main thing helping in that regard",1651007492,i6bge5j,t3_ub6e3z,t3_ub6e3z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"I also smoked a lot of weed as a teen and have social anxiety. 

Stimulants can make socializing easier, but I feel like it puts me on another wavelength than other people so I'm less charismatic / likable. I prefer alcohol as my drug of choice for social lubrication.",1651777946,i7gn2v5,t3_ub6e3z,t3_ub6e3z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
