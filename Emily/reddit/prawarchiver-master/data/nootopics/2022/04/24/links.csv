I don't know if this is allowed to post here .This is just my experience as a person who suffers from social anxiety all their lives, and I decided to share it in case anyone else suffers from it too. I suffer from social anxiety all my life, I used a lot of marijuana in my adolescence, today I am 25 years old. About 3 years ago I discovered that dopaminergics (Any Stimulant) make my social anxiety practically disappear. I get extremely outgoing and speak whatever I think without fear, build confidence, enjoy socializing, go out in search of conversations, literally as if I had no social anxiety.

This made me start using cocaine, ritalin, mdma, (coffee doesn't have much effect on me because I have ADHD), but when I'm under some stimulation I feel like a normal person in the socializing part. The problem is that when everything passes, I regret every word I said to each person, it makes comedowns extremely psychologically painful.

Everything I said in a night or afternoon while I was stimulated comes back to my head with something I shouldn't have said, sounded stupid, etc. (Social anxiety). So I decided that as much as I become the person I would like to be when I'm under some stimulus, it's not worth it because of the thoughts I have afterward when everything passes.

I've actually been suicidal for thinking too much about the things I've said to people. Anyway, this is just my anecdotal story, in case anyone else feels that way, I would love to know. thank you so much for reading",False,t5_4aoxhu,A person with social anxiety who uses a stimulant is the perfect key to heightened anxiety and depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/ub6e3z/a_person_with_social_anxiety_who_uses_a_stimulant/
