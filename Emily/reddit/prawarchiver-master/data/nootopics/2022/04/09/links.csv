As someone with both ADHD and arthritis, it definitely caught my attention. I have noticed that Adderall seems to help with joint pain and physical exhaustion of my limbs acutely, but over time the pain has gotten worse. If amph acutely increases TyrH (maybe? not sure about this one but it's possible I guess?) but chronically downregulates it, this could make some sense. 

&#x200B;

Was curious how common having ADHD and arthritis was, and if anyone has noticed a benefit to joints with dopaminergic compounds, specifically ones that upregulate TyrH like bromantane? Also, are there any other potential TyrH upregulators out there, especially ones that are more easily accessible than bro?
