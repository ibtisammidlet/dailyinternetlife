Key thing here is to lower neuro-inflammation which high-dose-melatonin does very well.

LDN (Low-Dose-Naltrexone) does a even better job alleviating neuro-inflammation and has much longer half-live then         melatonin.

\- Nattokinase (2000FU 2-3x per day) in concert with Serrapeptase (40k 2-3x per day) --> blod clot buster supplements

/////////WARNING:////////////

plz be careful with natto+serra!!!  Start with 2000FU natto + 40k serra once every 2-3 days then after 1-2 week     increase to once every 1-2 days till your reach   2000FU Natto + 40k Serra  2-3x per day. If you feel weird sensation     in your head / weird headache stop immediately and lower dose/enlarge time window between doses!! If you take to much to fast blood clots will dislodge, traveling through your arteries and can be very detrimental to your health!!

\- Antihistamine:  Famotidine + Loratidin  (proven by many LongCovid patients as beeing very effective alleviating brainfog etc.)

\- Piracetam+CDP Choline: Piracetam has same anti-platelet properties as aspirin has + it makes the red blood cells more dynamic/squishy...this property has been lost as it was demonstrated in multiple papers that red blood cells in LongCovid patients seem to be stiff/clumpy.

\- Ginko Bilboa or Vinpocetine:  both enhance cerebral bloodflow which got disrupted in LongCovid-patients.

So I'm just wondering if anyone happens to know if there are any ways to get more for my money beyond the typical oral ROA. 

From what I read, you can use the freebase sublingually or intranasal but would that also work with the HBr? Has anyone tried that and how did it go if so? I know that bemethyl's effects are supposed to be build up and last for a while after dosing, which is nice. However, I still would love to hear any tips or tricks on making bemethyl stronger given its cost per dose.
