Volcanyx,"So as far as I have figured out when I looked into this was that you CAN get liposome layers to form on candidates, but the thickness of that layer will determine how well it can be delivered to the gut. If the layer is not thick enough then the drug that is encased can be destroyed in the stomach, and if it is too thick then the layer will prevent being digested in the gut and you will end up excreting it and the lipid layer whole. I looked into lab equipment that can very precisely create nanodrug delivery with very precise control over lipid layer encasing. However, this equipment is very friggin expensive. 

Youd be looking at an investment that is so expensive that it would be very hard to justify doing it for personal reasons, and then when you consider commercial purposes, youd have to heavily invest in a dedicated lab space in order to get the certifications you would want to have for selling the products you make. 

I wonder if there is a way to work out formulas based off molecular weight, granule size, amount, size of lipid particles, etc, so that one could get around the need for such precise lab equipment. One method that is brought up a lot is sonication. It is possible that you would end up with some of the drug encased in too thick of a layer and then another amount in too thin, there could be a range of varying thicknesses etc. This may not be that bad though, provided the formula you come up with is somewhat reliable for a certain percentage. 

The cost of the equipment for repeatedly exacting results is so high that one could forgive a pretty large amount of out of range end product.",1650222908,i547b9u,t3_u5rkgl,t3_u5rkgl,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
The-Swiss-Chad,"**Thanks for the detailed comment.**

Even if the layer is to thin or too thick you can also just change the ROA to IN or transdermal (and other).

There the liposomal solution would be advantages ether way no? (wether it is more thick or thin)?

Also in the video mentioned they prepared a liposomal mix, where you can just use that and mix it with your compound which ether is water or lipid based. What do you think of that excluding the issues you mentioned for oral absorption **(presumably for transdermal or other ROA).** In that case it might be an easy cost applicable solution?

I also think **EVEN** if the layer will be too thin it presumably will still improve oral bioavailability to **some** extent in comparison to using the compound normally. No?",1650224972,i54c39k,t3_u5rkgl,t1_i547b9u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
