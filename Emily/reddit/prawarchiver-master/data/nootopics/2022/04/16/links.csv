**Swiss chad here.**

 I have lately been looking into different compounds and I think we all come across the same issue often times which usually goes along the line of it's **oral bioavailability is bad or we don't know it's actual bioavailability**. Usually this can just be **circumvented by changing the ROA** which many of us already know.

**However,** I want to argue that we can increase the bioavailability of compounds even further by easily making them into **Liposomal solutions** and thereby potentially **not need to change the ROA or improve the selected ROA's bioavailability further.**

After I quick search I found this: (**Explanation of how to make your own liposomal solution**)

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfnWwjCtdyQ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfnWwjCtdyQ)

They also talk about ether having a lipid based solution or a water based solution. Ether way it dosen't matter since as I outlined in this post [**https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teqhku/easily\_asses\_compound\_solubility\_for\_in/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teqhku/easily_asses_compound_solubility_for_in/)

You can simply use that tool to find the solubility of the compound you are trying to use and thereby make it into a liposomal solution which then again can be used with your preferred ROA.

Questions/Concerns are welcome.

I began abusing substances when I was 14 y.o, starting with DXM and continuing on a path that consisted of only of OTC pharmaceutical substances, mainly to relief symptoms of my previously undiagnosed BPD, STPD and ADHD. It always seemed like a weird drug use pattern because most people start with alcohol or tobacco but it took me well over a year to get there, I was mostly using shit that for very good reasons, are not commonly abused such as Tryhexiphenidyl, which after some months of using caused me my first acute drug induced delirium and left me with PTSD and PPHD, after that I began using opioids and became addicted to them by the time I was 15, probably the shittiest years of my life but after experiencing 2 opioid withdrawals I decided to get clean, the problem was that physically I was fucked up and psychologicaly I was gone, also everything related to my cognition was completely fucked. I was so fucking slow, always tired, lazy, I had obesity, I regularly confused dreams and real memories, I couldn't walk 200 meters without being out of breath, sweating and I shit you not, with a 120 bpm, my emotional stability was inexistent just like my social life and my will to live. 

Until 2019, after a few months of heavy drinking and meth abuse I discovered the wonders of modafinil; It seems impossible and many clinical studies have concluded that it has no long term cognitive enhancements but for some reason it changed me and my life even after I stopped taking it, I got clean, started to take school kinda more seriously, began forming healthier relationships, I started going to the gym, for the first time in my life I read a fucking book, I began playing the piano and holy fuck, I think my memory had never been this sharp, I can remember most things in my life and for important or unimportant events, I can even recall exact dates for some of them, a year later I got prescribed with Concerta and I discovered the joys of having normal working cognitive executive functions, in the mean time I had also been in treatment with Piracetam, Citicholine, ALCAR, Propanolol, Avanzaten and a lot of nootropics that restored my brain. Now I'm in college, I'm also studying philosophy and pharmacology in my free time, I can totally focus, my reflexes are probably better than ever and for the first time I want to live while being as sober as I can be.

 
I'm not bragging tho, I'm still a fucking emotional wreck and Im still not doing well, phisically I'm still not in good shape and I have a lot of issues that are direct consequences of my own actions, but, the 180Â° changes to me and my life that began when I first took that little white pill is mind blowing to me. I'm 100% sure that I would have been long dead by now if I had never used modafinil, and began my nootropic journey, I mean, I know that I'm going to die and that it could be tomorrow or sometime later and I'm fine with it, but I would rather die being someone who is progressing and not the junkie I was a few years ago, I'm glad that I could apologize to the ones I hurt and began working on my redemption, even if it won't matter when I die, it matters now and I'm content with it as well as I'm grateful with nootropics for giving me the chance to live, and yes, I just thanked a bunch of chemicals",False,t5_4aoxhu,The story of how nootropics kinda saved my life,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/u4qn31/the_story_of_how_nootropics_kinda_saved_my_life/
