**Update:**

So as many of you know, our server has been snubbed yet again. But this time they actually took down NooTopics. So there's no denying discord's stance at this point. They do not like our community and what we've been doing.

There is hope, however. We are going to try and ""bridge"" matrix to discord so that we can intercommunicate between the two platforms. Discord is more user friendly and matrix will last longer. We need something to fall back on *and* we need something that feels natural.

And as always, we always have r/NooTopics. But reddit isn't a whole lot better than discord. So if you're like me and you want this to keep going, then please be open to alternative media. We are only going to be more discriminated against as time goes on.

**Other news:**

u/gintrux uses rocket chat for r/NootropicsFrontline, but we have opted to go a different route due to a need for a voice chat. At times NooTopics sustained 14+ members in voice chats.

Speaking of gintrux, I am collaborating with him. My website [https://bromantane.co](https://bromantane.co) hosts his Tabernanthalog, which is supposed to function as a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic of sorts, an ibogaine derivative.

In addition, I will receive more bromantane on monday which I am going to have tested and I should be back in stock soon. Pre-orders are enabled until then. SKQ1 will also be added to the site, a mitochondrial antioxidant. I also hope to collaborate with Bam and his website Wholistic Research, as well as all other upstanding vendors, who has novel nootropics and conducts adequate testing.",False,t5_4aoxhu,NooTopics discord DELETED | What's happening to this community?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/tzhgqm/nootopics_discord_deleted_whats_happening_to_this/

I started getting interested in nootropics when I noticed HOW much of a difference vyvanse does for me.

I have it for ADD but its the only med that helps with my depression as well!

I’ve tried everything except strong maoi’s and nothing helped until this!

However I only get like 5 hours of relief from my 70mg/day and I would rather find a more sustainable method than increasing the dosage.

My stack: Semax, uridine, TMG, l-theanine, a-gpc, noopept, aniracetam, forskolin, gym..

Could I add 9-mbc instead of vyvanse every other day? Would that seem like a good idea for my goal?

Thank you have a great weekend!",False,t5_4aoxhu,"9-me-bc, while on vyvanse(every other day?)",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/tzc69n/9mebc_while_on_vyvanseevery_other_day/
