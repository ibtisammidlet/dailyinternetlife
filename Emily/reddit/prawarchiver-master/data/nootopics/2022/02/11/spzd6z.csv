dragonology,"Day 1: 10:30am dosage following night of terrible sleep. I thought the day would be a write off, but the single spray kicked into full effects by around noon. I had an incredible day of motivation, confidence, intelligence and passion. Was shocked at how helpful this has been. The stimulation is offset by a calmness, entirely unique to any other stimulant I have ever taken.

It's 9pm now, and I am still stimulated. Only concern is sleep. I may have to save this only for very early morning usage, or ask if sirsadsalot would ever consider releasing a half strength spray.",1645765465,hycdzx0,t3_spzd6z,t3_spzd6z,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Personally I'd be leery of buying/using something like that (especially after viewing their very generic, and uninformative, website) without third party lab results provided.
