Qu3tza101c0at101,"I like it. Very clean wakefulness. Not edgy at all, and doesn't screw with my sleep. Also stacks nicely with agmatine.",1644481495,hwce0wn,t3_sp0uby,t3_sp0uby,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
jkybes,"I took it in May of 2021, but for a different reason than most people. My (stupid) plan was to work up to a super high dose (112mg twice a day) over a 2 week period and then stop cold turkey in an attempt to cause a long-lasting upregulation of the H3 receptor. I wanted this because I was experiencing brain over-excitation after certain triggers (bright artificial lights, conversations, doing cardio, certain foods, etc.) which was making it very hard to focus and retain information.

When I stopped taking it, those feelings of over-excitation were pretty much eliminated, but it also left me with symptoms that are worse than what I was experiencing before. Some of these are lack of wakefulness, lack of motivation, anhedonia, slowed thinking, increased dizziness, vivid dreams, more sweat, reduced motor control, difficulty going to bed and waking up early, and increased feeling of sickness. It's been by far the worst year and a half of my life. The increased sweating and feelings of sickness have pretty much faded away but the others still remain.

My doctor said that the receptors would have re-regulated by now but I'm not too sure about that. I think either the H3R are still upregulated, it caused dysregulation of other receptors, it caused a change in my microbiome/gene expression, or it messed with my blood flow to the brain. I got Covid 2 months after finishing the Betahistine so my doctor thinks that I developed long-Covid, which took those symptoms and prolonged them.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on what went wrong.",1663723839,ip9vgf2,t3_sp0uby,t3_sp0uby,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
mkdr,I am taking it since 2 weeks because of having Tinnitus and vertigo attacks. I am super irritable like no where before. I cant find anything about side effects that it could cause irritability. Anyone know something about it? It also seems to dramatically boost blood flow.,1673950110,j4phe2z,t3_sp0uby,t3_sp0uby,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Goodluckanon,"Wow, sounds good. How much is your dose?

I'm trying to fix my ruined sleep after seroquel. I'm free for 5 month for now and seroquel have mostly strong antihistamine action and other receptor action is much weaker. I've had big trouble with tapering down because insomnia won't go away. Insomnia is a main problem when you wan't to stop seroquel.
I have no insomnia before pills.

After some research, i've got betahistine and took 2 days for now. 8 mg. Under tongue and chewed.
After pill, i feel like i'm more awake and my mind is clear. Not like from stimulants, but like you awaken by bright light in the morning. And less tiredness feeling too. And widened blood vessels.

On seroquel withdrawal i felt in same manner, i was awaken all time and have trouble with sleep.
And i found, that another H3 antagonist is used in narcolepsy.

I hope, i get tolerance to this effect and will sleep better without betahistine. Because as i found, H1 receptors activity is very tied to sleep pattern.
Betahistine have nor- metabolite with H1 activity and H3 antagonism enhances histaminergic and excitory activity too.",1644600130,hwj19kt,t3_sp0uby,t1_hwce0wn,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
