I know that drugs like noopept (as an example) induce neuroplasticity/genesis which allows them to enhance learned behaviors. In a similar vein, addictive drugs like morphine increase BDNF at first but depress it long term (leading to addictive behaviors similar in effect to a learning disability). It seems logical to me, then, that neuroplasticity tends to encourage the establishment or enforcement of a homeostatic standard. Since drug tolerance may be looked at as a form of adjustment made by your body to maintain homeostasis, will neurotrophic and plasticity-inducing drugs enhance this process? I'm also interested in whether racetams are subsceptible to increasing tolerance due to NMDA/AMPA positive modulation or other actions.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Do BDNF/neuroplasticity inducers increase the development of tolerance to other drugs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/svo439/do_bdnfneuroplasticity_inducers_increase_the/
