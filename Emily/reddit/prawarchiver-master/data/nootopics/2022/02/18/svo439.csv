sirsadalot,"Neuroplasticity is a two-way street, so the answer to your question isn't so black and white. Both long term potentiation and long term depression are important in the fine tuning of synaptic connections. This process from afar can be observed as learning.

BDNF is ubiquitous and entirely region dependent in terms of its end results. Thus it is not inherently ""good"" (i.e. nucleus accumbens). What you may be conflating is the increase of it downstream from a tolerance-prone mechanism. The withdrawal of which actually could result in BDNF hypoexpression (i.e. Adderall withdrawal).

To elaborate even further, NMDA antagonists are notorious tolerance reversing drugs that basically work by generating AMPA currents which results in a lot of BDNF and mTOR. This is actually its antidepressant mechanism as well.

Drug addiction is somewhat of a learning disorder, albeit a manufactured one.",1645209124,hxh7ufb,t3_svo439,t3_svo439,13,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sohrey,"Can only give some anecdotes; noopept taken with amphetamine potentiated the amp desirable effects a fair amount for me when I first mixed them, however when taking amp the next day, all I got was a sugar pill effect and this persisted until i took a 14+ day break. 

I have met one other person who had this issue w noopept and amps. (both me and this friend have high functioning autism which I think may predispose one to increased tolerance to substance when taking with neurogenics.)

I also mixed cyclazodone with idra 21 once, and that 20 mg cyclaz had me get better acute effects from cyclaz than ever, however cyclaz was a sugar pill for 1 week after that so I obviously just said ok time for cyclaz break
But even after 2 weeks off, couldn't get good effects from cyclaz so im nearing thr end of this break, hopefully cyclaz works at 20mg again like it did when i first started it and hadn't mixed w idra 21.

Tldr: have experienced tolerance fuckery from amphetamine with noopept and if you've done the combo, please dm me your results amd your diagnosis (ideally!). I've also experienced tolerance fuckery from cyclazodone with idra 21 (idra isnt neurogenic is it.)

My question is; how come I only get the instant severe tolerance from mixing amphetamine and amphetamine like substances (cyclaz) with noopept or idra 21?(noopept and idra both strong ampakines too and I think the answer may lie there)

I should note I've taken a variety of neurogenics with a variety of drugs and haven't had a perceptible alteration in tolerance from doing so, but noopept w amphetamine or cyclazodone with idra 21 cuck me hard",1645370802,hxpmy4h,t3_svo439,t3_svo439,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

literalbrainlet,"I agree, I wish this post had been more successful. In my continued experimenting I've decided that noopept probably does fuck with tolerance accumulation. This is based on how it's affected weed, psychedelics, and stimulants for me (permanently blunting the visuals I experience on psychs) and other friends' anecdotes. No idea if this transfers to non-AMPAkine BDNF signalling/promoting drugs as glutamate could likely be involved in this phenomena.",1652113530,i7xq84h,t3_svo439,t1_i7wnm1y,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
