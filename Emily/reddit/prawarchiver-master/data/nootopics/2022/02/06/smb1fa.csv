I was getting this weird sensation in my left ear and sometimes right ear while taking higher doses, and I figured it was something hormonal in nature, as I had this issue start a while back when taking ashwagandha in large amounts.

Is it really that far reaching to think that shilajit can cause problems with the thyroid and iodine? Both of ash and shilajit increase testosterone. Here above we see a study linking shilajit to lower iodine levels, and many people claim to have thyroidal problems from ashwagandha. Might not be fear mongering, and who knows, maybe you are blindly giving a thumbs up to a potential danger. Better to err on the side of caution and supplement iodine if taking either, I would say. Besides, a lot of people are deficient.",1647799121,i1fhsgo,t3_smb1fa,t1_hx3dghx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
