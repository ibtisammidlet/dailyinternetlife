sirsadalot,"There are many studies demonstrating safety and nootropic potential in people, which is good. However I've seen no evidence that it has an after-effect like Bromantane (actually the opposite, tolerance). It increases spermatogenesis as well as sex drive initially, and then after 60 days it decreases both which points to a possible hormonal influence which could also play a role in its performance enhancing abilities.

Notably its antioxidant effect could make it an interesting alternative to other antioxidants due to its stimulating abilities, whereas many antioxidants are opposite in nature. This also makes it an interesting pair with D-Serine, which is nootropic but causes oxidative stress.

One Russian source claimed enhanced mRNA synthesis was responsible for its effects, however I have not seen the primary source for this conclusion so I can't agree yet. It is indeed anti-mutagenic, but that could just be due to it being an antioxidant. As for mRNA synthesis, they said the same about Pemoline but this later failed to replicate. Need more data.

In conclusion it's a wonderful compound that I may try myself in the future, but I find little merit for its proposed adaptogenic qualities, and overall disagree that it is in the same class as Bromantane, like the ""actoprotector"" article had tried associating.",1645313778,hxn0tos,t3_swmi5o,t3_swmi5o,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
,"I would honestly skip this stuff. It shares similarities to mitotic poisons used to kill parasites like menbendazole etc. who knows how specific it is to parasitic vs mammalian mitosis? the anti mutagenic effect (a few papers from the 80s) is due to aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation similar to indole 3 carbinol. And it’s partly metabolized by glutathione conjugation which sucks. It might be a non selective Phosphodiesterase inhibitor due to its structural similarities to adenosine or adenosine antagonist. Might as well just use caffeine since caffeine has well understood properties. The anti mutagenic effect of bemethyl was also only against the type of mutagens that require metabolic activation implying that it either inhibits some CYP enzymes, acts as a physical barrier to mutagen attacking DNA, or induces phase 2 detoxification enzymes",1645462365,hxume7t,t3_swmi5o,t3_swmi5o,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,I'm not sure if freebase doesn't work. Beside being stimulatory it has side effects typical for vasodilators like tingling sensation on the face or headache even at 250mg-500mg per dose.,1645346891,hxomhpe,t3_swmi5o,t3_swmi5o,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

,"It’s just that freebase lacks oral bioavailability. Freebase works good for other methods of administration I.e. sublingual, injections, or intranasal.",1645347075,hxomqdv,t3_swmi5o,t1_hxomhpe,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Spirited_Gap7644,I see that it holds very key differences and overall is not like Bromantane. I’ve heard them both classified as actoprotectors but I would say Bromantane is more of a true synthetic adaptogen while I wouldn’t say that of Bemethyl. Though I do find the compound to be quite intriguing none the less. Seems to hold a lot of benefits. Though the research is scarce at least it does hold some safety profile being used widely in Russia for some time. Would be interesting to see you do a test run some day to see what your thoughts on the compound would be!,1645339583,hxod0p8,t3_swmi5o,t1_hxnrzdq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
labratdream,I'm not sure which route of delivery i used. I have about 10g somewhere but it it probably is expired.,1645351733,hxosknh,t3_swmi5o,t1_hxomqdv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
