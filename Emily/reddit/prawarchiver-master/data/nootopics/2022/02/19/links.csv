Bemethyl is an Actoprotector with a relatively unknown mechanism of action. It is believed to have action on DNA transcription, spermatogenesis, possess anti mutagen properties in that it protects DNA from harmful agents such as DNA or mutagens, antioxidant, antihypoxiant, and liver/kidney restorative effects. It is a drug that has been in use for many decades at this point with applications in Eastern European militaries for high altitude training, and for workers who are exposed to environmental hazards. It has shown efficacy in applications including stroke recovery, TBI recovery, and chronic fatigue. Additionally, it has a well-known safety profile that makes it not only tolerable to take but a safe compound to consume over a course of treatment. Like many actoprotectors such as Bromantane, it is hypothesized to have a latent and long-lasting effect post treatment. The duration of this post-treatment action is unknown but believed to be long lasting much like Bromantane.

Metaprot® dosing schedule — Please adhere strictly

It is highly recommended to consume Metaprot® within an enteric coating or within a capsule to maximize its effectiveness as it needs to reach the GI tract to work its main action.

Day 6 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)

Days 7-8 are without Bemethyl. You must not dose during this period to give your body time to adjust to the Actoprotector, and to avoid negative side effects. This should also give you a chance to see how your body is responding to the treatment. Continuation begins on day 9.

Day 9 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)

Day 10 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)

Day 14 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 500mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)

Once day 15 is reached you do not need to dose. You must discontinue Bemethyl treatment as per the instructions in order to avoid potentially negative side effects. Once you are done with the treatment, no further cycling is needed for at least a month.

Side effects: nausea, upset stomach, sweating, insomnia, oily skin, dehydration and irritability.

Please also note that this regimen only applies to the Metaprot® which is Bemethyl HBr, Bemethyl freebase **does not** work orally.

Anecdotally and from my experience, I'd reckon that it is among one of my favorite nootropic compounds and it has massive potential in the longevity and wellness parts of the nootropic community. I highly recommend it for anyone who is suffering from some sort of mental or physical chronic fatigue or just doesn't have the motivation To do things. This nootropic has quite literally changed the way how I view life.
