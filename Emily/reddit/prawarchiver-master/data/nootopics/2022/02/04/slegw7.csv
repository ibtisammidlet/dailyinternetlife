sirsadalot,"L-Tyrosine as elaborated on in the past is only effective in a protein deficiency model. So with that being said, it's only a problem if you're taking high doses as it may lead to oxidative stress or decrease dopamine.

Noopept helps focus a bit, personally I prefer 5-6g Piracetam for this purpose but everyone has their own tastes.

NAC can help with reducing addictive impulse, oxidative stress and serve a practical role in various mental disorders.

Combined this stack is safe but I don't fully understand the goal of it.",1644088978,hvqcu5p,t3_slegw7,t3_slegw7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

pharmakinect,"Hi thanks for replying. Is it safe to use L tyrosine with whey protein every day? I want to have better muscle building, and NAC for reducing smoking and noopept Iâ€™m debating with phenylpiracetam, just maybe to focus on something other than smoking for a bit",1644090926,hvqggik,t3_slegw7,t1_hvqcu5p,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,"I recommend trialing Tropisetron from TeamTLR or GTS-21 from [Science.bio](https://Science.bio) as a nicotinic/ nootropic alternative. And upregulating your dopamine with ALCAR and Bromantane nasal spray. I talk about that more here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics\_that\_upregulate\_dopamine\_v20/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics_that_upregulate_dopamine_v20/) 

L-Tyrosine isn't dangerous, but pointless. If you're using whey protein or consuming decent protein in general there is no use in spending your money on L-Tyrosine.",1644095039,hvqnnpp,t3_slegw7,t1_hvqggik,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
