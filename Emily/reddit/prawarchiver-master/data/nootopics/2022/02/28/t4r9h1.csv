,I find it hard to believe that both methamphetamine and amphetamine both cause neurotoxicity as prescribed doses however it's only widely accepted that one causes neurotoxicity at these doses and not the other. I've read both this post and your other post on this subject and you can't say down regulation due to stimulant use is the reason for the neurotoxicity and then not provide solid evidence backing this up. I can understand how you drew the conclusion but withdrawal symptoms and down regulation alone aren't enough to prove that there is definite neurotoxicity caused here,1646194611,hz0av3u,t3_t4r9h1,t3_t4r9h1,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
EchoingSimplicity,"Great post! I've taken Adderall since elementary school, and I'm in college now. It definitely isn't an ideal solution. I developed OCD-like tendencies, at times I had paranoid and delusional thoughts, and stimulants seem to blunt my personality. If I watched a sad movie on Adderall, I would be unable to cry. I have difficulty feeling any level of empathy while on Adderall. It sucks. Currently, as it is, I have to take Adderall to make it through college. I take the minimum effective dose, and only when I need to get work done. Still though, it often feels like Adderall slowly changes who I am to be someone I'd rather not be.

I'm definitely curious about the combination of Bromantane and ALCAR. I can't stop taking Adderall yet. So, I'm curious, would it be advisable to try Bromantane+ALCAR combo while still taking Adderall? Or should I wait until a period of my life in which I can try Bromantane+ALCAR on its own?

IncreasinglyTrippy,"Before my mini rant, let me say I do love your posts and all the work you put into them, and I wish there were more folks like you. So don’t read the following in the wrong way.

Now you seem to encourage folks to get off stimulants which is great, but I think you might not understand fully where most people are at, and just how far they have to be lifted up to get into the functional range, not to even mention an optimal range.

I would LOVE to replace amphetamines with anything else that is less harmful and/or more beneficial but bromantane+acalr did not do the trick. 

I unfortunately don’t understand it enough but my experience and intuition says that it’s more complex than just dopamine regulation.

Imagine multiple bars indicating various metrics of things like:

-	Mental anxiety/restlessness 
-	Physical anxiety 
-	Motivation/Resistance
-	Working memory 
-	Cognitive processing power/speed
-	Alertness/energy
-	Focus/being able to stay on task

Etc etc. 

Various things you take affect those various verticals acutely and over time. 

Maybe B&A affect some of these in some people but I suspect, like me, for many people they don’t move the needle on things like cognitive processing and working memory. So maybe I can start a task and stay on it but I feel like I can’t think and process anything. 

Find me anything that targets enough of these in the right combination/amount to allow people to function and they’ll toss their Adderall in an instance.

The problem could be something else all together and each person is different and these things are hard to diagnose so I still appreciate the work even if it hasn’t helped me as it may help others. I guess I can’t help but react to a call to stop stimulants when I feel that I can’t (mind you I’m not even taking a lot or every day).

xMicro,"This post is an interesting review of general neurobiology a la addiction mechanisms. However, there is an abundance of overly-strong wording that implies a definite effect in humans via extrapolation of rat and primate studies. There are severe apparent limitations to this, especially from a statistical, behavioral, and clinical standpoint, even if primates at first might seem like the ideal model. Unfortunately, as is often the case, things are more complicated than they may appear. I mainly comment on amphetamine and addiction because there is actually quite a bit of human data on this that can be applied here.

**Reward, Addiction, and Withdrawal**
------------
>For example, stimulants stabilize attention in ADHD by making everything more rewarding. But as a consequence, learning is warped and addiction and dependence occurs.  

Citation needed. You can't claim that ""learning is warped"" and ""addiction and dependence"" occur in ADHD as if this is a given... This is contrary to the truth that the majority of patients who do not get addicted to these chemicals. There is also no increase in substance abuse potential in adults (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4147667/) and children (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-research-suggests-stimulant-treatment-adhd-does-not-contribute-substance-abuse-later-life) prescribed amphetamine nor methylphenidate. Do you really think the vast majority of people, if for some reason their doctor stopped rx'ing their stimulant, would buy stimulants illegally? No.. They'd be pissed off or disappointed, but the fact that there's no demonstrated increase of substance use risk to people prescribed them means your assumption of people prescribed stimulants becoming addicted is baseless.

>The consequences of hedonism are well illustrated by stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization: aberrant neurogenesis\[16\]\[67\] forming after a single dose of amphetamine but lasting at least a year in humans.\[68\] 

How does this study (68) reflect the ""consequences of hedonism... in humans?"" 

1. The study had n = 10 and n = 7 on the one-year follow up. These numbers are incredibly low and means that at LEAST one or two of the variables they had were bound to show the result they want. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values and https://xkcd.com/882/ for a satirical, yet critically true, point.

2. Indeed, as in (1), the study showed NO effect on ""euphoria,"" ""anxiousness,"" or ""drug wanting."" However, they did show demonstrated of the sensitization on ""energy"" (P=.03; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.06), ""alertness"" (VAS alert:
F4,36=11.6, P<.001; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.048), ""clearheadedness"" (POMS clearheaded: F4,36=3.02; P=.05; dose
1 vs dose 4: P=.009), and ""positive mood"" (POMS agreeable: F4,36 =3.68, P=.04; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.002). Note that when one p-value did not show or was on the verge of statistical significance, they simply ignored it and accepted the other one. With such a small sample size, wide number of variables, and borderline significance, you can claim just about anything, but a simple few point difference in a single person would have changed the entire outcome from ""no effect"" to ""effect"" or vice-versa, so there's really nothing conclusive here I don't think, especially in chronic use, which isn't considered. 

3. If anything, the **results of this study support the opposite of your points**. There's no increase in addictive measure (euphoria, drug wanting), but there is of focus, clear-headedness, and mood. So, that amphetamine ""makes everything more rewarding"" to the point of ""addiction and dependence"" are NOT supported by this data. Further, the idea that it supports a ""hedonistic"" mindset (defined as ""striving to experience pleasure, enjoyment, and comfort (Huta and Ryan 2010)... The definition focuses on striving for such experiences rather than having them"" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9485-0) is also not supported by the data, which you cite to make the opposite point.
----
>Due to this, low dose amphetamine can also be used to mimick psychosis with schizophrenia-like symptoms in chronic dosing primate models,\[69\] 

OK, but ""low-dose"" amphetamine doesn't mimic psychosis in humans (people rx'ed it for ADHD do not spontaneously develop psychosis or it wouldn't be approved by the FDA...), so how does the primate comparison really have relevance? 

>as well as produce long-lasting withdrawal upon discontinuation.  

Citation needed (human). Also, define ""long-lasting."" Let's turn up the stakes from amphetamine therapeutic use to methamphetamine abuse to make a point. In humans, depression, obsession, psychoticism, anxiety, phobia, paranoia, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, and more are considered to not be present after 1-2 weeks of abstinence. This was one of, if not the largest and longest stimulant withdrawal studies in humans as of 2015 when it was published; it does not rely on primate or rat data. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3071736/
The only symptom that continued past these (up to 5 weeks, as the study is) was drug craving. This is a confounding variable obviously (this is a study of methamphetamine addicts, so the data is not heterogenous to those without addictive predisposition). Because therapeutic doses are not associated with  increases in drug abuse (adult and children, see above), and because those doses are obviously much lower, one could imagine a lower propensity of depression, obsession, drug wanting, etc., most of which would not persist past a few weeks, in normal users. 

Also, do not forget, these results are in the CHRONIC use of HIGH doses stimulants. Despite pharmacokinetic dose ""equivalence"" between primates and humans, your study 69 shows many withdrawal effects that terminate after only 4 days. Either way, as evidenced by the primate psychosis paradigm you highlight, an equivalent effect in humans is not demonstrated.
 
>But here I question the long-term detriment of amphetamine.  
Beyond the wealth of anecdotes, both online and in literature, of prescription-dose amphetamine causing withdrawal, there exists studies conducted in non-human primates using amphetamine that show long-lasting axonal damage, withdrawal and schizotypal behavior from low dose amphetamine. 

Again critically, *not in humans*. All withdrawal symptoms but one above were found to dissipate after 1 week. On the other point, humans who are not especially predisposed to psychotic symptoms (i.e. most of them, including those with ADHD to whom they're prescribed) do not exhibit psychosis.

> These studies are the result of chronic use, but it disproves the notion that it is only occurs at high doses. 

No, it doesn't ""disprove"" anything. It shows one or two examples of association in the primate brain. If withdrawal symptoms dissipate after 1-2 weeks in high doses of methamphetamine abuse in humans, why would low doses of amphetamine use present clinically significant symptoms for a year? The behavioral sensitization study showed neurobiological changes after a year in humans, but it did not show clear, statistical behavioral outcomes.

**Cognition**
-----
>Additionally, amphetamine impairs episodic memory\[9\] 

This summary leaves out crucial info from this study, which has information contradictory to it. The study cited around a dozen studies showing *increases* in working memory, episodic memory *consolidation*, attention, associative learning, and cognitive flexibility from amphetamine. The study characterizes impairments in episode memory *retrieval*. Consolidation is largely related to how working memory feeds thru the hippocampus and encodes information in a way that involves cross-modal cortical association areas. Retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on pre-formed cortical networks.

If attention and memory consolidation are raised, then later recall would be  improved. However, this study isolates the effects of amphetamine *only* to the retrieval day. The study supports that amphetamine increases the ability to form memories if taken when learning, but interferes with the ability to recall memories by proxy of increased confidence reflected in an increased error rate. Note that there wasn't a decrease in correct responses, but an increase of incorrect responses (and only of a certain type of stimulus). So, the solution would to be *take amphetamine when learning AND retrieving, not just retrieving*. If you don't encode it more strongly in the first place, then you can't really recall it stronger later...

This calls upon the idea of ""context-dependent learning"". If you take amphetamine to learn and experience an increase in encoding, you will perform better if you also take amphetamine on retrieval. On the other hand, if you do not take amphetamine when you learn something, then you will do better if you do not take amphetamine when retrieving. This is why people with ADHD are told to take their stimulant when testing only if they took it while studying. 

>and slows the rate of learning (Pemoline as well, but less-so)\[10\] in healthy people. This, among other things, completely invalidates use of amphetamine as a nootropic substance.\[11\]  

I see that they list five criteria for ""nootropic,"" but I'm just going to focus on the first one (learning and memory) for simplicity sake and because this post is getting long.

Study 9 looked at a single aspect (recall) of a single type of memory (episodic declarative) in n = 34 participants while specifically negating context-dependent memory. Here I present an analysis of 1,300+ participants across a variety of cognitive domains for amphetamine:

""We found evidence for small but significant stimulant enhancement effects on inhibitory control
and short-term episodic memory. Small effects on working memory reached significance, based on one
of our two analytical approaches. Effects on delayed episodic memory were medium in size."" (The other effects, such as long-term memory, had publication bias and so they did not conclude anything on it.) https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=neuroethics_pubs. 

Note that this is in healthy subjects, who are much less likely to benefit than a person with a cognitive deficit, such as ADHD. Despite this, there seems to be a small-medium benefit in a variety of cognitive domains (there's unfortunately no ""Limitless"" pill yet... darn), particularly working memory (aka ""short-term"" memory or cognition) and episodic memory (a form of long-term memory), the former of which I believe is more relevant for nootropic users to care about over episodic (which is more associated with memory than cognition). 

----

Off of healthy subjects, subjects with ADHD achieve neuronal patterns that more closely resemble healthy subjects after chronic amphetamine use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3801446/). This was observed by analyzing 29 imaging studies, mainly fMRI. This should further speak to the fact that chronic amphetamine use in rodents and even primates != those in humans, in whom the benefits may be greater.

Because behavioral sensitization becomes addiction with repeated use, but begins after a single dose. That was why I included that study.

>your study 69 shows many withdrawal effects that terminate after only 4 days.

No. ""Even at 20 months postdrug treatment, some monkeys continued to show aberrant behaviors in the absence of additional pharmacological challenge."" This study also shows 9-15 month impairments to locomotion, a sign of decreased dopamine.

>This summary leaves out crucial info from this study

That's true, I'll edit that line to be more specific to what it impairs.

>which I believe is more relevant for nootropic users to care about over episodic (which is more associated with memory than cognition).

That's not true, though, memory is inseperable from cognition, as well as learning. And you're missing the point. While stimulants are known to improve some aspects of cognition, amphetamine fails because it's not neuroprotective and has side effects. The improvement to some things with detriment to others doesn't help its case either.

Rationale: It is widely recognized that methamphetamine (METH) induces behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its specific receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase (TrkB), in METH-induced behavioral abnormalities.  
Objective: In this study, we examined whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a novel potent TrkB agonist, could attenuate behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH.  
Results: Pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10, or 30 mg/kg), but not the inactive TrkB compound, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF) (30 mg/kg), attenuated hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose-dependent manner. The development of behavioral sensitization after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg/day, once daily for 5 days) was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg). Furthermore, pretreatment and subsequent administration of 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) attenuated the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg × 3 at 3-hourly intervals). Treatment with ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a potent TrkB antagonist, blocked the protective effects of 7,8-DHF on the METH-induced reduction of DAT in the striatum. Moreover, 7,8-DHF attenuated microglial activation in the striatum after repeated administration of METH.  
Conclusions: These findings suggest that 7,8-DHF can ameliorate behavioral abnormalities as well as dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH. It is likely, therefore, that TrkB agonists such as 7,8-DHF may prove to be potential therapeutic drugs for several symptoms associated with METH abuse in humans.",1650539361,i5lou6w,t3_t4r9h1,t1_i5lnxyi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

xMicro,">It does occur because of the behavioral sensitization trap I described. And impulsive phenotypes (such as those seen in ADHD), are more susceptible to conditioned place preference (addiction) in this rat study, employing low prescription dose amphetamine after conversion: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3242916/ (keep reading for a human study with similar results) 
 
The sensitization effect you described in the human study from before again showed only half of the measures reaching statistical significance, \*none of which were related to the addicting effects\*. And, of the half that did reach significance, the significance was weak best. Further, even if every single effect did reach significance and showed clear sensitization, you realize that this was mainly based on subjective self-reports, right? They show a lack of sensitization in drug-wanting, euphoria, etc., have weak statistics, have an extremely small n, and do not have objective outcomes.    

As for the new study you listed, yes, RATS show this, but you don't point to any evidence of human use at normal doses. I'm not sure to which citation in there you're referring specifically, but they reference associations of impulsivity and DRUG USE several times in humans. How is this relevant to therapeutic, normal dose use of stimulants at all?   

People with ADHD may have a higher chance than the average person in the population to be impulsive and start using drugs, but *the use of amphetamine itself in those with ADHD is NOT associated with higher drug use*, to which I've provided two substantially large citations. Your reasoning that amphetamine use in people with ADHD is due to their higher addictive disposition is thus far unfounded. The sensitization effect, even if present, does not appear to worsen actual outcome with respect to addiction potential.

>Rat studies are not perfect, but not worthless (carry-over for rats and dogs is similar): https://sci-hub.se/https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt196235665  
68% of the positive predictions and 79% of the negative predictions were right, for an overall score of 74% 
 
I'm well aware. I never said they were worthless. They are extremely useful. Rodents point toward research to be done in humans, *but the rodent studies themselves cannot be directly extrapolated to humans without this*. You can theorize all you want from rat studies, but you can argue that the same effects will show up in humans until you're blue in the face, but that doesn't make it true. 
  
I'm not sure how they define ""right,"" or what data these were looking at. But for example, say researchers show that abusing amphetamine causing addiction and sensitization in rats and then predict it would also occur and decide to study it in humans. If they show any effect at all, then the prediction was ""correct,"" but that doesn't mean that the degree/severity of it is behaviorally relevant in humans. Lastly, this was from the early 1960s! I shouldn't even need to say why a retroactive study on animal model accuracy in humans from this period wouldn't be relevant...  

>But this doesn't even factor in the REPLICATION CRISIS showing only 40% study reproducibility for Clinical Psychology (consistent with other fields as well). This is why an estimated \~100 million rodents are used to study medicine every year in U.S. labs alone. And this data does not support your dismissal one bit.  

This data does not support your point either. I agree there's a replication crisis, but this doesn't to either one of us more over the other, so I'm not sure of your point here. 
 
>PRIMATES ARE EVEN MORE ACCURATE: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4145602/ and at this rate I'd ask you to specifically name what the genetic discrepancy is, because you only argue out of bias, it's so obvious.

*I* only argue out of bias? Wow. You literally reject the human studies I linked in favor of rat studies, which are obviously going to show more profound and consistent results than humans. 

>Amphetamine correlates with cognitive decline in humans: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31421431/

Did you even read this? They propose a dementia risk as a theory and describe a proposed experiment for the future... They do not actually experiment nor study anything here...
 
  
>Did you read their qualification for substance abuse? It doesn't talk about addiction at all, but episodes of psychosis and hospital visits. How does that support your point? It doesn't, because that's not what addiction means.  

Yes, I did read it, did you? It talks about substance abuse and addiction, including the ""possession and use of illegal substances."" Substance abuse is a PREREQUISITE for addiction, so these results indirectly incorporate the addiction potential of the substance. They say, ""One possible mechanism would be that ADHD medication leads to less exposure to substances and, thus, less chance of developing dependence or addiction."" 

I further present studies which do not rely on hospitalizations.
""The use of stimulants to treat ADHD has been controversial
for some years, in part as a result of speculation
that exposure to stimulant therapy somehow leads directly
to substance abuse. This persistent fear has been generated
somewhat by the fact that stimulants have a potential
for abuse in spite of the fact that there is little responsible
evidence that this [that stimulant prescriptions lead to it] is actually the case.""
https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/4662/

""Despite some discrepancies among the findings of the 7 studies, the meta-analysis demonstrated that exposure to stimulant therapy for ADHD does not increase the risk for developing substance use disorders but is, in fact, protective against it. Stimulant treatment of ADHD appears to reduce the risk for substance use disorders by 50%, thus reducing the risk for substance use disorders in ADHD youth to levels well within the normal population risk.""
https://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/addiction/substance-use-disorders/does-stimulant-treatment-lead-substance-disorders/

>Refer to my statement: ""This isn't to say that stimulants aren't necessary."" Any data you use against me about the benefits of stimulants in ADHD is completely irrelevant, and at this rate you are only doing so to manipulate the audience into believing I am against treatment. This is not the case, I am against amphetamine SPECIFICALLY.

Irrelevant? So the RAT models of addiction are superior to ADHD models of humans to predict results in humans? The truth is, we don't have human data on long-term use of the addictive potential of stimulants in clinically healthy people, and probably will not for a long time. I'm using the available data that we have. The HUMAN data does not support that acute use of amphetamine will lead to addiction. Humans have more self-control than rats in case you haven't noticed, despite possible sensitization effects that may occur.

I'm not trying to ""manipulate"" anybody. I'm trying to present the facts of human research.

Acute studies in healthy people (without ADHD) show minor-moderate benefit on several aspects of cognition, as I linked before. Your personally being against amphetamine is fine, but that does not mean that the effects you claim in humans are necessarily true.

>Here's a study that does show the development of behavioral sensitization, tolerance, euphoria and drug-wanting/ drug-wanting in low dose amphetamine in HUMANS: https://www.nature.com/articles/1395696 interestingly also showing some differences between men and women as well. This also backs up my use of hedonism, which is self-indulgence, not the sub-par definition you used. 

Hedonism is about not only self-indulgence but the *pursuit* of self-indulgence; my ""sub-par"" definition incorporates what you say into it. Regardless, from your own study: ""In summary, we observed significant progressive increases in *some* subjective behavioral ratings following repeated d-amphetamine administration, which may serve as a human model for behavioral sensitization. *However, a decrease or tolerance to drug liking also seemed to occur, suggesting a separate process from these other behavioral ratings.*""

This again suggests that it is not as simple as just sensitization like in rats. There are changes in behavior with repeated use that OPPOSE each other; this is also relevant in the other study on human sensitization you linked before that are at play. Further, humans have a different degree of self-control, and have not been found to have increased potential to abuse substances (which is a pre-requisite for addiction).

vSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway plays a role in behavioral abnormalities observed after administration of psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine (METH). This study was undertaken to examine whether the potent TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) could improve prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in mice seen after a single dose of METH. Treatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10 or 30 mg/kg) improved PPI deficits in mice associated with exposure to METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, co-administration of ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a TrkB antagonist, significantly blocked the effects of 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) on METH-induced PPI deficits. In contrast, administration of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF: 30 mg/kg), an inactive TrkB ligand, did not affect METH-induced PPI deficits in mice. An in vivo microdialysis study in conscious mice showed that 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated increased dopamine release in the striatum, after METH administration (3 mg/kg). This study suggests that 7,8-DHF can improve PPI deficits in these mice, through the inhibition of METH-induced dopamine release. Therefore, it is likely that TrkB agonists, such as 7,8-DHF, may constitute a novel class of therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases such as METH-use disorder and schizophrenia.",1650539491,i5lp0yy,t3_t4r9h1,t1_i5loetw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

I did not say that it isn't linked to depression! I said that the incidence of depression mostly decreased after 2 weeks of abstinence. 

As for cognition, my original study did not mention that. The effects of the withdrawal are wide and varied. So far, no affective symptoms have been shown to last longer than a week or two. The only effects that persisted were drug wanting (my study) and now cognitive impairment (your study). The results of these even are mixed, as the study mentions. All the other effects went away (my study). My point was that, for those effects, amphetamine therapeutic use ought to have even more benign outcomes. Either way, the cognitive impairment thus described is in methamphetamine abusers. No such effect, and in fact the opposite effect, has been shown in humans (acute healthy use and chronic ADHD use, as there are no healthy chronic use studies in humans I know of).

>That's not true, though, memory is inseperable from cognition, as well as learning. 

Um, it is easily separable. Episodic memory recall in a non-context dependent manner as in that study has nothing to do with episodic memory consolidation and then recall in a context-dependent manner. Recall of facts and your current working memory are related insofar as cognition and memory are related, but these processes are easily separable in cognitive psychology. Either way, https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=neuroethics_pubs showed increases in recall. The study you mentioned even increased recall in the cases where context-dependent consolidation (amphetamine upon consolidation and recall) was present.

>And you're missing the point. While stimulants are known to improve some aspects of cognition, amphetamine fails because it's not neuroprotective and has side effects. 

Yes, it has side effects. Is it perfect? No, of course not. No one's claiming it is. however, does it show effect and is it tolerated in the majority of users? Yes. 

>The improvement to some things with detriment to others doesn't help its case either.

It's personal risk vs. reward. You can be personally against it, and have the opinion that the benefits are not worth the risks; that's fine and I have no issue with that. I only have issue when you claim that there's no benefit in a context where it would not be expected to (i.e., non-context dependent settings), or use rat studies as undeniable evidence for an effect that hasn't been shown in humans. 

>I don't know what's more comedic, the fact that this was posted to psychiatry.com or the page-long list of funding disclosures. Additionally this study is fundamentally useless because it thinks it can depict the enhanced neurogenesis I described with a MRI, but again, it's malfunctioning. An MRI would not be capable of determining the difference.  

Neither are comedic. If randombumfuck.com posts the results of a study they found on PubMed, does that make the study itself comedic? As for the funding thing, yeah... that is just the state of much research unfortunately. If you don't want to accept such research, then you have even less human data among the paucity already. 

>I did cite it. Dude, are your stimulants already wearing off? Regardless, here it is again: https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics\_that\_upregulate\_dopamine\_v20/  

Dude, avoid use of ad hominems when it has no relevance at all. It's pretty annoying. I was just referring to the fact that you could have linked the study you were referring to directly, instead of making the reader dig for it themselves when it's surrounded by many similar studies... It should always be clear what you're referencing.

>Where is the exclusion criteria? Where are they ruling out dietary restrictions? Why do you still not understand that Tyrosine Hydroxylase is rate limited despite it being common knowledge that Tyrosine Hydroxylase upregulation underlies the neuropharmacological benefits of many drugs, and that L-Tyrosine has failed in many circumstances.

I do understand it. And it is not as simple as you are saying. Tyrosine hydroxylase, like any enzyme, is rate-limiting when it is *saturated*. Do you have any evidence that it is saturated during these acutely stressful events. Do you have evidence that tyrosine can't interact with some upstream effector protein to alter the expression of TH? I don't; I haven't looked. But, because there are several studies that *do* show benefit, it is worth investigating *how* it might be causing such an effect. Just because it is rate-limited and saturated in normal conditions (when L-tyrosine shows no benefit), doesn't mean that alternate conditions (acute stress), in which *things aren't normal*, when it may indeed. You can't say that L-tyrosine has no effect and is ""likely not 'deficient',"" just like I can't say that that TH is saturated or not, for certain without some sort of evidence. We can only hypothesize based on existing data.
 
>I'm sure you think you're doing the right thing with your persistent attempts to detract from my work (I know my stance is not public opinion due to years of misinformation), but the truth of the matter is that you're not right about this stuff and even worse you're rationalizing the use of amphetamine and methamphetamine and slowing the innovative process.  

I'm doing this because there is some misinformation and misleading extrapolation of information. It's not about doing ""the right thing,"" I just don't like it. How am I ""persistently detracting"" from your work? This is the second or third post I've commented on like this over the past year. We both have high affinities for argument; it's no surprise that those encounters get drawn out.

My goal is just to provide constructive/critical points and to get you and others here to stop saying and extrapolating things with such certainty. You can say, ""X has shown behavioral sensitization in humans. In rat models, this indicates addictive potential. In human models, the results are more mixed and there are opposing results of sensitization on addictive potential, but these are nonetheless risks that must be weighed."" Basically, just to be more critical and cautious of your wording and to let readers form their own opinion from the data. You can highlight more than just your own points/beliefs/conclusions.

Ill_Possible_7740,"A long time ago I was taking 60 mg of Adderall per day. Stopped taking it when laid off. Took it a few times a month for job interviews etc. Took my brain  and endocrine system 6 months to feel like my pre medicated self. I had only been on Adderall for 1.5 years by then. Don't know where you were at when unable to get a refill. But it sucked for me for the first 2 or 3 months I think. Tired, agitated. etc. I have ADHD but also convinced I have Sluggish Cognitive Tempo which has effects of sleepy during the day and brain being, well, sluggish. So anything that even minutely makes me sleepy I am hypersensitive to. And anything stimulating at night I am hypersensitive to.  So, my issues may or may not be worse than yours. If your endocrine system isn't also taking a hit, then that is better than I was. I'm only surviving the shortage so far because I held onto meds when I was switching between so had so 10mg adderall from 2010 and a month and a half of 60 mg Adderall XR from 2009 or so. Taking Strattera that I have from 2018 which helps to need less Adderall.   


I'm getting ready to switch to Modafinil if it works for me, with Strattera. You may look into that. People have mentioned that being on Modafinil or it's racemic twin Armodafinil with Adderall, they only needed a fraction of the adderall they would use without it. May try Adrafinil  which is related since i've seen it on nootropic sites without a prescription.   


Ultimately I am on this thread to find out about upregulating my broken brain from Amphetamines so I can get onto a reasonable dose of Modafinil with Strattera and mitigate the withdrawal while trying to I don't lose my job.",1682725172,ji4bzgy,t3_t4r9h1,t1_jfgu42f,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

This is not dopamine upregulation. It's a MAOI.
