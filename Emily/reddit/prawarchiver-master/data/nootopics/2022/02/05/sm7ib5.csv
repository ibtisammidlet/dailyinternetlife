Ill_Possible_7740,"I know I've seen references to withdrawal at low prescribed levels, but don't have the links off hand. But they are out there.

&#x200B;

But, tolerance starts within hours possibly minutes of your first dose, the pharma industry knows this and designed their extended release meds  on it. And dosage recommendations are actually based on the fact. They also mention that a smaller IR dose later in the day can help alleviate the crash at the end of the day, (which is really very minor withdrawal).

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/)

The above link explains acute tolerance and the design of extended release Ritalin And Adderall. Buy design, they account for tolerance within hours and the reason they changed the recommendation for not dosing a small dose IR  later in the day but the same amount later in the day, due to same day tolerance.  Which also explains the reason they recommend ""vacations"" from your meds.  Like on weekends or a couple days or more every couple weeks etc. To reset that accumulated tolerance that may not have been upregulated.

i.e. When you take MPH or AMP your brain starts trying to get back to homeostasis within hours. So when you take a dose during the morning, by the afternoon you have already built up a tolerance and require a higher blood concentration just to maintain the same therapeutic effectiveness as the morning. Example, with Adderall you take the same dose about 4 hours later essentially doubling your blood concentration, yet, you are just maintaining the therapeutic effect, not doubling it.  Your brain starts shutting down receptors by pulling them into the cell. Need more API to trigger what is left. But, overnight, your brain can upregulate those receptors back into play. Which is how the people who are steady on a smaller dose manage it. Sleep issues that escalate the amount needed the next day, accumulated downregulation or toxicity damage, being on the medication for too long during the day so it stays in your system too long to  fully upregulate during the overnight break. That is how it goes for everyone else.Which is why they changed the recommendation in the 90s and early 2000's of having a small dose later on to maintain the medication was not working. And the recommendation became same dose 2 or 3 times a day depending on the medication and the person. Which is what the extended release versions attempt to mimic. They try to mimic the AUC curve of TID usage.

The idea that MPH and AMP are equally toxic and addictive is BULLSHIT. MPH does not enter the cell. AMP does. AMP enters the vesicles and kicks out the neurotransmitters. Which directly affects supply. Some ends up in the cytoplasm where it can oxides into ROS, can damage mitochondria and other structures. End up in extracellular limbo where it gets oxidized into ROS. MPH doesn't do that. AMP does that and inhibits reuptake to boot.  AMP effects DNA in the nucleus affecting long term adaptive changes as well as delta FosB expression.  And really, this is a high level  explanation missing most of the laundry list of what is actually going on.

As an analogy, MPH is like a bouncer at the door not letting people back in. More people in the street making noise. AMP is a DEA raid kicking everyone out. Residents are running out the doors, jumping out windows, some stay in the street in the synapse. Those that take the side doors or jump out window just end up wandering around till they find a purpose or become a zombie and start biting things. Then  DEA starts wrecking the place, while not letting people back in. Residents that get lost or don't make it out, turn into zombies and start biting things. Eventually P450 comes around and is like WTF? You DEA guys gotta go. The cell is like ""is the coast clear""? Then starts opening windows and doors it had recently closed. If the place isn't to wrecked it tries to clean up. Otherwise it just closes down. MPH is just thinking, all that was unnecessary, just wanted to get some homework done.

On another side note, why haven't I seen anyone mention how AMP can totally eff up the endocrine system? Mine is wrecked. Done by regular therapeutic doses. Some things it can effect, E.D., Gynecomastia, Low T, high estrogen, infertility, diabetes etc.

How long does 5mg last you for the day? Acute tolerance starts to build right away downregulating receptors.  Which is why they recommend a second equivalent dose 4 hours later which doubles the blood concentration just to maintain the same therapeutic dose as when it kicked in earlier for the afternoon.    
And did a therapist rate you on a scale as to about how  affected you are compared to the population of those diagnosed with ADHD? The psychologist who did 3 visits for the testing portion of my diagnosis rated me as between 4 and 7 when I asked. So probably a little more than average.

If you read the sources, you'd realise that none of them extended this conclusion to humans. Why? They're studying the neurological and behavioural effects of amphetamines in animals. Variations in intraspecies drug response is substantial enough to deter any well-informed person from making strong assumptions that extend interspecies.

You're the one claiming that these findings are explicitly relevant to the human brain; it's on you to provide evidence that these results can directly be extrapolated onto a different species instead of relying on inferences from nonhuman primates. 

Even Ricaurte is prudent enough to acknowledge that it's not an open and shut case in humans:

>*These results raise obvious concerns about clinical drug treatment of ADHD, although extrapolation to human populations may be premature until possible species differences in mechanism of action, developmental variables, or metabolism are determined.

The outcomes in nonhuman primates just aren't as damning as you seem to imagine. You're not going to be the one to solve this neverending debate by making implications from a couple of nonhuman primate studies in a short post. 

>*Long-term exposure to amphetamine throughout adolescence in non-human primates has been observed in three studies. The animals were given daily doses of amphetamine that caused blood plasma levels of amphetamine equivalent to or slightly greater than those observed in adolescent humans prescribed the drug. Two of these studies found no discernible adverse effect on their physiology, behavior, or dopamine system development,[1][2] while one observed long-term damage to dopaminergic nerve endings.[3]*

Some things don't translate well to humans, some things do.  I've seen that mentioned in various research. I am not going to search the net to find those articles again so yeah, not looking to put in that much effort.

  
I can guess that some facets of these animals have been observed to work the same or near same in humans which is probably why they stated what they did in the first place. 

   
Even if something translates very well from one species to another, it can't be taken as fact if not thoroughly vetted in both species. And with limited time, money , resources, research will often remain incomplete while other more interesting or funded or non controversial etc. options are available for research. Big pharma pumps a lot of money into research that can help them prove something works and side effects in the short or near term to pass FDA approval to market. They don't pump a lot of money into how many years later their product may be damaging peoples brains. Especially when they can at that point blame it on other things or the person in particular and claim that current body of research they funded says it's safe.  So yes, we do have to make inferences at times because there is nothing more at this current time in history.  And most of the time we can't cut open peoples brains like we do rats to see what happened so there will always be some obstacles.  There have been former meth addicts who donated their bodies to science so they were able to observe certain structural effects that were also observed in animal studies.  Which adds to the suggestive and circumstantial body of evidence. Obviously there are limitations like limited subjects, lack of definitive personal history, no control group etc. At some point when there is enough of it, you have to admit that at least some of it is likely right. Especially when you can find people who have negative effects to their brain on prescribed doses. 

There have been some short term behavioral studies that are in line with in vitro and in vivo studies such as finding some level of withdrawal even at low doses of Adderall. Which  shows there has to be a negative effect in the brain and when something has a negative lasting, even short term, effect by definition it is neurotoxic. 

Just take SCT as an example. ADHD was the big buz and got tons of funding since the 80s while SCT was left behind. Yet 30 to 60% of ADHD-I people are comorbid with SCT and of people who have SCT, they find approximately 50% are comorbid with ADHD. Which is literally millions of people in the U.S. yet, not even mentioned in the DSM-V and almost no therapists have even heard of it and yet are treating millions of people who have it. Which may lead to inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and non optimal selection of medications and therapeutic effect. Should we deny it exists because research is incomplete? Or is it better to acknowledge there is a disorder and that we can infer certain things about it and address it even without complete information?   


Some therapists actually know that amphetamine at prescribed doses can cause RLS, which one common factor is a depletion of dopamine. And depletion of dopamine has been seen in animal studies. And reported in human studies. We can't conclude 100 percent that it wasn't caused by another common cause of low iron without testing for that or ruling out any other possible cause of RLS by people reporting it after taking amphetamines. But there is enough evidence for those therapist to treat for low dopamine and adjust Adderall dosage to attenuate the issue without waiting 50 years for conclusive studies to be done.  Other issues seen in animal studies should at least prompt action to attenuate the possible issues instead of potentially damaging people's brains and causing harm now instead of people 50 years from now.

One persons experience is proof of nothing. but personally, Adderall has been ruining my  life. Was on max dose of Concerta, then started 30mg Adderall XR (equivalent to 15mg 4 hours apart by design). Even at that dose, after a few months it started a downward slope of anhedonia, lack of motivation and energy, muted emotions, low testosterone, decreased libido, weight gain. gradually escalated the dose to 60mg a day. 1.5 years later I was laid off so stopped taking it. Took 6 months to feel normal again. Napping several times a day when before Adderall I could take a nap if at the right time of day. But no way I could keep napping on and off. Everything Adderall was supposed to fix was well below my normal levels for months. When I started it again it took a few weeks to reach the negative aspects and dosage that took months originally. Taking ""medication vacations"" was a waste. Could notice a difference but didn't last long enough to justify wasting 3 weeks of my paid vacation to sit at home sleep and watch tv and get nothing I actually need to get done finished or even started. Adderall or dexedrine being the only variable being changed can only conclude Adderall sucks and the last 15 years since has been ruining my life. Yet dependent on it to be functional enough to keep working until last year. And no matter how much I take, damage and downregulation means I haven't felt ""sharp"" on it in a decade.  So me and thousands of other can't simply ignore all the research you choose to ignore. I do take it with a grain of salt and don't assume it is 100% accurate or things like bromantane will do for me exactly what it has in research articles on animals. Which is why I look for reviews from people on Adderall and the general consensus is that people have benefitted from it as described by research and it is one of the top recommended things by other people taking prescribed amphetamines.  Still inconclusive but far better than flat out denials and accusations of simply peddling bromantane.

Another thing denied over and over again is that amphetamine is excitotoxic to the NMDA receptor cells or that it produces excess glutamate that causes apoptotic cell death and site inconclusive animal trials not replicated in humans. Yet I have seen many people mention being prescribed the Alzheimer's drug memantine which is a non competitive NMDA receptor antagonist to prevent tolerance and neurotoxicity of those pathways. Some people even claim to repotentiate adderall to a lower dose. Inconclusive evidence in animals being applied to humans and working. 

Same thing with Strattera as a weak NMDA receptor antagonist. But with far less research. Yet 3 times in the last 15 years it reduce my 60mg of Adderall to a more effective 40mg even after stopping strattera. The 3rd time I actually kept taking Strattera a few months more and it was still improving my Adderalls therapeutic effect.  I'm convinced those inconclusive claims by researchers that some think NMDA excitotoxicity is the likely largest single route to building tolerance. Unprovent, inconclusive, not proven to translate to humans denied by most therapists and pharma industry. Yet after denying it have not found a single one  of them to even offer a better reason or say why it can't or even may not be possible. 

All in all, after seeing several psychiatrist over the years. sirsadalots post have been shown to have far far more merit with my personal experience than any psychiatrist so far. And for therapists helping to solve the issues I've had or even improve anything at all with my Adderall issues and tolerance. Therapists 0 for 6. Me, I lost count but only 1 thing ever didn't work so around 6 for 7 or so at this point. Much of which based on research on animals and not conclusive or even tried in human studies. Not including trying a few eastern european medications and other things that I was not sure how I would react to them.",1709191479,ksny81j,t3_sm7ib5,t1_hvxftl4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

sirsadalot,"The ""differentiation"" is in direct medium spiny neurons versus indirect. This is the problem, not the solution. And it's caused by the opioid receptors downstream of dopamine excess. Taking low doses of the poison isn't progressive, and it's certainly not helpful.

This aberrant synaptogenesis is what causes schizoid symptoms. And contributes to other issues such as dyskinesia, addiction/withdrawal and more. Behavioral sensitization - it happens, but it isn't good!

And you can disregard the damage that happens elsewhere outside of your sparse rodent models such as to enkephalinergic neurons, axonal damage, etc. sure. But either way this concept of yours is failed.

fascist_horizon,Supplementing exogenous glutathione will actually lower your glutathione production. If you were to take L serine and n acetyl cysteine then you'd have the building blocks for glutathione and you wouldn't have to worry about lower glutathione production. L serine/D serine both have many other really awesome benefits besides being building blocks for glutathione. The NMDA influence sirsad brought up would be enhanced by D serine. But I believe El serine contributes more to glutathione production. Someone else can chime in or you can research it better yourself for accuracy purposes  Something else to consider would be adding black seed oil extract or oil itself and sulfurophane and emoxypine.,1645566365,hy0ovi8,t3_sm7ib5,t1_hvzhymk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Ill_Possible_7740,"I'd also mention taking moderate dose B-complex, se-methyl L-selenocysteine, and zync with a little copper. Vitamin Bs are in many reactions in the brain including glutathione production. And when you don't have the right b vitamin at the right time your brain produces homocysteine instead of methionine  which is bad for example. selenium is also involved and the form I mentioned is purported to not produce ROS, or at least not as much as other forms. And better absorbed. Zinc I think was involved with the cycle as well. Zinc blocks copper absorption so it is recommended when taking a zinc supplement to take one with some copper. I take 15mg zinc with 1mg copper from vitacost. Stays below the zinc upper limit and leaves room for zinc from other sources.  Selenium upper limit is 400mcg a day. I take the se I mentioned from life extensions that is half the upper limit leaving room for other sources during the day.  
Cysteine is the rate limiting factor of glutathione so NAC is the first thing I would take after B-complex. Glycine can also be a lesser factor. I take magnesium bisglycinate which lands me extra glycine while getting my fix of neuroprotective mag.  Also take trimethylglycine. Which is a rare methyl donor that doesn't get oxidized when the methyl group is donated. And can do it 3 times before leaving you with glycine.
