Because of interactions with cytidine, uridine increases production of CDP-choline which shares similar effects to that of uridine supplementation

>Treated animals displayed an increase in the dopamine receptor densities of 11% for those receiving 100 mg kg-1 and 18% for those receiving 500 mg kg-1 as compared to the control aged animals that had received no CDP-choline.

The dopamine reducing effects may actually be a good thing. It may prevent stimulant tolerance. Timing and dose is crucial however.Uridine is generally inhibitatory in nature. It induces sleep and is anti-epileptic. It should be taken before sleep or in the evening.

>A 10-h intraventricular infusion of 10 pmol of uridine from 19.00 to 05.00 h resulted in significant increases in sleep in otherwise saline-infused male rats (n = 8) during the environmental dark period (20.00-08.00 h).

>A small dose of uridine (1 pmol/10 h) exerted no effect (n = 6) while larger doses (100 and 1000 pmol/10 h, each n = 5) resulted in slight but insignificant increases in SWS and PS.

Cytidine supplementation was associated with an earlier improvement in depressive symptoms (weeks 1–4; p=0.02, 0.001, 0.002, and 0.004, respectively) and also produced a greater reduction in cerebral glutamate/glutamine levels in patients with bipolar depression (weeks 2, 4, and 12; p=0.004, 0.004, and 0.02, respectively).

The facts are that it is a direct carcinogen, albeit low grade, and this doesn't require a dose threshold due to the mechanisms.

Uridine can enhance dopamine release from amphetamines via PKC Beta II and D2 but the result is contextual heightened inhibition which is mediated by GABA and serotonin. It decreases dopamine release from other things, such as social isolation, morphine and more; I don't believe this supports your view of it enhancing the highs in life.

My cycle can be 3 days sometimes or it can be a week or a month or two.

But I don't get manic so to speak, I get a kind of hypomania where I'm more impulsive and eccentric, more prone to spending a lot of money and being generally irresponsible, stuff like that. 

But I'm always heavily, abysmally depressed, and so it's just worse for that part of my cycle.

On top of that I have the most extreme social anxiety it's literally crippling and I used to be a complete shut in that didn't even eat because anxiety about the checkout at the grocery store.

I also have ADHD and I had a polysubstance addiction too when I was younger. 

I'm still reliant on a few key chemicals to stay functional but cycled to eliminate addiction, tolerance and to reduce the onset time of permanent loss of efficacy (I've experienced with almost everything)

I don't know how to help you because I havent figured it out myself...

For depression the thing that brought me back from absolute rock bottom was ketamine, once or twice was all it took but it is not permanent yet the tolerance is. I take a single dose prob 3-4 times a year.

Microdosing LSD between every 4 days to once every week, or sometimes a couple weeks without has been keeping me positive and energized on those days, and mood better than in the gutter on the other days...

ADHD meds are harder though, addictive personality and impulse control plus depression and apathy about my life isn't a good combo to have a big bag of stims laying around but practice and maturity has helped me manage to take 10mg of 4f-mph every 4 days to help be productive and focused (it sucks though IMO and I think ritalin would be best but I'm not able to afford it illegally). It can also set off a pretty strong swing in my cycle so it's hard to balance. Plus doctors are reluctant to prescribe anything for it due to the bipolar and anxiety... Also my history but fuck that I was immature, I'm a god damn post secondary graduate, a scientist now and not addict, just trying to keep my life on track because it feels like I'm playing this game on the highest damn difficulty setting...

Sleep problems are a bitch for me and always have been but benzos were a horrible idea. Modafinil or fl-modafinil (CRL-40,940) have been helpful with that... Magnesium perhaps too and vitamin D is essential (I'm Canadian and don't go outside much either so I take 5000iu)

Doctors and psychs don't have much clue how to help so far due to all these comorbidites but I'm still trying.

I've tried 10-15 different meds like antidepressants and antipsychotics and mood stabilizers but nothing worked, only escitalopram and only for about a year before it didn't anymore and stopping it was 1.5 years of absolute hell that nearly destroyed my life.

I've tried hundreds of noots and supplements too, research chems as well but the only consistency is nothing works for very long...

labratdream,"Longvida, robuvit and pomella are easily available in usa. Robuvit is sold by swanson and pomella from nootropicsdepot. You can buy longvida literally everywhere.

Oh and I forgot you can try also pure EPA oil like vegEPA, high epa EyeQ or superba2 krill oil. For me they are powerful nootropics though not very agreeable with my stomach. Nevertheless there is a strong evidence of usefulness in mood disorders

""Some studies have also demonstrated that different dosages of EPA and DHA may result in different levels of efficacy. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that EPA, mostly at dosages of 1 or 2 g/d, was better (than placebo and DHA) as a monotherapy or adjuvant in the **treatment of mild to moderate depression and that the ratio of an ‘active’ synergetic effect between EPA and DHA would probably be either 2:1 or 3:1**""

""Compared with placebo, EPA-pure (=100% EPA) and EPA-major formulations (≥60% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits with an EPA dosage ≤1 g/d (SMD = −0.50, P = 0.003, and SMD = −1.03, P = 0.03, respectively), **whereas DHA-pure and DHA-major formulations did not exhibit such benefits**.  
Current evidence supports the finding that omega-3 PUFAs with EPA ≥ 60% at a dosage of ≤1 g/d would have beneficial effects on depression. Further studies are warranted to examine supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for specific subgroups of subjects with inflammation, severity of depression, and the dose response for both EPA and DHA supplementation.""

labratdream,">Robafen

If it is pure dxm it's ok. Just remember dxm can be toxic and addictive. In studies for depression treatment they used doses

""AXS-05 was titrated to a final dose of 45 mg dextromethorphan and 105 mg bupropion twice daily""

Also don't take it before any serious mechanical or mental work because it is dissociative.
