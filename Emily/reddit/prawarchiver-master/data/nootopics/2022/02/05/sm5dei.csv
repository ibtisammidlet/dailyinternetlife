Neanderthulean,"I don’t disagree that “more dopamine inherently=good” is a naive point of view, however I don’t see anyone in this sub making blanket statements like that for the general population. There’s a tangible number of people who benefit from dopamine sensitizing substances such as ALCAR or Bromantane, in the specific cases of those people, it could be that “more dopamine=good”. Everyone here knows that it’s not the only neurotransmitter that affects mood/motivation.
