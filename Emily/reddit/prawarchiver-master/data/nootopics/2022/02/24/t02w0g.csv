,Taking it everyday has felt counterproductive for me since it has caused a sort of depression or exacerbation of anxiety. I have probably downregulated my trkb receptors a lot as was described in mice. My verbal fluency is slightly improved but overall less happy etc. I wish I knew what actually could upregulate TrKb but I really don’t know. Probably exercise and growth promoting nootropics.,1645707889,hy8i9xx,t3_t02w0g,t3_t02w0g,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
