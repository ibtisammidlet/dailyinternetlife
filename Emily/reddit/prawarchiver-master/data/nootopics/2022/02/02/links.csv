Took it 5 days on, 2 off, since I didn't want to deal with the immediate (negative) effects during the weekend.

Shortly after dosing, I would feel more energized, but also spaced out / symptoms of DPDR + a severe headache and increased emotional numbness. It's worth noting though, that I felt a little better than usual **before** starting Bromantane, so perhaps there's some kind of placebo effect going on.

After about 8-10 hours, I would feel much better all around though. Increased mood, motivation, pleasure, etc.  This only lasted for about 4 days though, after that the Bromantane either had no effect, or a negative effect, as I feel worse now than before starting it. 

Tried increasing my dose to 50 mg sublingual to no avail. 

**What I'm wondering now** is it possible that Bromantane has some kind of ""worse before it gets better"" deal going on, similar to some SSRIs? Wouldn't make sense on paper, and I found no research to back that idea up either.

I also think / hope my condition worsened on its own again and don't want to blame the Bromantane prematurely, otherwise my report would be the only anecdotal report of Bromantane having a pronounced negative effect. Still hesitant to keep taking it though.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane only working the first few days?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/skjr2q/bromantane_only_working_the_first_few_days/

I’ve recently quit Phenibut and Nicotine and wanted a dopamine kinda hit so I switched to Bromantane as it is way healthier for the brain.

I started taking it sublingually this Saturday that just went past. I emptied 50mg of powder under my tongue and within 20 minutes I got sort of a “euphoric rush”. Not as intense as other drugs but still noticeable. 

This made me quite excited for the substance as I used to just dose orally. I was looking forward to the doses. 

I then started to notice subtle waves of euphoria throughout the day on day 3. It was a warm body buzz which was a little tingly. 

Today was really weird, I didn’t even dose Bromantane but it felt like I did. I was feeling a very strong sense of euphoria at around 11am and the last dose of Bromantane was yesterday around 2pm. 

I’ve noticed the effects are becoming more and more pronounced day after day. Is this how it’s supposed to be? Or could it be because I’ve quit 2 dopamine killers on top of this?

Whatever it is, Im loving it and it’s doing wonders for my addiction. 

NAC however, did not help me at all. I tried it and hated it at all doses. It made me feel like a zombie.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane Reverse Tolerance?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/sixolz/bromantane_reverse_tolerance/
