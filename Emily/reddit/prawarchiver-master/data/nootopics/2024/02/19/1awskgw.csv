themission2,"Having a lower body fat means having higher testerosterone levels. Also, having lower triglyceride levels is associated with better brain power.

Even without any science, being fat makes the body heavy and prone to being worn out faster.

Needless to say, energy levels are important when considering cognitive performance.",1708956752,ks7wm05,t3_1awskgw,t3_1awskgw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Doctordup,"If you are doing any kind of keto or low carb, your brain thrives on burning fat instead of glucose. 

People on keto feel better mentally, it's very clear that this happens clinically  and anecdotally. 


I work in a brain specialty clinic I'm not a licensed medical professional and this is not medical advice. I can only give you my clinical experience info. 

I used to work at a children's hospital where we had a pediatric neurologist who had a medical keto program for kids with autism/on the spectrum and ADHD. Some of these children made total turn arounds. Some were non verbal and started speaking for the first time. I was on keto for 16 years. Mentally it was some of the best, clearest thinking of my life. 


The brain can run on two different types of fuel. It can either run on glucose for energy or it can run on fat/oil for energy. Kind of like the difference between a regular gas powered car and a diesel-powered car.

 When you eat a keto diet and your body goes into ketosis mode where it burns fat for energy instead of glucose, the brain loves it and gets energized through this. 

Lots of good things happen in the brain when you go into ketosis. This can also happen with people who do 72 hour or longer fasting (water and electrolytes only with no sugar). 

They will go into ketosis and the brain starts burning fat instead of glucose. There's very much of a euphoric, clear minded feeling.

So it depends on how you are losing weight and whether you are taking any peptides for the weight loss, that can also make a difference in your brain function.",1708567589,krjplqs,t3_1awskgw,t3_1awskgw,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
mikorbu,"There’s nothing but benefits!

From just the physical side you’d find:
 a higher HRV, better recovery and resilience to stress, better circulation/respiration, less inflammation and immune system health (which controls aberrant inflammation), less heavy metals/toxins (they get sequestered into our fat), lower estrogen and higher testosterone/ DHT (neurohormones are king for cognition)…

…and that’s not even counting the actual benefits of exercise on the brain and things like mitochondrial counts, function, and NAD+ production. Plus looking and feeling good is insanely important for stress balance, mood, and cognition. 

There’s also the common possibility of sleep apnea or hypoapnea (even sporadically from just having too much histamine build-up) when overweight, and as a result also getting stuck breathing incorrectly (mouth/shallow) which is murder for an oxygen gourmand like the brain. 

The resolution of that is enough to make a person feel like they’ve been reborn— there’s an app called SnoreLab that records your sleep with loosely estimated REM/Deep measurements that helped me realize I was snoring and with some mouth taping and Wim-Hof breathwork daily (could not recommend this more it’s basically good for you drugs lmao) and boom—
suddenly my life changed for the WAY better.",1708573874,krk56qu,t3_1awskgw,t3_1awskgw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

astray488,"In theory regarding Male's (bio. sex); increased adipose creates higher Estradiol production which then fights for SHBG and ""clouds-out"" free testosterone and thus DHT turnover.

Free testosterone and DHT have well-studied unique psychotropic effects. In brief; they can have direct impact on monoamines (especially an increase in Noradrenaline and GABA). They are Male's ""endogenous benzo's"" in terms of reducing anxiety levels. This is independent of one's ""body-image"" in relation to social self-esteem.

I owe you some sources cited if you want. I wrote a paper back in college with a rather feminist professor. It was a cordial discussion, actually. Male/Female sex steroids have unique benefits for both sexes.",1708743785,krv8p4q,t3_1awskgw,t3_1awskgw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

DiegPosts,"I see, I do fast until 4:30pm, but it doesn't sound like I'm going into ketosis. 

I do have ipam peptide but that's more for a better sleep, and I think the weight loss effects are a minor. 

I was more interested in how the presence of a lot of fat on a person affects how someone may behave, but it is very interesting what you said about kids going on keto diets and having their symptoms reversed. 

I don't think I could go in the keto diet because I just eat whatever I want, and I don't ever want to really think about what I eat. It just takes too much effort I feel like, and our fridge is always crowded and it's not like I can have my own personal fridge where I can put stuff I should be eating in.

What about for endurance athletes?  I run ~7 miles a day and then work an active job on my feet.

I eat insane amounts of food, including tons of carbs, as it seems to be the most efficient fuel for my active life.

Doctordup,"I know of endurance athletes who are on keto. You would need to be dedicated. We test ketones just like diabetics test glucose. The fuel is fat, good fat, avacado oil, coconut oil, proteins. I've seen runner friends of mine take packets of flavored coconut oil along on their runs. So think of it this way, once you are in ketosis you switch your fuel from carbs to good fat. That's the difference. There are no glucose highs and lows because your body doesn't need sugar to function. Hope that makes sense.",1708762667,krw78po,t3_1awskgw,t1_krt4ftl,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

astray488,"Ohhhh boy; time for my opinion. I'm going to stick to the puny human empirical science perspective:

All life feeds on life - for one reason: Survive and reproduce. Pass on our DNA to offspring and ensure the continued success of the ""Tribe"" we're in and overall species.

We hoard calories for survival when the environment we're in condones it. Estrogen encourages serotonin production predominantly - which leads to less competition, risk-taking and overall ""at-ease"" with life and societies status quo. Perfect for a human society that is thriving off the fat of the land and their fruits of labor. No need for dissidence, conflict, etc. All good baby; we chillin' 

Now the opposite: Fighting for and starvation of resources. War. Time to kill and go hard. Adapt or die; the strong will eat the weak... so if we're lean; we need to  take risks to ensure our survival. Less empathy, more savagery. 

It's a product of adaption. Food industry knows what sells to the human lizard brain - so our modern society has this excess caloric, high fat, sugar and non-dense food at our whims. Most shit is automated now too. Human brain is lazy and adapts quickly to the path of least resistance (until challenged, like again - war/conflict/starvation).

So why does modern society have a juxtapose on excess food, but fat-body shaming? Ask yourself this: Do you really think this is a safe world to live in today? Or for your kids..? Exactly. We know deep down we still need to be lean predators ready to tackle everyday dangers.",1708747078,krvg6g1,t3_1awskgw,t1_krvcceg,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
