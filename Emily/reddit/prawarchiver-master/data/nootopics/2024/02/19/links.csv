Extremely well tolerated at low doses, I’m shocked it hasn’t received more attention in enhancement forums.  Does anyone have any experience using it?

Unfortunately it seems like homeostasis catches up to you. There have only been three instances where I have felt like I had a boundless amount of energy. 

Two random instances where I took 100mg of pregnenlone in the evening (and I've taken this at least two hundred times where it did not do much)

And for 24 hours the first time I took a tiny amount of methylene blue. Subsequent higher doses did nothing. 

It seems like my energy quest is failing and my body is rejecting my efforts at every turn... shame... 

Pregnenelone is dependent on how your body metabolizes it and that's a very complex thing, and Methylene blue overrides the energy complexes in the mitochondria. Clearly both are not reliable.

I have dyslexia and a result have very shitty short term memory and often forget things I read,where I put things or tasks any idea what I could do to improve it.


Note that I have a good long term memory can can remember things from long ago with high details which other might not but short term memory is shit
