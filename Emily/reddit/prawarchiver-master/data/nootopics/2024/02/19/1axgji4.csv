yuriydorogoy,"Yup, because of trying bromocriptine I found out that I have ADHD. Lots of achievements during that period. Cons.. it’s hard to predict how it will work, it could make me euphoric or focused or angry for no reason ( i was using 0.5 - 1.25 mg)",1708638708,kro6i5x,t3_1axgji4,t3_1axgji4,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

splugemonster,Not always. There were studies done in the 70s with meth that showed this phenomenon in rhesus monkeys and those results were extrapolated to humans and all dopamine agonists / reuptake inhibitors / releasing agents.

yuriydorogoy,"Correct, it was experiment for prolactin optimisation. Found out that it really works as a stimulant but kinda unpredictable. Mb if I could find prolonged form, I would try it again",1708671648,krqdvi0,t3_1axgji4,t1_krof9k3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
