If you are on an SSRI  then the best thing if you can get it is to take T3, that is the active form of thyroid. It will increase your mitochondria, Bodybuilders use it a lot for fat burning. Just try and keep your dose low. 12.5 mcg, Max 25. I take 37.5 but will be on it for life as i didn't absorb T4.",1708909809,ks5hu7x,t3_1axcgfx,t1_ks5fh3l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

If you can't google or simply use your brain to figure things out then you shouldn't be here wasting people's time.

No one is going to google shit for you.


Talking what out of my ass? Simple chemistry that you clearly don't understand and it looks like you don't even understand the internet either.

logP is determined by modelling the chemical structure


You can do so with a computer application.

Clearly you have zero understanding of chemistry and didn't even bother to understand what logP is because if you did you realise it cannot be ""private"" knowledge lmao. Its like saying what's the atomic number of Potassium it's not listed anywhere. What the hell.

I literally googled the same thing I asked you to, and the first 5 links without even going into it shows the logP. Wow. I must be super intelligent",1708659329,krppl73,t3_1axcgfx,t1_krpjaxw,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
