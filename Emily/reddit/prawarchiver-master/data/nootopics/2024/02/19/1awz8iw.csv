This review highlights the different neuroprotective activities of RO investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies, as well as in silico molecular docking of bioactive compounds found in RO. 

The neuroprotective effect of RO was searched through databases including PubMed, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Clinical Trials using the keywords ""Rosmarinus officinalis, rosemary, neuroprotective effect, memory, cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease."" 

**RO, which is rich in secondary metabolites that have memory-enhancing potential, has displayed neuroprotection through different molecular mechanisms such as inhibition of cholinesterase, modulation of dopaminergic and oxytocinergic systems, mediation of oxidative and inflammatory proteins, involved in neuropathic pain, among others.**

**RO extracts exhibited antidepressant and anxiolytic activities. Also, the plant has shown efficacy in scopolamine-, lipopolysaccharide-, AlCl3 -, and H2O2 -induced amnesia as well as amyloid-beta- and ibotenic acid-induced neurotoxicity and chronic constriction injury-related oxidative stress memory and cognitive impairments in animal models.** 

A few clinical studies available supported the neuroprotective effects of RO and its constituents. 

Many studies underlined that constituents of RO may have the potential for developing drug candidates against Alzheimer's disease that possess high bioavailability, low toxicity, and enhanced penetration to CNS, as revealed from the experimental and molecular docking analysis.

FearlessRestaurant98,He was telling to be cautious about piracetam as some people have reported memory issues after being on it for long term. But short term should be fine,1708610327,krlvo0i,t3_1awz8iw,t1_krlv8lt,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Switch_23,"Working memory is keeping the information in your short term memory and at the same time being able to ""work"" with it, modulate it, ... It's not the same as short term memory as that pertains only to remembering, for instance as mentioned above, a phone number. Working memory would be if I said to you to remember 0563479218 and then asked you to recite those numbers back to me but in a hierarchical way, starting from the smallest number and ending with the largest. 

  
Working memory is one of the exec functions which is the most trainable and that is the first way one should go about in addressing working memory deficits. Secondly, it's mostly dependent on dopamine, so improving working memory means using stimulants. Presumably racetams should help, but they'll help the most with LTP (long term memory) as they mostly work via the glutamatergic system. Mglur 1 agonists, such as fasoracetam are the strongest in that regard.",1708597300,krl7m6s,t3_1awz8iw,t1_krl5sao,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
