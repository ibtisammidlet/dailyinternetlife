Narrow_Fig_778,"Well if you have mobility issues modify your diet to paleo preferably vegetarian. Going to the gym stimulates growth (physical and mental) and creates a perpetual cycle of self improvement. Combined with proper supplementation like coq10, creatine, fish oil and abundant clean calories the changes will be gradual but observable. Also, check out rhodiola crenulata, an herbal MAOI that has helped me at my lowest. It will help you get started. When combined with a half a cup of coffee you’ll definitely be stimulated.

Doctordup,/u/diegposts I would try ingestible Bromantane and if you need an extra boost you can always do intranasal Bromantane. I find that for energy the IN Bromantane is not enough. It's good for a boost if you need it. You can also do IN Noopept. It will give you a good boost also. IN NA Semax Amidate is also great.,1708635982,krny5kh,t3_1axa67r,t3_1axa67r,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

onyxengine,"Dude I had really awesome results, and then stopped sleeping almost altogether, that stuff powers you for days.  I cycle it on and off.  Were u taking whole capsules?  I actually crack the capsules open and sprinkle a tiny bit.  3 months in I only get 2-4 hours and am constantly doing stuff.  Maybe try a lower dose and cycle it heavily day on day off.

Its a really awesome tool, for a moment i had the perfect work life balance while running it in my stack.  Always had the energy to work, go for some exercise and social  to boot, and even go back home and work on some side projects.  Compound is beastly.  I cycled it twice and took a long break from it.
