FrogFister,"I'd take the choline source in different timing, it can make you sleepy/crash if you take it with it same time sometimes. Depends.. if you eat eggs daily, you might not need it. Depends how long you take the racetams as well.",1708410807,kr9bwvf,t3_1av19xs,t3_1av19xs,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

While its exact mechanisms are not fully understood, piracetam is thought to increase the sensitivity of certain receptors, including those for acetylcholine. By enhancing receptor sensitivity, piracetam may improve the effectiveness of acetylcholine, which is thought to lead to increased demand for choline. Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine.",1708405659,kr9309s,t3_1av19xs,t3_1av19xs,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

TigerEye408,"This. Nailed it thank you! 
I was going to make a post about why I feel sleepy after taking Racetams. Especially this cycle of Piracetam. I used mainly phosphidtylCholine, CDP choline (citi choline) and took a very long break from alpha GPC, just purchased but I have much lower capsule doses. 

Depends on day, I’ll take 4.8-9gram per serving. Usually 4.8. 3x a day, As a build up But I have felt benefits after 5-6 days when using a method that actually worked once in my system. 4.8 using 2 scoop. 9.6
This is when I used phosphidatylCholine 1/2 hour earlier (direct precursor). 
A mix of Nalt and Citicholine (cdp) first thing (capsule I mixed) was the move. 
Piracetam from a few sources but currently using EC’s. 

Phenylpiracetam, if it’s the liquid one. Wakes me right up. But pheniltropil (tabs from Russia) is different. 
I’ll time my choline use then do a good dose of Pira + phenyl or Pira + Oxiracetam. And report back on each type of choline. Cdp gives a lift, alpha GPC definitely potentiates. 
PSCholine seems like it sustains all day. Smoother. 
There should be a post about which choline source outside of eggs affects who and which gives better responses depending on chemistry!",1708420041,kr9paxj,t3_1av19xs,t1_kr9bwvf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
