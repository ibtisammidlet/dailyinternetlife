DiegPosts,"Well there's the "" for scientific purposes only"" or "" scientific material"" and "" not for human consumption"". 

If you are selling anything meant for ingestion, I'm pretty sure you need a license of some sort for that. 

I had an idea to offer a sampling service where I would just repackage small samples of several Nootropics, but the problem is that there are regulations surrounding that, it's not like I can repackage a bunch of pills already meant for human consumption and then just say it's for scientific purposes. 

NootropicsBox never went anywhere. 

I used storeenvy, it seems like a good platform, 
But for the likes of science bio and all the other websites they have to work with different payment methods and Banks because a lot of big companies won't work with what they sell. 

Think about a lot of the popular sites that aren't very straightforward in their payment methods.",1706924149,kooeovt,t3_1ahikvk,t3_1ahikvk,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

xkzb_gt,"Most VPS hosting companies don't care what you do on it, especially smaller ones. So coding your own website and hosting it or setting up something like wordpress locally on your server would work. With that said some IP:s might be already blacklisted so I'd also check for that - ovhcloud tends to have blacklisted IP:s.",1706975633,koqzbxx,t3_1ahikvk,t3_1ahikvk,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

SalemSavage,"WordPress locally would allow me to sell research chemicals not for human consumption

What's the difference between regular WordPress online and WordPress locally? 

How do I go about setting it up locally. 

I could figure out how to code with AI. But I would much rather use a website builder.",1706988130,korwzgu,t3_1ahikvk,t1_koqzbxx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
