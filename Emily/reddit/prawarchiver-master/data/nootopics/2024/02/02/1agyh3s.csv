I've seen some similar outcome of a cheap (common plant alkaloid) compound do something very similar, didn't save info about it tho

Gabab inhibition seems undesirable, phenibut (gabab agonist) has been the compound who fixed me up best. But didn't continue due to withdrawal horror stories (although I had none, despite high doses and impactful benefits)

Search tpso agonists tho, for gabaa

For me gabaa agonists often are dysphoric. Altough tpso agonist might have extra benefit by complex steroidal modulation",1706915854,kontx1w,t3_1agyh3s,t3_1agyh3s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"Yeah phenibut is really a unique substance and is real mos I think is a lot more complicated than its gaba b agonism. There’s very little published research on it but it’s paradoxical in its dopaminergic activity. It not a very strong gaba b agonist compared to f phenibut or baclofen. 

That said I’m not trying to deny how you react to different agonists or substance.

But I’ve taken stream I like it I had a little bit of abdominal discomfort which I believe my liver which was unfortunate. But allopregnanolone I believe is a gaba a Pam I think at the benzo site. 

I haven’t really had any experience with anything that might work differently than that but I imagine it would have a modulatory effect on the gaba a receptor somehow through its interaction at the benzo site.",1706916628,konvvku,t3_1agyh3s,t1_kontx1w,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

You could try absorbing it in your cheeks? Or other ROA's which reduce such discomforts. Cheeks is recommended for harmine adminstration 30 min prior to dmt nasal spray administration with 5mg increments (timed to your liking), I've read 😉

>But allopregnanolone I believe is a gaba a Pam I think at the benzo site. 

Yea, among things. But a tpso agonist will induce allopregnanolone synthesis, thus logically not be as noisy due to regio aselectivity like exogenous direct supplementation. Is what I'd think



>It not a very strong gaba b agonist compared to f phenibut or baclofen. 

Interesting

>That said I’m not trying to deny how you react to different agonists or substance.

Its too complex. Ever heard of functional selectively? (eg) Apperently Clonidine has that at a2a-adregenic receptors, in a way that makes you forget aversive memory once you bring it up. Whilst endegenous known agonists can't. But I've seen other mechanisms leading to similar outcome",1706923833,koodxis,t3_1agyh3s,t1_konvvku,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"I’m sure I’ve come across it in some of my research but never given it more thought.

[functional selectivity wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity)

It’s really pretty interesting. Once you get to the examples section it really started to make sense to me in the 5ht2a example talking about different agonists and how different psychedelics activate different signaling pathways.

LSD for instance not activating ip3 signaling significantly. And psychedelics activating phospolipase a2 instead of Phospholipase C.

I am making assumptions here but but by not recruiting beta arrestin I think mitragynine or kratom opoid agonist alkaloids would have a functional selectivity.


Thank you for bringing that up.

And yeah I know i shouldn’t but over the years I’ve done a few one month cold turkey wds with doctors just literally quitting and not telling anyone, being cut off and the beginning of Covid. Then there have been the multiple day wds due to doctors not calling scripts or pharmacies not filling.
I have a good p doc and pharmacy now and always start taking three mg at the end of the month to just make sure I have something in case I have to be on the phone with the pharmacy etc.

At this point close to half my life I honestly don’t mind being on them. I do wish the pharmacies didn’t clamp down on the regulation because of the opioid epidemic though.
I will say I don’t plan on coming off. After this long from what I’ve read there’s not any light at the end of the taper tunnel even after a long professional taper.
