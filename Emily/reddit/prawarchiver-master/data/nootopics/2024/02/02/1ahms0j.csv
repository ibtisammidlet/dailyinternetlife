kinderstander,"Nope. Finished a whole bottle (and took 3/day as recommended), stopped and felt no withdrawals. It had a measurable impact on my TMJ pain, anxiety and sleep though.. truly a miracle supplement.. cost was a factor in deciding to stop..",1706935126,kop3cf5,t3_1ahms0j,t3_1ahms0j,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

VillageInevitable,"I think it's generally well tolerated, but I couldn't tolerateit. Within a few days of taking it, I get a sharp pain behind the knee.

kinderstander,"It has wide-ranging benefits on the human body including and not limited to join pain reduction, strengthening bones, preventing osteoarthritis, and improving exercise performance.. I didn’t even know that magnesium helps relax jaw muscles and relieves TMJs of excess strain and tension.. not all magnesium supplements are created equal though.. make sure you get the threonate kind.. I bought “Naka Platinum PRO Magnesium L-Threonate Magtein” that’s available in Canada and found it very effective..",1707803966,kq74sks,t3_1ahms0j,t1_kq6v2jz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"Perhaps mainly antisocial at first and with a certain high dose.

If your brain has balanced itself you'd be likely more social. Drugs that influence the dynamics of certain networks in a way that is not dependend on external (thus also social) input,.. will thus dampen natural responses to external/social inputs. People often forget about how important dynamics are.

Like THC does this too, by binding directly to CB1. While in contrast a FAAH inhibitor could amplify your natural endocannabinoid reapons (thus keep the dynamic CB1 signaling) which is involved in things including 'social play' (read from specific study about this)",1707597798,kptwfs9,t3_1ahms0j,t1_kpan05t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
