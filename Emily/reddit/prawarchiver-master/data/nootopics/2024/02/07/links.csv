I took them for anxiety. It was so cruel, I couldn't do anything or rest. But I was barely able to play guitar, and I was able to play my heart out. So I do regret not sticking onto playing guitar.
But as I took the supplements, along the relief from the anxiety, an amazing amount of darkness has come into my head and I had to lie down somewhere, and stayed there for almost two hours with a completely blank mind. But I was able to sense some kind of a very heavy feeling.
After I regained conscious, I had to move to my bed and slept there for another hour or two. Maybe shorter.

Then I woke up and felt nothing was left. Anxiety was still there but less, but the problem is that I had no feeling, no thoughts, no depth on anything. I simply became a sick, ill, irritated child being stuck in an adult's body. This is such a bad description, but I can't do any better at the moment. 

I've been very sick since that day's night, calling random person and getting rejected, which gave me enormous pain to my feelings, which led to a physical pain, and I had to spend the night feeling pain from every thoughts that pop inside my head and could not get up from the bed the next day.

I've been very sick ever since. Not only my body, but my mind is just as blank. I still don't have anything from my previous self anymore. There's no sign of return. 

Can anyone relate to this? If so, could you explain what's going on inside of me? Please, any thoughts might help. I also have to distract myself as much as possible from these rumimating thoughts that give me pain all the time.


Edit:

I must have mentioned, as this is a very important information, that I am a person going through antipsychotic withdrawal damage(adverse reaction in my case), and the anxiety is the part of it. I see so many changing symptoms within a month, weeks, or even hours, and this particular problem had happened while I was having anxiety.
