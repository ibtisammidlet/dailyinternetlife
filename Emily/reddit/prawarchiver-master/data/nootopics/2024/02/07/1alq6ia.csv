leafghost64,Honestly I'd be more concerned about 5htp and ash,1707379893,kpgi8v7,t3_1alq6ia,t3_1alq6ia,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
FrogFister,"NAC takes the edges off. Highs are not so high and lows are not so low, which is why it's a great supplement to use if you tend to ruminate for one reason or another, I call it the stoic supplement. 

The 5htp is a serotonin booster, this will lower your dopamine and you will feel less drive to do things, if anything you will be more prone to instant gratification. Add that activities which may increase prolactin to further decrease your dopamine, and there you go, feeling like crap.

Ashwagandha is good but use it briefly when you feel your cortisol is too high in a given period of days or weeks, think of accumulated stress, physical and mental as well. 

If you have anxiety, I recommend you get Magnesium Glycinate (see Naturelo brand the green bottle form iherb) and take 1 in mid day and 1 in the evening, after you finish that get any other Mg  Glycinate supplement you want and sup with it on need, few times per week. Also get some Taurine and use between 1 and 4 grams as needed, when needed. 

Sometimes anxiety is fueled by anxiety itself, and the mental aspect of rejecting it/not wanting it. However anxiety if you were to personify it, it is a part of you that needs to be acknowledged for its presence and perhaps its purpose understood. What did it for me besides these sups, was something Ekhart Tolle said about anxiety, when it comes, accept that it is there, stay with it, embrace it and welcome it. Show it love and watch it dissolve. It was one of the most ridiculous exercises I did few years ago and I say ridiculous because it worked for me, never have I had it again. But then again, I also keep supplementing with Mg often and made routines for ending my day in peace and waking up slowly.",1707406654,kphv4bc,t3_1alq6ia,t3_1alq6ia,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

verysatisfiedredditr,"Theres a few people on reddit who have had this anhedonia last for months or indefinitely.Â Â 


I had a conversation last year with someone who was strongly anti NAC maybe I can put you in touch if it doesn't resolve after some more time, they knew a lot more about the negative effects.


Your best bet is to find a really talented specialist, supplements are really hard to work with in a situation like yours.Â  They all do eight things including effects on neuro, hormones and liver metabolism.Â Â ",1707404236,kphohr6,t3_1alq6ia,t3_1alq6ia,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
caffeinehell,"NAC or Ashwagandha can cause anhedonia, but you mean APs and those are notorious for it. It may have been due to the sensitive state from AP withdrawal too",1707403011,kphlbj6,t3_1alq6ia,t3_1alq6ia,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
KiwiStraight9285,"was this your first time taking nac and youâ€™ve taken all the other supplements before, also you may have taken other supplements how do you not know lol, maybe try taking supplements one at a time to see how they effect you, I take nac when I feel my head is stuffed or feels heavy and it helps because itâ€™s a mucolytic or whatever, if I take it too much I just start tasting lots of salt",1707482350,kpmlah6,t3_1alq6ia,t3_1alq6ia,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Endofyouth5775,"Why is that?
I've been using 5htp for a while, and I was only helped by it, if not no effects has happened.
Same with ashwaganda, although I didn't find much help from it often. But sometimes it seemed to help me get rid of anxiety a bit.

I must have mentioned, as this is a very important information, that I am a person going through antipsychotic withdrawal damage(adverse reaction in my case), and the anxiety is the part of it. I see so many changing symptoms within a month, weeks, or even hours, and this particular problem had happened while I was having anxiety. Before I once took NAC in a larger doses, but that time there was no change at all.",1707381752,kpgkpkl,t3_1alq6ia,t1_kpgi8v7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

leafghost64,"5htp used regularly is pretty bad for the heart, and if you don't cycle ashwagandha it might cause anhedonia which I've personally experienced. You could look into low dose lithium orotate if you're coming off antipsychotics, it's a better alternative with much less side effects",1707382325,kpglgcu,t3_1alq6ia,t1_kpgkpkl,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

Endofyouth5775,"As I have mentioned shortly above, I am going through a withdrawal symptoms from antipsychoic and antidepressant pills. I took few doses in last september, and almost instantly, I started having weird symptoms. Than gradually I had more, stronger, to the point every function of mine were diminished, damaged, altered. I was literally a vegetable.
I was slowly recovering until few weeks ago, but then I started having insomnia with anxiety, which grew larger up to the point I became very sick mentally and physically.
The time I took these supplements was when I felt unbearable about my symptoms, mainly anxiety. But compared to now, I had so much to me. I was also able to function in various ways, and I was rediscovering myself in many ways. Now I'm absolutely doomed, and I can't see no hope these days.",1707448886,kpl2jjx,t3_1alq6ia,t1_kpkxtyf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
