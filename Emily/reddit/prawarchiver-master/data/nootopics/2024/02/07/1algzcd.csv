Upset_Scientist3994,"There is another thread just couple days ago about success with Agmatine on benzo withdrawal. Scroll down.

Agmatine is NMDA antagonist natural mild form, so then similar ones natural like magnesium-threonate, zinc, lithium could be used since they at least dont do much harm and are not addictive on their own. 

NAC is classic against addictions on regulating excess glutamate tsunamis after finishing of gabaergic drugs. 

Taurine works on GABA system too, is cheap and lot of extra benefits. 

Glycine enhances the activity of NAC and good sleep aid adminstrated before bedtime.

Theanine as glutamate partial agonist can also limit effect of glutamate storms.

Out of herbs, black seed oil, aswagandha, bacopa, gotu kola, passiflora work on GABA system. Reishi mushroom extract if I remember worked on benzo site of GABA system and may potentially give some mild alleviation.",1707388760,kpgtqrf,t3_1algzcd,t3_1algzcd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

It would probably be worth returning to your doctor expressing concerns about the rapidness of your taper and see if there's anything else they maybe be able to give you to at least avoid seizures. I'm unfamiliar with anti seizure med but glutamate storms are real, perhaps propanol for anxiety.

And as against harm prevention as it is consider getting more street benzos and make a volumetric solution to taper off. With street it's kinda impossible to know dosages but of you are to use wedinos to find out what exactly was in your street blues. The UK has been (compared to the wider world) pretty consistent with what's as described but don't be surprised to find out it was bromazolam in them perhaps even etizolam. I would suggest sending on to wedinos for testing and also going through there archive to see if what you bought correlates to Diaz. The trouble with street med is one pill can have five mg and the other 15.

If you have the capacity to get onto energy control they can tell you exactly but the most important part of tapering is lowering your dose and stretching the times between taking them. Of by some magic you get legit and stable diazepam make a volumetric solution and wean down from there. Obvs it depends how legit your supply was in the first place, others on the sub have mentioned galenika and other brands which typically aren't fraudulent but I do not know what you have access to.

I do all those amino acids for the very reason that they are cheap, 2 of them are your bodys endogenous one in tea itself so safety profile good. They are all mild stuff, but cheap price and safety profile allows you to use them in big amounts when needed in combination synergy. Efficency comes out of that. 

For best options if price dont matter then this NA-Selank which is costly and acutely mayby just subtle can be significant long term solution since it alters GABA epigenetics so impact is set to continue when it runs out, and it is used in Russian pharmacy for heavy drug withdrawal for that reason. Also good safety profile. 

Emoxypine sensitifies GABA and GABA benzo site receptors whilst also upregulating dopamine what takes away apathy effect out of that and that is another of professional choice.

On problem i have always had with the Ashton is the the fact it is reduced in mgs from total dosage but more of a percentage of the total benzos consumed, that seemed like a more stable way to reduce without noticing but who am I to know.

In truth I am not sure what my daily intake of flublam, is it will range between 1.5mg and 3mg daily. I dose betweentwice or thrice daily daily. Fully aware I'm going to have to create a dosage log for each day. There's maybe even an app to do it which could be simpler as in the past I've been taking tally marks of my volumetric doses but when each of my solutions are different strengths it's tricky I could just equally the tally at the end of each day. I started this with minimal amounts of etiz and flublam 6 months ago but flublam is notorious for.smashong your Hypnotic receptors which is gonna be such a pain in the arse.

I expect this process to take no less than 4 months of tapering but getting to sleep is gonna be such a bastard as my circadian rytham is all over the place but I'm gonna try and be strong and not get swallowed by the beast again.

Odd_Watercress_6968,"9mbc is different from other MAOi, it regenerates dopaminergic neurons, so it could bring the joy in life back. It's powerful. But you need to take it sublingual 25mgs. Bromantane I took orally, while I'm on 9-mbc, I didn't like the effect much, because it made me a little manic. 
Tak-653 is bad, because it can cause neurotoxicity, because of excitotoxicity. It upregulated the Glutamate receptors. I would stay away from it. Give 9-mbc with nsi 189 a chance, but 9 MBC needs time to work take it at least for 2 weeks a month would be better and see how you feel. Don't go into the sun though on this stuff, because it causes photosensitivity. and if you take it sublingual route, you might lose the ability to taste ""sweet"", but it's temporary though",1707827247,kq82ejz,t3_1algzcd,t1_kq7xaip,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Borderline26,"Ditching the diclaz for diaz would be preferable but it's not really an option with cash flow current stocks, but I respect what your saying, also your correct in assuming that Diaz and diclaz are viewed as the same but stronger but I also disagree I find diclaz a cold benzos which may make it harder it the cutting but one of the benefits of making my own volumetric solutions is that I can continue to make them then weaker and/or take smaller amounts over time which is the best substitute ill be able to find.

I used the final of my flubromazepam in my last taper and it was sublime with it's amazing half life, no problems at all.

+Not advised+
But I have seen of people managing to taper of with a ezitolam with a very very strong regiment of dose schedules, the basic rules of tapering are slowly lower your dose and also slowly expand the time before redoing it works but its not pretty also take a knowledge of HL and strong self discipline, as all these RC benzos have very different sub unit targets so the transition will be abit cocky but I dont plan on reducing much of my maintaince dose while shifting to diclaz, this is gonna be a long one.

I'm not so much on planning on running a daily microtaper yet but I do believe I can run on an accelerated Ashton using weekly to ten days gaps not every 2 weeks. My plan is to make my volumetrics weaker each time which as long as I kind of ignore the fact I know I've done it I should be able to avoid serious harm aside from the sleep (on my god the sleeps gonna destroy me). If I slip a day or two on a bad one then ill try to not bear myself up too much, there's been alot going on
 in my life recently, self guilt for the odd occasion of getting needing sleep.

My current drinking has fallen alot over the last 3 months were previous it was about 30 units daily and now it's about ten units daily with maybe 2 days of not drinking in the week. It's not great but it's a massive improvement. The worst think is I don't really drink to get drunk I just don't because I do and I enjoy it. I'd be a fool to say I'm not mentally addicted and I'm walking the tight rope between physical.

It's just gonna take time buddy.

Fasoracetam is something I'm deffo going to look into as I've read about it before, NAC perhaps also and box has been mentioned but I'm not really in a position to import at the minute either.

Pain in the arse when my habits and interests have been how chemicals react with different elements of the human system for the last twenty years.

Ill Get through it but it's gonna be such a cunt, your right to remove alcohol but again that impacts sleep and seems to lead to more Benz.

I shall reconsult doctors but quite frankly to my knowledge there's very little benign drugs or sips that's effect sleep. Considering propanol. I'd rather avoid AD medicine as I believe I can do this myself over time. Perhaps mirtazapine but that's a slippery slope and again the hypnotic factor isn't exactly long lived.",1707415683,kpilyat,t3_1algzcd,t1_kpiguh2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I know it's not your plan but if you were wanting to balance out the discrepancies take ten and make a volumetric solution that should give you the best adverage.
