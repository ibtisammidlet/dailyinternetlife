* Acetyl L-Carnitine (Momentous Acetyl L-Carnitine) - 500 mg: Supports mitochondrial energy production, enhancing cognitive function and reducing mental fatigue.
* Phenylethylamine (PEA) (FitPowders) - 500 mg: Acts as a neuromodulator, potentially improving mood and cognitive function by increasing the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.

Adaptogens and Stress Support:

* Phosphatidylserine (20%) - 200 mg: Essential for cognitive function and memory, supporting brain cell membrane integrity.

Energy and Metabolism Support:
* Caffeine (from Green Tea Extract) - 100 mg (Optional): For those who want an immediate boost to alertness and energy. Can be adjusted or removed based on preference for a non-habit-forming blend.

I really feel this information could help many struggling with this

&#x200B;

1. **Do you take Gingko Biloba everyday?**
2. **Do effects are acute or need to buildup like with Ze117 SJW**
3. **What is your dosage?**
4. **Any side effects? Some in PSSD forum say Gingko made them worse.**

Is this just 5-HT1A resensitizing or Amentoflavone being kappa opioid antagonist?

Thank you!",False,t5_4aoxhu,Gingko Biloba promotes hedonic tone,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1axih31/gingko_biloba_promotes_hedonic_tone/
