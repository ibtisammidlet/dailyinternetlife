Upset_Scientist3994,"I guess mainly Ginkgo ability to increase dopamine short and long term, mayby partially via GDNF is biggest factor. And same thing it is dubbed for 'elders herb' since dopamine gets reduced when in old age, so then benefit may be present relatively more.

  
It is said that 3 months time is required for effects to fully come up, what refers to some neural changes in brains what take that time. In Ginkgo case it seems increase of tyrosine hydroxylase neurons (dopamine generators). It also would be explanatory why in old people who have increasingly less of them Ginkgo works best, although for younger too.

Of course then there can be other factors on top of that. But for me it is the only herb what I actually feel.

Upset_Scientist3994,"Clarification of thought and visual field when I have that aromatic pungent extract sublingually. Although such imminent effects would more have to do with plants main function of being very strong blood thinner so it runs better in your capillaries of your brain and retina. This is imminent effect you can feel - although I could not notice it with low dose aspirin. 

  
Then some other effects such as upregulaton of your dopamine production capacity (tyrosine hydroxylase neurons amount) would take long time so you dont 'feel' them in a way that it could be connected to any particular thing what I take anymore.   
Although seen some science paper, that dopamine increase is also pretty imminent as well. 

But I do not go too far into this; if taking numerous substances at the same time and somewhat cycling them, with season and so many other things effecting too it is hard to tell what effects in what way anyway. But as a with whole stack life is more bearable than without it. But Gingko at least blood thinning effect I get instantly....",1708692331,krr9q8f,t3_1axih31,t1_krr41sx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"It is very dependant on your blood constitution. When in 14 years old in school, remember we took blood samples from fingertips and looked thru microscope. It was surprise how thick or thin some schoolkids blood was. Great differences, so I remember still today. 

And this factor affects Ginkgo style things, what main function is to make blood flow better via thinning it. Also tobacco smokers benefit relatively more for this reason.
