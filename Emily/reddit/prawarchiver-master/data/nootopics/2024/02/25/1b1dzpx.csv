Linifif,"The amount of focus and energy that you're asking for is something that not even all of the nootropics and racetams on Earth combined can help you to achieve in any way.

Armodafinil itself would sit this one out...",1709048469,ksdzk85,t3_1b1dzpx,t3_1b1dzpx,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Last time I had to write a quote long paper (MA Thesis, about 200 pages), I had good results with Alcar, Phenylpiracetam, Choline and some vitamins. Plus Modafinil instead of Phenylpiracetam if needed (legally prescribed).

But here, it may depend of your way of working...How much time you have for 50 pages, how many pages a day, the fact that you have completely figured out (or not) each part of your future work, etc.

When you have to work on something which requires more than one or two days of work (let's say more than 10 pages), the main parts are the way you have to work and your daily work ethic.

When my girlfriend wrote her thesis (PHD), it was an enormous work of about 500 pages...but as each part was carefully planned out (one year and a half to figure out the complete structure)  and as she had time to write without any hurry, it went quite smoothly, although she was working full time at the same time.",1709139571,ksk4wvv,t3_1b1dzpx,t3_1b1dzpx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bionickiwi,I didnâ€™t say I need a nootropic to conquer the world. Something to boost slight motivation and focus towards the end of the day. I was thinking moda or its derivatives though,1709051080,kse79zx,t3_1b1dzpx,t1_ksdzk85,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"No problem, it's something I have known (and that we sometimes live with my girlfriend when one of us write a paper for a peer reviewed journal: you don't write in a hurry but there's a deadline and it's stressful, sometimes). 
As you're not in a hurry, but have to work with regularity, I can be a bit more precise:

-a good broad spectrum multivitamin OR Sulbutiamine (Vitamin B1 in a very bioavailable form) if Sulbutiamine is easy to get in your country. Not both as it could be too much B1. I think I would go with multivitamin.
-One or two things for focusing: you take Phenylpiracetam, it's very good. Noopept or Tak-653 (better than Noopept IMHO, available on Everychem) are good alternatives. But if Phenylpiracetam is ok, let's not fix what's not broken.
-For focusing, it can be interesting to use a non addictive Nicotine analogue. Tropisetron or Abt-089 (on Everychem) are good for this. Tropisetron may be a bit more powerful but ABT works too (in a slight different way) and has no side effects as far as I know (Tropisetron gives constipation). Those two are non addictive and won't get you hooked to Nicotine, you can check on Reddit and on numerous studies.

-Are you anxious and fatigued because of stress? If you are, Bromantane or something like Rhodiola Rosea if you prefer herbs can help to normalize your mood. (Don't take Rhodiola if you take antidepressants).

-Modafinil or Armodafinil are scheduled substances. If you can get a prescription (it's easy to grab on the web but let's stay legal...) They work. Very well in some situations. But only if needed. They are not addictive but there are quite serious drugs. Very well tolerated for most people but the rare side effects can be pretty serious.

Try to get enough sleep and to eat well, but I suppose I don't have to say something as obvious.

Ps: sorry for my English, it's not my first language, I hope my message remains quite clear.",1709204347,ksofz4e,t3_1b1dzpx,t1_ksmnx1b,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bionickiwi,"This is exactly the recommendations I needed to hear. Super helpful and informative. I used Phenylpiracetam from Umbrella, I felt like it was legit. Where do you get yours? Have you tried cosmic nootropic?",1709229463,ksq6cpf,t3_1b1dzpx,t1_ksofz4e,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Glad to help!
Umbrella seems to be fully legit. Never ordered from them as they don't ship outside US. For Phenylpiracetam, I ordered from Cosmic Nootropics and from RuPharma (I think RuPharma has a sister company in the US). Both are completely legit and their Phenylpiracetam is pharma grade. Those two are perfectly legit. But on both websites, Phenylpiracetam is not cheap, unfortunately. RuPharma is a bit cheaper for an European, but in the US, Cosmic may be a bit more interesting.

Cosmic and RuPharma (for russian Nootropics), Nootropics Depot (for herbal supps), Everychem and PglChem for more exotic compounds are my go-to websites. 
For vitamins and amino-acids, Thorne is perfect if you live in the US.",1709240730,ksr4t37,t3_1b1dzpx,t1_ksq6cpf,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ornery_abundance35,Rupharma has a US based store - Nootropicsbase. The products which have a US flag in the product photo ships domestic US. My last order for Phenotropil and Semax came in 4 days.,1709357197,ksyqpno,t3_1b1dzpx,t1_ksr4t37,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
