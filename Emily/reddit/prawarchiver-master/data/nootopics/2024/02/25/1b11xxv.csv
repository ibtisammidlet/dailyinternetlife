Friedrich_Ux,Maybe get some powder from a domestic source and titrate down from 10mg. I would use Cerebrolysin or Cortexin for brain rehabilitation as well.,1709015073,ksca274,t3_1b11xxv,t3_1b11xxv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

PowerHungryGandhi,"10mg is mild but still on 30mg daily I have noticed mild or even moderate withdrawal symptoms lasting a few days. Things like anxiety increased brightness and headaches.

It’s pretty much always a good idea to stop a drug slowly. So reduce the dose by 1/2 over - week or two.


Personally I need less than 10 days to go from 30mg to 0 without any noticeable side effects.",1709064598,ksfcruq,t3_1b11xxv,t3_1b11xxv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

-epm,Thank you for your response. I've definitely noticed the increased sensitivity to lights and a low grade headache. That's a good time of reference - thanks so much. Have you taken it long term and then stopped with only about 10 days of effects?,1709081000,ksgonwx,t3_1b11xxv,t1_ksfcruq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Friedrich_Ux,"Nah, not dangerous at all, Memantine is not a very potent drug at that dose, asking a doctor for a lower dose to wean off is not a bad idea but they wont give you powder for volumetric dosing which would be optimal.",1709060554,ksf0cxn,t3_1b11xxv,t1_kse4fz3,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
PowerHungryGandhi,I’ve taken it on and off for 4-7 years. Sometimes for 6 months solid. In the 7-30mg dose range,1709089301,kshayls,t3_1b11xxv,t1_ksgonwx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Yeah but breaking pills up to taper is more practical, in a million ways starting with just picking it up at the pharmacy, paying next to nothing.
And if you need to practice “volumetric dosing” there are a plethora of ways you can if you have a scale.
But I doubt it’s necessary.. I’d just point to benzodiazepine tapers as an example where the stakes are much higher and don’t require a pure powder and a scale.",1709311622,ksvg48v,t3_1b11xxv,t1_ksf0cxn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
