I have started to have a decrease in my migraines (I thank AJOVY). Long story short, my pharmacy and insurance company communication is broken and I probably won't be able to afford to pick my next prescription up.

It didn’t help my pain at all but it significantly reduced my ruminating thoughts and behavior.

It doesn't help how vapes have become so widespread in schools. It's so easy to share and concel nicotine and even thc nowadays, and it's worse when the youngest in society are the most affected. 

Yes every problem is related to each other and it's easy to say Society in general makes more people sad and stressed, but still... we have failed in a lot of ways when it comes to drugs. We don't need another drug become commonplace.  

Edit: I mostly care about young people and the youth doing it because it's just sad seeing people give into that kind of culture and mindset when they could be so much more. Kids/teens are the most vulnerable and innocent in society. The fact that kids can vape in class is disturbing, and the fact that it's super easy to take weed in a vape and share it at school is even worse. It's way easier to do these things and not get caught, and it's also more potent and easier to over do it

Another edit: looks like this is being shared around and recommended to stoners now. Sorry but everyone knows how loud and obnoxious they are about their use on the internet with little regards for actual smart dicussion. So many people are also missing the point of this post as well....

I am talking about young people and how they abuse. Not why I want to take away your rights or anything else. Literally just that yet people want to create some debate over something I'm not talking about. There are so many other places on reddit to do that god
