Wonderful-Life-2025,I know a lot of people think that weed is harmless. But if you looked into what weed does to the brain and find studies that state that smoking weed leads to psychosis & schizophrenia. Luckily my father made me promise that I’d never use drugs. And I kept that promise. My father’s passing made that promise an even stronger reason to keep my promise. When I was fifteen years old I learned that even Tylenol damages the liver. I stopped taking Tylenol after I learned this. When I learned that alcohol was bad for the brain; I stopped drinking. I didn’t consider alcohol to be a drug but it really is a terrible substance. It’s sad and disgusting to see so many weak people fall into using substances. I’m glad I am strong enough to say NO to ALL that crap and do better for myself. Any Bozo can destroy but It takes Guts and Strength to do the Right Thing.

Serve-Upbeat,"Reddit's AI is just showing this to Marijuana users (myself included) to get more eyes on your post and get a (hopefully polite) discussion going 

I agree that companies marketing tobacco and drugs to kids is probably not well-intentioned and entirely aimed at making a profit at the expense of their ignorance/innocence

However, these suppliers exist because there is a demand.

Lets face it everyone is on drugs, including young people, simply because it is human nature to be very curious about substances. If it's not weed or nicotine it was alcohol when I was younger. Plus young people are generally addicted to social media, depressed, and bored so of course they will gravitate towards drugs

Sure I feel bad for kids who are struggling with drugs because our culture is so drug obsessed. But if someone likes weed they will continue to use it, even if it's obvious to most other people drugs aren't always the answer

I don't feel bad about my own affinity for substances. As long as I'm not wasting my life away burdening other people, or corrupting my non-drug using friends, I'm not apologetic about my substance use

Young people will figure it out for themselves. We should only support drug dealers and companies that act with integrity and demonstrate at least some level of morality when deciding how to market and sell any substances",1709363129,ksz085n,t3_1b0xdif,t3_1b0xdif,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Naive-Act-999,"I agree with you, I, myself had started smoking weed when I was 15, first few years it was all fun and games until I started to depend on it to feel 'normal'. My brother was the one who introduced it to me- I don't blame him for any of it, we were just having fun but seeing the effects it had on him over the years really started to make me question it all. The thing is people today don't look at weed has a hard drug- such as heroin and coke, they take a light approach on it because no one has ever overdosed (you actually can't) or die from it which I guess helps but the effect it can have on can really damage you long term. 

Like my best friend's cousin, he started smoking when he was 17 and when he turned 26 he became schizophrenic. It was noted that he did have some (brain problem) something along that, I'm not 100% sure but the weed definitely played a huge part in causing his schizophrenia. Since he's stopped but evidently it was too late.

In the end what I'm trying to say is, I personally do thing Weed is more dangerous than people make it out to see, yes you can't OD or die from it but it can cause serious damage especially if you can't control yourself/ abuse it. I'd say in a way it is addictive once your body gets use to it and the munchies of course if you can't control yourself will make you gain a lot of weight from it.

If you abuse it and let yourself be controlled by it then YES- WEED is a danger to society",1708993748,ksawdkq,t3_1b0xdif,t3_1b0xdif,13,False,t5_4aoxhu

woodrowwilsoncunt,"I’ve done a wide arrange of drugs at a young age, but damn weed gave me PTSD  I actually realized this only a few weeks ago. I had times where I’ve hallucinated awful things that I don’t even want to talk about, and in the moment thought they were real, on edibles. Most of the time weed just worsened my mental health, sending me into panic attacks and feeling the worse anxiety and dread of my life. I’ve even had a bad trip on acid and mushrooms, and they weren’t as bad as weed. But I know some people can have the same traumatizing experiences on psychedelics too. 
My cousin is 24 and hasn’t worked in 6 years. Lives w his mom and younger brother. All he does is smoke all day. If my aunt doesn’t give him money for weed, he threatens to kill himself and goes ape shit on everyone. I’ve know him all my life and he’s so sweet. But he is so addicted to weed, he needs it to function. We can’t get him help because every time she calls cops on him, he acts all normal when they get there lol. We just want him to get better. 
I want to get better too. I haven’t smoked weed in a couple years but i struggle with other addictions and it’s just exhausting. I abuse my medication. I did quit drinking 4 weeks ago. But addiction is so hard for some people to get over. 
At times I love drugs and want to do them all. But I’m reality I don’t think they hold benefits anymore. I want to say psychedelics and k do, but I just don’t see it anymore. If you want a spiritual awakening, you have to do the work not just take a drug. 
Idk I’m very back and forth on this subject. I guess I’m a hypocrite because I take prescriptions. 
Another note- I feel like everyone I know has a mental health disorder of some kind. And I really think weed exasperates that. Idk some people say it helps, but I just don’t think so. 
I think it’s a big risk. I have no psychosis or schizophrenic tendencies except when I smoke weed. After quitting weed I’ve never experienced it again. 
But drugs probably won’t ever go away. So I guess you have to watch some people become slaves to them. And for me I have to watch myself become a slave to drugs too, then I got to pick myself back up again every time and get sober.

tHrow4Way997,"I think this is more an issue with how we as a society are adapting to the new technology of cannabis distillate vapes, rather than an issue with weed itself.

Weed is one of the oldest medicines we have as a species.  It’s also one of the least toxic and most versatile, and can put many severely life destroying diseases and conditions into remission, or at least support the patient in their daily maintenance.

We have seen how it has reduced the need for more harmful pharmaceuticals like benzos and opioids, and also how it provides an alternative to abusing alcohol recreationally.

It is a problem that we are seeing cannabis vapes being abused in schools by children and young people, but this is cultural.  The continuing taboo status of cannabis means that kids grow up being taught by their parents and teachers that “weed is bad”, so when those kids have access to the internet and can see that it’s way less harmful than they’ve been told, naturally they see it as being totally safe to go balls-deep in on.

In contrast to growing up in a household with a healthy relationship to alcohol, where your parents will teach you how to drink safely and avoid the dangers whilst having a good time in moderation.  There are nowhere near as many parents doing this with weed, plus it is easy to access as a minor due to its semi (or fully) clandestine legal status.  

This is a perfect storm leading to a beneficial herb being used incorrectly, causing harm where *it really shouldn’t*; you then see this happening around you and form a negative opinion about this precious, infinitely useful substance.

Much love, I hope this situation improves through better education, better laws, and more open-mindedness around cannabis, so maybe one day you get to see it for what it is instead of your opinion being understandably influenced by the negative consequences of a mismanaged society.",1708994590,ksaymra,t3_1b0xdif,t3_1b0xdif,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

LambdaAU,"Firstly, I believe people should have the right to consume drugs recreationally, in a safe environment. Secondly, the regulation of drugs creates a safer drug environment for everyone. Whilst Weed might be spreading, alcohol use (at least where I live) has been becoming replaced by cannabis use. Cannabis certainly does less harm than alcohol and whilst being addicted to anything is harmful, if people are using cannabis INSTEAD of alcohol then overall it’s better for society. 

Additionally any effort to ban its use will often lead to worse drugs taking its place. Your notion of getting an F- rather than just an F is a bad comparison in my opinion. For example when Spice first emerged in the UK (as a legal substitute for cannabis) it quickly became popular and the drug was banned. Subsequently the drug producers kept tweaking the molecules slightly and producing even more unpredictable, stronger versions of spice. Spice was unequivocally worse than cannabis in almost every way, yet people used it because it was often easier to acquire. By trying to stop mostly harmless drug use, the government inadvertently caused the rise much more dangerous and harmful drugs.

I think THC is a negative influence only because people who normally wouldn't be an addictive person or addicted to other drugs get addicted to weed and that is I think you're displeased by and trying to describe. 

Weed is one of the most nefarious drugs to do for someone who's personality particularly addictive because it just sneaks in, and people don't stress the addiction risk with THC which is why some people succumb to the addiction. It's not as much weed itself and it's the people using them and the lack of education I think. THC was my worst addiction I personally ever had and now I just do opioids and they're (for me, key word for me) less addictive and just as helpful for my CPTSD.

I smoked my teens away and I wish I could just place my current perspective into the minds of the youth so that they can understand just how strong weed is now and also understand just how much it can hold you back. I been there done that, so while I understand teens are gonna smoke weed no matter what, I wish I could let them all know that as a big teenage stoner I wish I could go back and do it all over completely different. 

That being said I’m glad kids aren’t going to jail for it now. I had a half dozen friends as a teen who had their lives completely screwed forever just bc they got busted with a little plant matter. 

So on one hand I agree completely with you. But mostly I’m glad that we’re slowly growing out of the days when kids were locked up and had their whole lives ruined just bc they were going through a stoner phase. And I think that’s more important in my opinion. But damn I do wish weed wasn’t so damn strong nowadays. Kids are tripping out from one hit of this stuff. That’s not good to be smoking this new stuff every day all day.

But on the other hand, I also think a little mushrooms once a year would benefit the entire world unless there’s underlying schizophrenia or other various mental disorders that don’t respond well to that. But if society were to have some sort of screening process, I think a little bit of mushrooms at age 16 and 18 could really benefit the entire population born after that process is created. 😂 

So as you can probably see idk if my perspectives and opinions should be the one that everyone else agrees on and runs the world lolol.

You'll one day realize the kids you know doing it have a lot of other problems in their lives, and they are just trying to find an outlet.  And, quite frankly, weed helps you have a good time, forget about your problems, and is distracting.  

As someone in their late 30s, I can tell you I know a lot more people now who are responsible and smoke weed on a regular basis.  It's a different situation as an adult.  You wake up, drink coffee, go to work, take care of some errands after work, then light up at the end of the day. 

There's people who smoke weed and then there are people that are stupid and smoke weed.  The weed emphasizes how dumb the dumb people already are.  They make a personality out of it, and there's this whole dumb culture surrounding it.  Responsible adults just want to relax and cut loose a little bit with a couple hits and then go to sleep, and it doesnt get in the way of the rest of their lives.  And they don't talk about it all the time. It's not the main activity. 

So, light up and relax.  I'm just kidding.  Don't do it because you have other stuff to focus on now.  But, once you're like 25 or so and have figured out some stuff, give it a shot then.

Go ask your neighborhood police officer what over 75% of their calls usually involve. Clue: it ain’t the weed.

But cannabis isn’t harm free either. Although not as horrific, it can be abused and should not be consumed in excess by anyone.

However, you’re a fool to ignore the many legitimate, medical benefits. And that’s despite the fact that the plant is barely understood in terms of its full potential. Especially when you drill down into the spectrum and infinite possible ways to medically combine cannabinoids and terpenes. 

Its literally natures miracle plant, and big pharma know it, which is why they are MASSIVELY to blame the decades long campaign to stigmatize and demonize it.
I’m sure you can decipher why the egregious pharmaceutical industry wouldn’t like a natural plant that you can grow on your porch in the sunshine and alleviate a great number of your ailments, with essentially zero side effects besides some extra munchies on occasion.

BigFarmerJoe,"I do see it spreading in society. I also see young people changing their attitudes around alcohol. We're changing from a binge-drinking culture to a socially-drinking culture, and that is a good thing. Part of that healthy and long overdue change is offering alternatives that are less physically dangerous and less harmful to society like cannabis. The last time it was tried by the beatniks, alcohol companies lobbied to make cannabis illegal and succeeded. 

Now, finally, young people are once again turning away from the binge-drinking culture that rotted the brains of previous generations and turning to safer healthier alternatives. This might cause some pearl-clutching by people who like looking down on those who smoke. These tend to be people who see stoners as 'that kind of culture and mindset.""

The people who started most of the most profitable companies smoke cannabis. Lawyers and doctors smoke cannabis. Politicians and priests and policemen smoke cannabis. Republicans and democrats smoke it, young and old, rich and poor. Your average american cannabis user simply looks like your average American. His culture is that of the area in which he was raised. His mindset is one entirely resulting from the society in which he grew up. Cannabis does not cause laziness any more than alcohol does. 

Cannabis or alcohol cannot take a man with will and purpose and make him listless and purposeless. That we see so many people down on their luck who consume in excess these substances is a symptom of some sort of inherent lack within the people overconsuming them. It is not a symptom of the consumption. A cannabis user can be as industrious and over-achieving as Elon Musk or he can be as underachieving as that guy you knew who never left his mother's basement. Taking cannabis away from the guy in his mom's basement won't make him into a functional member  of society, in fact, it's likely to take away the only solace he had from his lonely, dark, and disordered existence.",1709340775,ksxqns9,t3_1b0xdif,t3_1b0xdif,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

acousticentropy,"#There is no “proper use” of THC.  If you disagree, feel free to refute the central points of my claim in this thread. 

The youth enjoy it because, [like it or not, THC is a value-changing drug…It changes your values.](https://youtu.be/rn6roeUfMio?si=XhNG1ZkTikfqkG-q&t=8m5s) The new mental perspective allows the youth to see that something they were often told is dangerous, truly is not a danger. This fact, coupled with increased communication between unrelated brain systems, results in a mental state that is primed to question the status quo. 

The youth are always at the precipice of increasingly progressive values and ideas about how society should be operated. THC and certain other substances are accelerating that, which is good if you value societal progression over preservation of tradition. 

Also, THC is NOT a nootropic, where the intended use case is minimal psychoactive effect and maximum “productive” output. **No one is “giving in” to anything, they are selectively exploring altered states of consciousness, even if they do not fully understand what they are doing.** 

The overall results of long term cannabis (and especially 5HT2A agonists) use seem to be open-mindedness, increased empathy, short term ego-dissolution, and a compassionate attitude. Sounds like a profound way to view the world, compared with only valuing productive output or logical intellect. 

OP, you should give it a try! Once per day for a calendar month and each night make some notations about how you notice perceptual changes and if you begin to question any sincerely held beliefs. This experiment is guaranteed to strengthen your conscious awareness and provide development of your values, wether you enjoy every single experience or not.",1709139350,ksk47wf,t3_1b0xdif,t3_1b0xdif,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Chemical relief is a very real thing and it has existed for hundreds of thousands of years. It’s not about escaping reality or an altered reality it’s simply some people like to have a buzz while others don’t. From the sound of it you are an opinionated likely keyboard warrior trying to speak lowly of an American soldier who also happens to be a mom. Shame on you. Stay off the internet you are ruining the tiny bit of good that most of us have left. Now when they legalize meth I’ll have a problem … o wait it is legal!!! It’s called Desoxyn. It’s methamphetamine hydrochloride. Prescribed by real doctors to real people for whom lower stimulants don’t work as well. So some people require weed to function so what dude. Climb down off your high horse and realize you even you in all your righteousness may require an opiate pain killer one day for an injury. Then the FDA freaks out and takes away the one thing that cured your pain. So you try weed and realize that not every consumer is just melting into their couch while chugging Mountain Dew eating Doritos. There are people who use way too much I see people like that all the time but then again I have the life experience to know that maybe that guy or that girl was raped for years on end and maybe that weed they can now legally buy is the only thing that helps them escape that torturous memory.

Weed wears you down mentally over time verses with alcohol you have to potential to do something crazy by drinking too much. Both are bad just in different ways, and ideally less drugs is best. It doesn't really matter if alcohol doesn't have medicinal use because weed is used for pain and most people that don't have pain aren't using it for pain, they're using it to get high. And I think a lot of academic research would disagree with you on the front that it's not addictive, a lot of people certainly get dependent on it and they lose a lot in their lives because they let it numb them and make them complacent. r/leaves shows that ( and studies related to life outcomes and cognitive performance)

And also statistics don't say weed is replacing alcohol, yes there is less alcohol in our generation but there's also more nicotine and weed overall that contributes to a higher amount of drug use which is not surprising considering how bad off our generation is with loneliness and mental health and technology and all of that.

There can be a spectrum of harmful to beneficial psychoactives, but in the end it’s up to each individual to determine what compounds or stacks word for the desired outcome. I’ll give two examples, caffeine and lsd. Are there people that find both caffeine and lsd to ALWAYS be harmful? Absolutely. Are there people that find both caffeine and lsd to ALWAYS be beneficial? Absolutely not. There’s nuance to it. Caffeine may be beneficial in the morning or for an early afternoon pick me up, but before bed, forget about it. Is it desirable to be in the lsd space for a significant chunk of one’s life? Almost certainly, no. But do some individuals experience great cognitive and healing benefits from that space from occasional use? Definitely! I hope I don’t come across as argumentative, because I do understand your point and I have found cannabis to be harmful for me. But that’s my point, harmful for me, no necessarily others.

And that's my problem if it's legal cheap and accessible that means it's way easier to turn around and illegally put it in the wrong hands, and the more you normalize it, the more you make young people think it's a okay and legitimate thing to do, which leads more people to try it which in in the vast majority of cases they lose because of it, they become less.

Delta 8 is a good example of this because any adult can just buy it from a gas station and not just dispensary or dealer and turn it around to kids, or you can have people that are just 18 that can just buy it and not need a medical card (which in some places you can get at 18), which by the way medical cards are pretty b******* because you could just lie and say you need to sleep or have anxiety. 

I mean getting a medical card is just an extra defence to continuing your use for a lot of people.

The kids who are cluelessly abusing it to the point that it’s messing with their life probably aren’t growing up in a home with stoner parents.  There is nobody to guide them *because* it isn’t normalised enough.

Nobody really loses or becomes less through using it either.  Of course if someone gets really stoned you’ll notice that perhaps they don’t seem as sharp or engaged as usual.  This is normal.  It wears off with little to no after effects and you go about your day.  

If you decide to spend all day stoned and not functioning, that is your own decision.  Some people with other existing problems may have more trouble with avoiding this, but at the end of the day, it’s not a substance which wires your brain into a full-blown chemical addiction (mild “withdrawals” aside).  Others (usually consumers in their 20s or older) find it beneficially supportive to their active and high functioning lifestyle.

I mean I guess I'm lucky in that I could check my Reddit throughout work and have the time today to baby this post but I feel responsible since I created the post. 

And there have been people that are luckier than me that have better parents ( my parents are kind of negligent), we have more money who put them through more extracurriculars and whatever, just more involved in their lives yet they kind of threw it away.

I'm not toxic white knighting I'm just sharing my opinion like how Stoners will share their opinion on the internet saying to smokeee it do ittt. So that's not 'toxic white knighting' or you're just calling it that because you don't like what I'm saying and this threat and subreddit isn't on your side?

Every single one of your comments towards me is pretty much projecting on to me. Right now you're trying to say that I'm ignoring the real issues because I'm talking about something I care about. OH OH You know what the REAL issue is? Have you heard about the war in Israel and the Russo-Ukraine war? That completely dwarves any of this drug talk, I don't know why you're not talking about it it's completely bad faith bro!!!

FunRub2580,"Yes, I do get typology, and it is a complete waste of time.  You like to put people into boxes, whether they fit or not, because you would rather have that power/control over them instead of actually listening to people.

So far this entire thread has been on my side, actually.  Yes, you are being a toxic white-knight.  This entire post and your posts subsequently are just judging people for doing something you can never understand and it makes you scared.  If you weren't being a judgemental prick about it, your wording would be drastically different than it is and would actually focus on the *root cause* of all this usage that bothers you so much rather than looking at the medicine people are using to cope.

You are judging people, and you're ignorant to how the world actually works.  Instead of debating and discussing with me you've chosen to just attack and have added literally nothing of value to the conversation.
