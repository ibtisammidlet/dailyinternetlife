Efik_Pail,"Hello,
I sometimes take Phenotropil/ Nanotropil (the two main pharma grade brands).

I'm a bit surprised by some posts, as Phenylpiracetam is quite well known and is a quite safe compound, like most of Racetams.

So, what to expect from it?

If you take it one to two times a week, it acts as a mild stimulant without anxiety (on the contrary, for most people it's quite anxiolytic and normalizes the behaviour). It reduces appetite, raises a bit the pain threshold (that's one of the reasons it's banned in sports), increases cold resistance. (Anecdotal report but based on numerous studies)

I suggest about 150mg of Alpha GPC or 250 mg of citicholine with it.

100 mg (a pill) is good for most people. For some people it works during many hours. If you metabolize quickly, you should take 100 mg in the morning and 100mg around 12pm.

If you take it everyday, the stimulating effects fades but the cognitive effects remain and it will act like a super-Piracetam (Neuroprotector, increases focusing and so on).


Phenylpiracetam is not hard to get (there are at least two well known vendors), it's just a bit expensive these days.",1708945096,ks7a0hi,t3_1b02tm4,t3_1b02tm4,8,False,t5_4aoxhu

Secret-Pie-6313,"Is that phenypiracetam? Never did much for me but maybe I need to push the dosage I've never really gone past 250mg. just feels  like a cup of coffee but also makes me feel tired too for some reason. kinda makes me anxious tbh, it also puts me in a cold sweat",1708905099,ks55td7,t3_1b02tm4,t3_1b02tm4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

The only times I had bain fog and fatigue from Phenylpiracetam was because of a lack of Choline.

In meetings he said he started taking a drug the Russian astronauts took. He became addicted to it, it started giving him massive issues, black outs, seizures etc and by the time he got to rehab he had brain damage and was a jittering wreck.

The brain damage he said was from the drug, he didn‚Äôt say he was prescribed this drug, and certainly wasn‚Äôt given it due to having brain damage as you suggested. He was buying it from his dealer.


Guy basically looked like he had a mixture of Parkinson‚Äôs and physical Tourette‚Äôs/ticks.
