Upset_Scientist3994,"Everything what presses the button on NRF2 pathway. There is a lot for that - and intrestingly many of such are pro-oxidants what then upregulate antioxidant status as countermeasure. SIRT-pathway activators what have become popular in anti-aging stacks should do that too.

I have never used broccoli sprout supplements, only vegetable but that is said to be extraordinarly good. For regular usage it would be best to do your own fresh sprouts from broccoli seeds. Boiling kills useful substances.

Alpha-lipoic acid was NRF2 and SIRT activator, direct antioxidant, but then also could recharge other burned out antioxidants including glutathione. NADH might do that as well?

Then glutathione itself constitutes of cysteine, glycine, glutamine amino acids of which first two are bottlenecks. And if you add on selenium then you get glutathione peroxidase variant as well.",1708846559,ks1exq2,t3_1az517y,t3_1az517y,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

This is over my head, could you explain what you mean here?
