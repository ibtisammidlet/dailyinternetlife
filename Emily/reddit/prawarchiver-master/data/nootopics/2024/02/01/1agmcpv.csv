PossibleDirection524,"Soooooo I just made a batch yesterday! Here's what I did. 

First, I purchased an mg scale. They're pretty inexpensive online. Even though they measure down to the mcg, they aren't even CLOSE to accurate enough to be dosing that small. What they're REALLY good for is making larger batch solutions. 

So I measured out 1.5 grams of bromantane into one of those 30mL plastic measuring cups that comes with the bottles of cough syrup. (This is a pretty goddamn non-exact process.)

Then I filled said container with olive oil up to the 30mL line. Stir by hand for like 3-4 minutes until you have a fairly homogeneous-looking suspension. 

The suspension gets poured into a glass vial w/ a measured 1mL dropper. I then set the glass vial in a glass 1-cup measuring cup (sorry for anyone not US) I filled the measuring cup up with water until it was at or just above the level of the bromantane solution in the vial. 

Remove glass vial from measuring cup. Place measuring up in microwave and bring water to ""boil."" (I mean, just close really. Maybe you see a couple bubbles then turn it off.) Once the water is hot, the vial goes back in the measuring cup, and let it soak for like 5 minutes or so. Shake the vial every couple of minutes. If you did it right, you'll have a 50mg/mL solution ready to rock!",1706828663,koi9v3w,t3_1agmcpv,t3_1agmcpv,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
Black_Cat_Fujita,"I honestly saw no difference sublingual versus oral. Tried olive oil and PEG. Either way, the results weren't consistent. Intranasal has been way more effective for me although using the spray was a bit tricky at first.",1706828532,koi9iac,t3_1agmcpv,t3_1agmcpv,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
MezDez,"This is unnecessary.

Dissolve the bromantane in peg400.

Bromantane has a high logp, it's most likely going to enjoy being partitioned more in the oil phase when it mixes with water (saliva)",1706860544,kok6wjg,t3_1agmcpv,t3_1agmcpv,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Crafty-Emu-769,"I use coconut oil personally, i think sublingual is harder that way but in the end pre-dissolving it should make it more effective oral which is the worst case scenario so i do it anyways
Like 80mg per ml of oil",1707074068,kox0qj0,t3_1agmcpv,t3_1agmcpv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
ArcticPlatypus,"I’m with you. Was using the Bromantane spray sublingually the past month and not noticing a whole lot from it. Switched back to intranasal yesterday and today, feeling way more effects from it. Still subtle but way more effective.",1706845572,kojgm1m,t3_1agmcpv,t1_koi9iac,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Did you buy the spray or make it?",1706833585,koin0px,t3_1agmcpv,t1_koi9iac,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
