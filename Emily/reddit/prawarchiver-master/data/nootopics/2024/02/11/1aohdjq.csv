Legitimate_Banana512,"**ALCAR IS A MUST HAVE**

i think as a rule of thumb you can expect any cholinergic substance to help noticably with this, in some aspects. If not it must be some exception. (Thus also look in this direction)

But.. from those, ALCAR did to me exactly what you ask for. I did not expect that to happen, but it did. Aupplementing ALCAR for a period of time somehow impactdully expanded my cognitive mathmatical abilities, mainly in conceptual thinking, by means of visualisation.

I remember **huperizine A** also helped me (long ago). This was one of the only compounds that felt like a true (small but noticably) IQ boost. But Im afraid it can make my muscles tense up too much. Perhaps there is a therapeutic window in regards to avoiding escalating aide effects.
 
I can't remember the names and all, but there are multiple things involved in acetylcholinergic regulation. I saw a supplement that had Huperizine A and _Eleutherococcus senticosus_(**Eleuthero**) while reading about this. I checked out what Eleuthero could do in this regard. It happens to be beneficial somewhere down the cascade before where Huperizine A does its job..

..So taking ***Eleuthero alongside Huperizine*** A is likely beneficial. Maybe you need to lower both doses a bit, maybe not.

***Others that MIGHT help:***    
**Oxyracetam**, it also boosts the cholinergic system and enhances color. So it very likely will help in visualising abstract mathmatical concepts if you add this.

**Microdose LSD** improves connectivity to the visual system ... And whatever. Don't know exactly what it does but you can imagine it helping. It notably enhances color in a non-static way, it is more dynamic. On a high dose I could spawn in things visually like an awake-ludic_drean

***PRL-8-53*** helps with short term memory, but only tested on verbal short term memory. Is also cholinergic but likely additionally dopamine/norepinephrine is involved

**Ampakines**

***D-serine***

Legitimate_Banana512,"First time I did it for about a year I think. Now back on it since a few months. Via nicotinic receptors it can actually sensitize itself, other nicotinic agonists and dopamine. But yes, besides sensitisation desensitisation can also occur, this can be prevented perhaps even reversed by nmda antagonism (so take magnesium L-threonate, memantine/bromantane, agmatine or other nmda antagonist alongside. Don't take anything that impairs you like a recreational ketamine dose tho)

It is more complex than this btw, you can use other strategies, but this part i talked about it true, that nmda antagonism prevents tolerance and dopamine(rgics) and activity at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors sensitize each other

Perhaps you can also add ABT-089 and Tropisetron to your arsenal, because they also work in this system. But I don't know if they themselves help with visualisation specifically, I do know they both raise IQ",1707765489,kq4f6y8,t3_1aohdjq,t1_kq4dq42,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,It may interact with Sertraling. Although I understand that psychedelics & SSRI-combo mostly just blunts psychedelic effect via excess serotonin blocking those receptors where LSD is supposed to go into doing its trick.

Primary_Damage_8029,"In case you're curious, I have a lot of experience with sertraline & psychedelics. Your intuition is correct, but you have the wrong mechanism in mind.  
  
The majority of sertraline's effects are derived from the desensitization of the serotonin receptors. Receptors desensitize in response to higher concentrations of ligand, which is what happens with serotonin when you take SSRIs like sertraline.

Psychedelics have substantially greater affinities for the serotonin receptor than serotonin itself, so although the two substances compete for the same receptor, the receptor dynamics are essentially the same as in SSRI-naive brains. In brains accustomed to SSRIs, psychedelics are less intense because the serotonin receptors are simply less sensitive, not because the psychedelic needs to shove its way through a thick crowd of serotonin to get to its receptor.",1707869567,kqbb0ey,t3_1aohdjq,t1_kq7xffu,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,">So, ALCAR’s nootropic effect is via nicotine receptor agonism

It indirectly increases the endegenous ahonist: acetylcholine


>What’s been your experience with Tropisetron

Honestly can't tell much about it, but theoretically it'd be very beneficial for me. Its also anti inflammatory and orevents nausea (hate that feeling). And allows cognitive flexibility without being like an in your face interuotion.

Abt-089 felt like it increased the bandwith of my field of focus. Or perhaps increased the depth/the gravity to the sides of what I'd normally think about, without standing in the way of what I want to think about. It like helped me  think about more (beneficial)topics per day(like joining a sport or something), so I'm behaviourally more flexible",1707766016,kq4gqd8,t3_1aohdjq,t1_kq4fvkk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Thanks, that was cool elaborate answer. 

I just had vague memory in mind from some doctor book on interactions with anti-depressants & psychedelics, stating that SSRIs in general weaken response whereas tricyclic antidepressants of older generation may intensify them, and lithium too intensifies them. That was like 20-30 year old text what did not talk about mechanisms. 

But lithium orotate microdose could be good add-on in stack if you are doing micodosing of psychedelics and want to keep the dose low?? 

I have read that not tricyclic, but tetracyclic antidepressant Ludiomil could significantly alter and potentiate LSD trip and provide lucid dreams for nights a week after that. Not tried, but one may assume that tricyclic antidepressants what are nowadays prescribed less may do something like that. Intense dreams were reported by friends who got those by prescription on their own, or borderline dreams as side effect wherein you was not aware if you had awaken or still in dream what were unpleasant. Tricyclic called Tolvon was sought-after by drug users due of that ability especially. 

(Ampakine) racetams are said to potentiate psychedelics as well, so best to keep in mind if stacking with Piracetam and then considering some microdosing on top of it.",1707915268,kqdmmp3,t3_1aohdjq,t1_kqbb0ey,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
