splugemonster,"i dont have experience with TAK but from what i read here it seems to have an anxiolytic and anti-depressant effect without being sedating.

Anyone suffering from depression or anxiety will have cognitive disruption as a result of that. the alleviation of anxiety and depression improves cognition.

Vye7,"This is my opinion but I feel most ADD medication helps you focus and improves executive function but negatively affects you when it comes to memorization and studying. From my experience I would be zoned in but it would take near twice as long to memorize material. I think TAK alone with some choline would be sufficient. 

Also I would be cautious going the nootropic life especially when it comes to taking meds that haven’t been in the markets for over 2 decades. Too many ADR now a days and potential for issues after chronic use",1707770841,kq4uy4n,t3_1ap6eq3,t1_kq4rfp7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
onyxengine,"I wouldn’t consider myself average intelligence, but i have always struggled with discipline and focus.  Celastrus seeds, dry and raw(though nootropics depot makes a supplement now im going to try). Made a huge impact on my ability to get shit done.  

It was the first thing i used as a nootropic, my interest at the time was dream recall, but i started to realize celastrus drastically improved my ability to execute in games(improved motor function, my ability to detect patterns that helped me improve, and thus read the games and make better decisions) starcraft and league are the examples.

Anyways a year later i started to teach myself to code in tandem with learning about nootropics and it was off to the races.  They seriously helped, and are a  hobby in their own right, helped evolve a passing interest in neuroscience from my experience with psychedelics, to becoming my own personal cognitive optimization lab and lab rat.

I have a career as a programmer now with a steep upward trajectory working on shit i never thought I would.  I generally need to supplement to focus, but celastrus in particular increases novel pattern recognition and memory recall and is probably the closest thing ive taken that feels like +10 to iq.",1707923469,kqe5uac,t3_1ap6eq3,t1_kq4rfp7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Odd_Watercress_6968,"I read into 9-mbc and I didn't find any risks if you don't go out in the sun, but do your own research. It's muuch more powerful than NSI and both together are even stronger, they work synergistic. 

Well at the beginning I took both together then stopped 9-mbc. NSI alone has an anti depressive effect and makes me more motivated. It helps me to adapt to the hard ship I'm going through right now. 
But when I stopped it for a week and started again, because I started losing my motivation without it (I'm usually very depressed).
 It made me sometimes a little manic during the day. But after a few days it goes away. 

It's not like it's giving you unlimited motivation or making you a super human, but it helps a lot in my experience.

sjemka,">Actively engaging in researching the mind requires at least average intelligence.

No. Why? below-average inteligence is not uncommon. I don't think you understand how IQ works, and you don't understand how the interest of cognition enhancement look in practice - people can have itnerest in this topic while actually being very very unintelligent, hence why I mentioned stereotypical aunt in a dodgy facebook group, made by some scam-artist supplement seller - this is also being interested in cognitive enhancement btw. The interest in this topic requires literally NO intelligence at some levels.

>You are trying to argue that people who have borderline mental disabilities are heavily engaged in intellectual pursuits.

Below average IQ is not having ""borderline mental disabilities"" . Again, you don't understand the concept of IQ, it's a statistical redistribution, the difference between someone having IQ of slightly above 100 and slightly below 100 is nothing special, yet you make it to be something out of this world.


I saw a study which showed DARK triad personality traits being correlated with interest of nootropics. And I would intuitively say that it is a better predictor than intelligence.

sjemka,">Do you think someone with below average intelligence could write what you just wrote?

You really don't understand what below average intelligence means man. You conflate slightly below average intelligence (very popular, right around the most popular average) with severe mental deficienicies (very rare). 

Also, you don't seem to look outside your bubble on how interest in cognitive enhancement looks. It's analogous to the interest in health in general, and often involves the same people - look at what someone like NLE Choppa says about health in general, and compare it to idk, discussion on r/scientificnutrition - you exclude from this discussion the former groups, who talk bullcrap about cognitive enhancement, influenced by other lunatics or scam-artists, and focus only on the latter. So, bevause of that:

>Do you think someone with below average intelligence could write what you just wrote?

this doesn't matter. And about this statement:

>You’re basically arguing that you think low-IQ people operate exactly the same as people with average to above average intelligence.

 It is false. The most popular kind of below-average intelligence is much closer to average than mentally disabled - but it literally doesn't even matter, because of the 2nd part of my argument. As interest in cognitive enhancement doesn't require anything - to have a discussion about a specific mechanism pf a certain supplement, where you would have to understand specialised literature - yes. But that's minority of minorities in the interest of cognitive enhancement. You could be very interested, have absolutely terrible, simplified sources of information, or not even that - simply spend a lot of time reading if a certain supplement have more positive opinions, or just conclusion on studies - intrest could also be more practical, someone can try shit ton of supplements to enhance cognition while barely reading anything abput them at all.",1707791161,kq6dkdd,t3_1ap6eq3,t1_kq69it7,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
