I’ve noticed the anecdotal experiences on here and other nootropic subs are skewed towards people with above average intelligence already. You’ll read people’s experiences and then they randomly pop out that they’re in med school or that they were straight A students in high school lol.

 I would prefer answers from people who are truly average (or even below average) and have never had much success academically that has seen cognitive improvement from using Tak.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Anyone with average (or below average) intelligence try Tak-653?

I generally struggle with proof-based math and have to devote a lot of time to really grasp the intuition behind new concepts. There's no way around the time-commitment, but I want to develop a stack which will equip me to tackle new problems with greater confidence. To this end, I wish to increase the speed at which I digest abstract concepts. I'd also like to more easily retrieve those concepts from my memory and incorporate them into my thoughts without as much strain. **What are the very best substances for the achievement of this goal?**

&#x200B;

Cerebrolysin has made the biggest difference in my cognition.  However, I have discovered that the desirable changes to mental fluidity, verbal fluency, and sharpness that it gave me at first have all begun to gradually fade with each successive use. Interestingly, pregnenolone has brought some of those effects back.

&#x200B;

I'm not a hyper-responder to piracetam, but it definitely works when I pair it with choline. When I take 5g+, I perceive a more clear headspace (e.g. the absence of brain fog) and don't get as fatigued with cognitively demanding tasks. It can make me a little quick to anger, but that's the only negative side-effect that I've noticed-- I'm self-aware enough that it's not a problem. As the effect accumulates, piracetam improves my verbal fluency and I feel sharper, but I don't think it has made a big impact on my memory.

&#x200B;

Other than piracetam, I have limited experience with racetams. Phenylpiracetam, especially in combination with cerebrolysin, gives me great fatigue resistance and enables me to tackle monotonous tasks with a little more gusto. However, it doesn't seem to make me smarter. Perhaps that's because I haven't used it for prolonged periods due to its steep tolerance.

&#x200B;

I have tried using PRL-8-53, but I haven't had the same success as the first administration, when I studied some past homework right before an exam and found that I could remember them in great detail when I encountered analogous problems.

I'd like to improve upon my current stack. I'm open to anything in any price bracket. In addition to the substances below, I have access to bromantane nasal spray, TAK-653, Cortexin, Tropisetrin, Fasoracetam, and NSI-189. I'm a bit reluctant to take the NSI-189 because I dream vividly every evening. I would like to avoid depersonalization / derealization at all costs, especially because I have many intense psychedelic experiences under my belt and don't wish to become delusional. No family history of schizophrenia, though I do have generalized anxiety disorder (very well-managed, essentially asymptomatic).
