MezDez,"Guys,

You do know you can come off cold turkey, being on benzos like Xanax for over 10 years, or even heroin, using topiramate?

Look it up,

Many case studies. It works so profoundly that they were able to kick the benzo habit within a week that's been there for a decade.",1707007626,kotatjl,t3_1ahuegb,t3_1ahuegb,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Psilanaut,"Thank you :)

I managed to drop from 4mg to 0.875mg in around 6 weeks using psychedelics (4-aco-dmt). Sounds unbelievable but it's the honest to Mushroom truth!

The rest of the taper involved multiple attempts with Ketamine and Agmatine, both of which were extremely helpful for me. I chose to stick with Agmatine since I value my bladder and would rather not mess about with Ket anymore.",1707033707,koupvs6,t3_1ahuegb,t1_koqfz86,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

As I said used it to get off lyrica , zopiclone and now benzo .

Feel free to drop me a DM if you ever want to discuss micro/macro-dosing. I'm terribly partial towards 4-aco-dmt but mushrooms would work just as well.",1707115878,kozt1js,t3_1ahuegb,t1_kovgkmc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
