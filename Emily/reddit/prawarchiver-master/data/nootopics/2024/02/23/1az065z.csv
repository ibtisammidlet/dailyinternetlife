ImpressiveAd6357,I take Nooglutyl for that purpose only lasts for couple hours and gives me a very clear focus. Perfect to get some more hours of productivity in at the end of the day.,1708838427,ks11eqi,t3_1az065z,t3_1az065z,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

The-Swiss-Chad,"Just use a long acting stimulant in the morning?  
I personally like sensai-Drive. It's tPBM.  
Usually my Modafinil dose dosen't last until late in the evening, especially if I don't use it so often. Once your plasma levels have become a steady state, you may not need a boost in the afternoon with Modafinil as it's half life becomes extended and thus it becomes more effective in the afternoon",1708804492,kryput7,t3_1az065z,t3_1az065z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Deathless729,"In theory maybe phenylpiracetam, actually haven’t tried it myself so can’t say that much but It seems quite short lasting like 2-3 hours, but it also said on psychonaut that some report a whole day, so probably best to try small in the day and see how long it last. 

Bromantane is also nice, not really that stimulating but a bit and maybe makes it hard to sleep but not much for me.",1708837910,ks10dtl,t3_1az065z,t3_1az065z,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

greekhoney32,"Yes, it does. You have to buy a good brand with methylated forms in it. I take one in the morning, and I’ll take a second one around lunch, if needed.
