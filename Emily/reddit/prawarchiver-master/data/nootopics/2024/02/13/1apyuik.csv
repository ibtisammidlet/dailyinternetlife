UpsideDownElk,"Yes, I don't think the knowledge on this is near complete yet, but for example:

PKC phosphorylates the dopamine transporter which causes it to reduce uptake / reverse transport (efflux into the synaptic space). Not a problem for most people, but genetic variants and drugs like amphetamines mean that targeting PKC for excessive dopaminergic signaling might be a potential therapeutic approach.

Dephosporylation is caused by protein phosphatases PP1, PP2A.",1709277981,kstlhey,t3_1apyuik,t1_ks4oit9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
animalredd,"Good answer. Would drugs which cause PKC inhibition, eventually upregulated dopamine levels, through compensatory mechanism of the brain?",1709298430,ksugtqi,t3_1apyuik,t1_kstlhey,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
skytouching,"Not likely in a practical way.

This is from the bromantane wiki “…and especially protein kinase C corresponds with the manifestation of the pharmacological effects of bromantane.”",1709314334,ksvo9yi,t3_1apyuik,t1_ksugtqi,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
