Inhibiting PKC blocks AMPH-stimulated increases in extracellular dopamine levels and AMPH-stimulated locomotor activity https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8611615/

The benefits is that it protects prefrontal cortex dendritic spines and cognition from the effects of chronic stress. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ovixyc/inhibition_of_pkc_signaling_protects_prefrontal/


I've read PKC inhibition increases the number of pre synaptic D2 receptors, which I believe results in it upregulating D2 receptors

One more thing: Which between Cistanche & Pterostilbene is best for pkc inhibition? 

This study on Pterostilbene  says ""We also find that PS is functioning more effectively than RS to reduce nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of protein kinase C-β2 (PKC-β2)""  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21355597/",False,t5_4aoxhu,Is PKC inhibition a good or bad thing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1apyuik/is_pkc_inhibition_a_good_or_bad_thing/
