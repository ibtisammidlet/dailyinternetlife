Yesterday I decided to take 90mg at once, considering that studies use doses of up to 700mg.  

But when increasing the dose I felt a slight sensation that something was different, not necessarily a good sensation.  

Which leads me to ask how it is possible for someone to take around 700mg? 

Is it normal to feel this slight sensation?  Does the body end up getting used to it?  

What doses do you use to benefit from the cognitive effects of idebenone especially effects on verbal fluency?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Idebenone dose for verbal fluency,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1b3m7m4/idebenone_dose_for_verbal_fluency/

*Improved motivation in the sense of everything I do I enjoy it more or are motivated once I start doing basically anything in my usual day.

*Energy levels have increased and this basically has became my ""coffee"" in the morning to start off my day and works wonders even on off days that I do not get as much sleep in the night.

*Increase in focus once I start and activity

*Increased mood that lasts the duration of the dose

*Increased memory/cognitive function in the way that my brain feels like it has switched to a mode to retain the information better because I am enjoying the action of learning and am motivated.


Now to one of my main questions of this post. 

I was born with one kidney and I have been trying to maintain and improve my kidney function through suppliments. 

I have heard that bromantane and bemethyl hbr are very beneficial for your cognitive health but the thing that stuck me as significant was the kidney benefits.

I am wondering if using bromantane intranasally would still reap the benefits on the kidneys?

I have recently just ordered a powder form just to experiment with different routes to see what is the most beneficial for me, but I'm just curious on if that would still work.



I also have an order of bemethyl hbr because of the possible kidney and hypoxic benefits. I am trying to find something that could help with my sleep apnea and the damage that comes from the low oxygen levels at night as well as just improving kidney function.

I would love to hear other peoples experiences with both substances and input!
