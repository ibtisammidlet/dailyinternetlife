ChemicallyInterested,"If you’re in the UK, there’s quite a few reputable UGL’s that sell yohimbine. DM me if you like, can fire one over.

I recently published an ebook on Yohimbine specific to its effects on FFA mobilisation/body composition. Pretty interesting molecule.",1709896914,ktwhnli,t3_1b3yye9,t3_1b3yye9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,I would not recommend yohimbine. It’s anti-cognitive (reverse of guanfacines moa at adrenergic receptor) and rather dangerous.,1709332242,ksx4nsq,t3_1b3yye9,t3_1b3yye9,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,Hi. Do you’ve any idea if Mirtazapine is also anti-nootropic or causes adhd symptoms? I’ve read that it also has MoA that is opposite of guanfacine.,1709334341,ksxabz0,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksx4nsq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,"Yes, and it would also have other problems sadly. Is it for a sleep aid or depression? Edit: won’t cause adhd tho",1709334602,ksxb0du,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxabz0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,"I haven’t taken it before; was thinking about trying it though.

Mostly for mood",1709334647,ksxb4gv,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxb0du,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,"For depression, Pinealon and Agmatine are the least polarising options. Other aspects of mood, like motivation, may be better addressed by dopaminergics like Bromantane or Alcar",1709334743,ksxbdo0,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxb4gv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,Thanks. Finding a cheap source for pinealon is tough. Agmatine and Alcar don’t seem to do much for me.,1709336265,ksxfba0,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxbdo0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,"Bifemelane is the best typical antidepressant by far, try that first before other ssris/maois/tricylics",1709336351,ksxfj3u,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxfba0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,"Yeah that’s one of the things on my list. I saw it on PGLChem; might go ahead and order some.

Do you know the dosing? 

(Also sorry for hijacking thread OP).

Edit: and wtf i just saw that everychem has pinealon lol",1709336661,ksxgbah,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxfj3u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,"I was gonna tell you that but then I was like, I’ll tell you after I buy ‘cause I only get paid next week and don’t want to miss out. I’m a bad person.",1709336823,ksxgq9d,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxgbah,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
drugmagician,100-150mg 3x a day,1709336861,ksxgtqh,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxgbah,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,No I understand; I’ve missed out before. Gotta look out for yourself first,1709337224,ksxhqzv,t3_1b3yye9,t1_ksxgq9d,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
