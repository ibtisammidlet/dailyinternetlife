Collationem,"It is absolutely possible to take 700mg. In fact, you likely won't feel anything from it from lower doses, and even at 700mg+ it's very mild. Your effects were likely placebo.

The bioavailability is also very poor (<5%), so I recommend alternative routes of administration.

Most potent thing I tried for verbal fluency was NSI-189, by the way.",1709281075,kstpwo2,t3_1b3m7m4,t3_1b3m7m4,5,False,t5_4aoxhu

NinjaNuclear,"It's sorta just a prodrug for QS10 afaik, which is what we actually want, idebenone itself is not really what we want - the low bioavailablity actually works out to be a good thing.",1709684678,ktjbh22,t3_1b3m7m4,t1_kstpwo2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Collationem,"I started getting random panic attacks throughout the day, also at work without any apparent reason. I'm not anxious by nature at all, so this scared me shitless. That was after running 40mg daily for maybe 2-3 months. I also briefly reduced to 10mg daily for a week with no reduction in panic attack frequency and intensity (I think they even got worse). I could write paragraphs about the positive effects but I think I won't be using it again. Extremely powerful stuff.",1709314144,ksvnp32,t3_1b3m7m4,t1_ksttjjz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
