Odd_Watercress_6968,"What cured my savere depression was 1 month of sublingual 9-mbc(25mgs) and nsi-189( 30mgs) orally. 
But you have to use and train your brain to be productive also, sitting all day on social media, watching a lot of porn and video games will destroy the progress. 
While I was taking this stuff I tried to push myself very hard, like studying every day for multiple hours, going to the gym, no gaming and muuch less social media.
Before these ""supplements"" I couldn't stop the doom scrolling the whole day and I was very depressed. But I was able to stop the porn and video games on my own and of course going to the gym. 

Now I'm very happy and only on nsi 189, but there are side effects. 9-mbc made me not able to taste anything sweet even 2 weeks after stopping. But now everything is normal again. And nsi 189 makes me sometimes a little manic during the day and It makes me sleep 6 hours at night, which makes me need a nap later. But it's okay.",1707653364,kpx3afh,t3_1anprf0,t3_1anprf0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"Glad it helped you!

I think the gym also played a big part.

I've already tried both substances, they are not on the list of my absolute favorites.

I want to try ISX-9 because it basically does exactly what I need, as far as I read. Of which includes amplificating the circadian rhythm signals, I don't get tired when I want to sleep. Anti-depressant effect is a cool addition to what it can do",1707668091,kpy35kk,t3_1anprf0,t1_kpx3afh,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
