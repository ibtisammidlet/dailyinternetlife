Friedrich_Ux,EGCG theoretically prevents the increase in peripheral serotonin from 5-HTP mitigating its negative cardiovascular side effects. I still wouldnt use 5HTP chronically even with 5HTP though.,1708280290,kr0s6ht,t3_1atyrm2,t3_1atyrm2,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
MezDez,"Take your 5htp sublingually. Will bypass some of the liver (supposedly some of the 5htp will go down to the stomach and be absorbed orally). It's in the liver that 5-htp is faced the aromatic decarboxylase..

You can make 5-htp topical which will ensure it will bypass liver via first pass metabolism. I believe a mixture of ethanol and DMSO should do the trick.",1708296166,kr20qok,t3_1atyrm2,t3_1atyrm2,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
