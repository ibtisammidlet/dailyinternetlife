CryptoEscape,"I’ve collected pharmaceuticals my whole life ( yes I’m a weirdo) , RC’s, nootropics, herbs, and some I’ve had over 20 years.  

They still work fine, even though the bottle say they expired a year after they were prescribed.

I’m sure there was a slight drop in potency but it wasn’t even noticeable.",1708219984,kqxg9z2,t3_1at4dk0,t3_1at4dk0,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
limitless1370,"I bought more than 10 bottles when it was released after being out of stock for a while. It's been over a year now, and I haven't noticed any decrease in potency.

Legitimate_Banana512,">But they're set so conservatively because biochemicals could be that unstable, right?

That'll always play a big part in professional setting yes. Professionals are biased away from risk, overly cautious in the eyes of an avarage 'consumer'/'patient'.

If you could do what they recommend I see no reason why you wouldn't just be overly cautious as well, they know you can't forsee every risk.

On the other hand, as someone who doesn't yet see himself as a full professional in this regard, I wouldn't throw away any TAK-653 solution if I stored it at cool(room) temperature for less than 3 months",1708191265,kqv6p32,t3_1at4dk0,t3_1at4dk0,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

neuro__atypical,"It literally says the opposite:

> AMPA receptor **agonists** are likely not viable for clinical applications as they present a risk of inducing seizures and overexcitation-induced neurotoxicity at doses close to their therapeutic window.[7][8][9] TAK-653 **possesses minimal direct AMPA agonist properties.**[7] TAK-653 provides **a 419 fold safety margin** against convulsions relative to therapeutic doses in rats.[7]

Emphasis added by me. TAK-653's agonist activity is so minuscule it's irrelevant.",1708203847,kqw8xea,t3_1at4dk0,t1_kqw5sav,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
