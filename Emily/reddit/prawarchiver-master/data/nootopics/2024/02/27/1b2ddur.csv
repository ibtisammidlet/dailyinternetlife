Efik_Pail,"Hello,
My rodent likes it.
My rodent is a bit stimulated, vapes much less during the day and is a bit more focused. 
When i talked with my rodent, he did not mention any side effects.
According to him, it's a subtle but efficient and very safe Nootropic.",1709204595,ksogc4n,t3_1b2ddur,t3_1b2ddur,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,"Been on it for a month 2 mg every ~3-4 days. Pros: slight stimulation, mild cognitive enhancement. Cons: find myself out of breath in situations I wouldn’t normally be out of breath, I took it before working out once and felt very out of breath and like my BP was up. That’s why I take it sporadically, and after I work out. 

Sometimes it seems for a couple hours after I take ABT-089 I’m stimulated but not experiencing cognitive enhancement, and then later in the day, maybe 4-6 hrs later, I notice improved cognition, but no stimulation. Sometimes I stack with Tropisetron and I’d say they go well together.",1709173900,ksmyeu6,t3_1b2ddur,t3_1b2ddur,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"It's possibly related to cholinergic bronchoconstriction, which really bothered me during experiments with Donepezil and Huperzine A. I'm still going to try ABT-089 but this doesn't sound good. One way to try to ameliorate this is Salbutamol, but that brings its own issues.

Curiously I have the same bronchoconstriction with AMPA PAMs like TAK-653 and IDRA-21. Did you also try those and did you have breathing issues as well? Really sucks because I like TAK a lot.",1709281515,kstqirm,t3_1b2ddur,t1_ksmyeu6,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
stabbedbyresonance,Never tried TAK or IDRA so I can’t say. This is interesting though and good to know about. Didn’t realize this was a thing.,1709393994,kt0gj1v,t3_1b2ddur,t1_kstqirm,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
