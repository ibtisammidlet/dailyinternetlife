Mikstradamus,"Well as a heavy smoker for about 15 years or so, I can easily tel you it does make people lazy but not only lazy it makes you content with not doing shit and I think that’s why many people stay with it because it has that special ingredient in it called “fuck it”. I live in Canada and it’s completely legal here now and I’ve noticed people who used to call people losers for smoking weed are now smoking weed. I think every weed head knows they would be more productive without it. Personally I love it though, I love the taste, smell and it enhanced my life at times although I feel like I wasted or missed opportunities in my life because I would rather sit at home and smoke. I smoke entirely way too much but it’s what I’m used to. But everybody’s going to react differently to it, my body absolutely loves it I know I’m addicted and prolly will never quit",1709054576,ksehuzb,t3_1b1fccm,t3_1b1fccm,49,False,t5_4aoxhu

longshotforyourlove,"It has only been until recently that science has discovered that people who have a family history of mental illness or latent mental illness are at a huge risk of developing serious mental health problems like schizophrenia from marijuana use. It’s just not actually that safe to use; EVERYONE has at least a couple people in their family with mental health issues which means that also EVERYONE is at risk of developing or exacerbating one via marijuana use.

My best friend of over 10 years only ever smoked marijuana, grew his own & only smoked his own. He made his money selling to medical only dispensaries and was trusted in that world for the quality of his weed. He developed schizophrenia from smoking weed too much, too often, and for far too many years. He committed suicide by stripping himself naked and walking across the freeway to be hit by a semi truck. He left his clothes folded on the side of the road. 

I have had a handful of friends become bipolar, panic disorder, schizophrenia, etc. and all they ever did drugs wise was marijuana. Another friend of mine tried to bleed himself dry because they were convinced we replaced their blood with cough syrup after giving them some to help them with a cold they had developed after running around town all night bare naked.

zachary6227,"THC makes many people lazy and unmotivated (albeit some people do have more productivity with it). It is an easy source of dopamine that requires little effort.

THC is detrimental for sleep quality and short term memory. 

Physically speaking smoking Cannabis is not good for lung health. Cannabis usage is correlated with cardiovascular issues.

CBD has a bunch of benefits which can help offset some of the detrimental effects of THC.

It’s the same argument for consuming caffeine on a daily basis or taking amphetamines like Adderall.

I think people actually overthink it, instead of just using it and chilling out they get all in their head about how high they are, kind of the opposite of how people are with alcohol and stimulants.

I actually think it’s great for exercise, which people might find surprising because it is associated with laziness but I would say it actually is associated with continuity/endurance. Like if you have some on the couch and don’t get up you might stay on the couch all day, but if you just get up and start moving you might keep moving for hours. 

It is certainly not a nootropic in the traditional sense. I don’t think it’s good for things like math or articulating linear arguments. It is however great for creativity enhancement and editing work that has already been partially flushed out. Memory effects seem to vary overall if you pay close enough attention and have a good enough memory in the first place it might not block your memory in a noticeable way but it certainly dampens memory formation.

Basically people look down on weed cause they are prejudiced, due to a mixture of factors including their own fear filled experiences with it, stoners in their lives not being able to find the balance and overusing and then over sharing about their overuse, and overall lack of a culture that knows how and when to use weed for productivity purposes.

SnooDrawings2997,"I agree with your statement on enhancing sensory! Music, going for walks, meditation, yoga, and intimacy are my favorite sensory experiences with cannabis.

I find if I use cannabis after therapy, I’ll continue processing, make connections, and have emotional releases— it’s been an effective tool in conjunction with therapy. I do think intention helps!

Also, I have an awful condition called MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) and cannabis edibles/tinctures are a miracle medicine in that regard. I personally love high ratio CBG, CBN, or CBD to low THC. I find regular low doses help treat multiple symptoms like systemic pain, nausea, anxiety, stress, restlessness/irritability, insomnia, muscle tension, depression, food aversion—  higher doses for flare ups/attacks. It also helps heal the gut and calm the nervous system. If you can get your medical license and speak with a cannabis informed practitioner (or do your own research) to find what strains, cannabanoids, terpenes, dosing protocol, is best for you, it can bring about many health and QoL benefits! —obviously it’s very stigmatized, and some people do not mesh well with it.

Conflict-Solid,"You are not hearing detail in songs or giving yourself sensory clarity.  No such thing as causing your brain to miss fire = enhancement.

Brain miss firing does = susceptible to delusions.

&#x200B;

Look at Emergency room visits in legalized countries before and after.   Admittance to psychiatric wards has doubled.

&#x200B;

The enhancement you think you are getting, is the increase of neurotransmitter signalling in the brain, because Weed has a stimulant effect, think along the lines of caffeine, amphetamine, SSRI and cocaine.

&#x200B;

But the effect is short lived, and follows up with a generally minor depressive like crash, and a few days to a week of poor mental clarity, as your body works to dislodge and dispose of the THC molecules that just got stuck in the layers of fat in your brain.

This is also why pot heads become couch potato's.  That boost you get is followed by a crash as your brain slams on the brakes to your neurotransmitters in a attempt to undo the damage your just caused by over stimulation.  It's this over stimulation that you think is improved sensory, it's not.  It's a deception.  You want improved sensory? Eat a apple, get some sleep and get physically fit and exercise.

Now if you smoke way to much, It can trigger panic attacks and anxiety, then you are in a world of shit, as you have to quit using and it can take again a few days to a few weeks to resolve and now you are looking at a depressive crash and all the nasty shit that comes with depression.

CBD on the other hand, is praised in some scientific circles and has multiple benefits. Hemp is praised in some environmental circles and also receives heavy praise.

PaleontologistNo5861,"well it depends on the demographic of who is looking down on cannabis... I've grown and bred cannabis since I was 14, since the glut of overproduction and the way business is run I've stepped away and just grow for myself- it did cause a craze for me that eventually turned me into a state certified horticulturist, one of the most respected in Cambridge mass, people compare the herb I was growing to ""the crazy stuff out of Amherst in the 90's""  I've lived through the days of northern lights Aks and hazes to the Kush and Sour era of the early 00's to the often disappointing MACs and GMOs of nowadays, ill leave it on the shelf man..

The reason society looks down on it is the psyop program from anslinger on- pre DEA, cannabis was used in the states as more of a textile and natural resource for oil, then as the smoking and integration of people started, the racism reared its ugly head. you see, jazz clubs were getting popular and it's unclear who thought to smoke cannabis flower, but tobacco was being smoked regularly and cultivated for such, certain  jazz clubs were a hot spot for smoked cannabis in the 30's. The counter culture is the true fear propelled by the government.

We must realize, cannabis allows people to be much more understanding and open to one another's ideas and positions by allowing ourselves a new prospective into it that is lent by a cannabis high. Think in a pre MLK world where if you were white you were looked down on by your peers for hanging with the blacks.. this is literally the root of perception for ""looking down"" on cannabis users. it was the early integration with cannabis as being a lead perpetuator, to be comfortable hanging out with people that are nothing like yourself only to discover you are more alike than you first thought. the fear and divisiveness that propels governmental propaganda is torn apart by the seams of conscious construct.

you must realize when it comes to science, every scientist that is beyond institutional study has either joined a private sector that is ingrained with the government or are a government contractor themself (if you are doing anything worthwhile in terms of technological advancement). When cannabis was studied by medical professionals (even some with heavy bias) they usually end up with positive results, there is even history of results being sealed from the public or altered to reflect a negative impact of cannabis yet the government has a patent on cannabinoids being a neuro-protectant, how could this be?

it circles back to government control, the counter culture that is so widely based and diverse the federal government can not put cannabis users in a box which is probably worrisome, and of course the veil lifted by propaganda, in a similar way to shrooms the connections being made in the brain are new and connect parts that usually do not 'communicate'  this bridge with the subconscious mind is something largely unexplored- I recall a few years ago seeing psychologists studies on the shrinking of the frontal lobe accompanied with a heavy increase of gray matter in the brain of heavy cannabis users. 

MK-ultra was a real study from the CIA to search for a mind control/truth serum. Many different substances went through vigorous testing for their psychological effects from the viewpoint of extracting information. This had to be the nail in the coffin for the government perception of cannabis as a threat... we like to say, oh how dangerous could cannabis be, Doritos and couch potatoes- this is why the business of indicas are booming because the government has no qualms with a plant that makes you lazy- but what about that cannabis that makes you nervous and anxious, you can't stand still lol what about cannabis Sativa? I can picture a soldier being interrogated while high and asking questions, lightheartedly- making the interviewer feel insecure in what they actually know, instead of being fed any information there might've been the reverse- dangerous to a government that prefers dividing and sweeping any flaws and poorly perceived public views under the rug.",1709135854,ksjtmx4,t3_1b1fccm,t3_1b1fccm,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Efik_Pail,"Neither pro nor anti weed, I'll just add my experience here (which is obviously only anecdotal, but many solid studies have been posted above, by Friedrich_Ux for example)

I tried some low doses of weed some years ago and various doses of HHC when HHC used to be legal in my country. (10 to 25 mg of HHC, oral way)

It was...meh...each time it was a bit of fun (appreciation of taste, music...but it  lowered my capacity to analyse music. Sex was kinda weird but not bad taking HHC), but it also caused anxiety, slight dissociation, laziness, dry eyes and mouth, bad sleep...I'd say each time, the experience was not extremely pleasant for me and was clearly anti-cognitive.

For sleep, CBD+CBN oil (no THC) is not too bad, quite well rounded, bit there are many more interesting and more specialized compounds on the market. (You will be better served by Melatonin + Carnosic Acid, I think)

It lay be interesting for a recreational use for people who tolerate it well (it must be or it would not be so common), but as far as I am concerned, there are tons of more reliable Nootropics, for anxiety (many racetams, Selank, Bromantane, Rhodiola if you don't use synthetics) , logical thinking (Noopept, Tak-653) or for sensory enhancement (Neboglamine)...your milage may vary (it most certainly will), but as far as I'm concerned, it has no interest for pro-cognitive effect and for anti anxiety, there are so many compounds which will do the job in a much more selective way and with much less side effects.",1709138271,ksk0vea,t3_1b1fccm,t3_1b1fccm,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

ConvenienceStoreDiet,"Probably a few things. I live in the USA and while we're not a monolith, we're a country built upon strict religious values among many other things. So I'll give a few perspectives from here.

Usually people smoke it and we know smoking is pretty bad for people. 

Stoners don't get the most glamorous rep. People look at people who do it too much as the types who have smoked themselves stupid. And those who do it because it's legal may think it's safe, so they'll smoke while doing shit like driving or at work. Or they may be able to function on it or not give a shit, then just do it all the time regardless of consequence to others.

In the USA, we understand now it was banned for reasons outside of its effects. But that part of the culture of, ""it's a drug, drugs are bad"" is still a part of the world.

There's the capitalist part of the USA that's dangerous. It's that people will market and sell it to anyone to get high. ""Feel things better."" ""Live life better."" ""Fix depression and anxiety."" Some term like that. And that's not the experience for everyone for every strain and so on. It's selling a drug to people. Have them buy it and use it regularly, regardless of its effects, to pretend that it fulfills a need that it doesn't. For some it may help. For others, it may give the illusion of helping when really it's selling.

Not everyone does great on weed or has the same effects. Some people may find pain relief. I have met a few people with eating problems who sometimes have to hit their CBD vape just to eat. Others may find paranoia. As my psychology professor put it, ""it just makes you lazy."" A buddy of mine put it best. ""I smoked so much weed for a year and then saw I got nothing done, so I stopped."" It's not some miracle cure-all or life enhancer that people would like to make it out to be. It can be those things. But it's not the fix. And for people looking to reduce anxiety, it's a bit of treating the symptoms vs getting to the root of the problems. And it may be in conjunction with things like CBT, meditation/mindfulness, or other therapies to help.

Also, we live in a fairly puritanical society in the USA. ""It's better than alcohol"" is met sometimes with ""doesn't make it better."" A lot of society here still looks at imbibing, especially the ascetic religious followers, as morally inappropriate.

Also, it's illegal, so many will follow the law and even believe the lawful rule is there for a moral reason. So people will see it still as drugs are bad.

Many will look at psychoactive drugs as a way to open experiences, when for many things like mindfulness, meditation, may be able to offer other ways to achieve an openness that's desired through it. It's like many will use any physical substance to achieve a goal that can be achieved without. Like people needing alcohol to have fun or be loose when one can lower their own inhibitions without it.

Just different perspectives on it all. Doesn't invalidate your experiences and you may feel yours are valid. There are plenty of people who will agree and plenty who won't.",1709148633,kskx3z8,t3_1b1fccm,t3_1b1fccm,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Sweatok10kjd,"I certainly understand how one could easily accept the ""pitfalls"" of THC/CBD usage. I found out pretty quickly that it helped me fall asleep (buzzed my body up so that I could relax without a racing mind). Later, it became my source of dopamine for when I didn't need to do anything for 12 hours (would wake up feeling drowsy up to 12 hours after smoking). I was not in a good headspace, and my environment (work and home) did not help me see the positives.


Eventually, I started experiencing the paranoia many people mention they start getting in their late 20's (I'm 28). I also was in the middle of some spiritual awakening processes, so I started paying attention during my highs, identifying ""negative"" thoughts. During my sober time, I had also decided THC was great for helping me focus on meditating (though the sluggish brain sometimes distracted me from a string of thoughts), and I learned how to alchemize my fears/negative thoughts into positive ones that still kept the intentions (for example, I did not think I would be a great pet owner, and someone had come up with an observation that was equal and opposite to my statement). So when I noticed paranoid thoughts pop up, I would practice flipping the script.


Eventually, my spiritual awakening in my mind sped up as I started experiencing thought patterns similar to bi-polar manic (paranoia+pronoia). I kept following what felt good (epiphanies and revelations that caused my chest to feel lighter everytime I ""made a new connection""). One night, I had even thought I meshed consciousnesses with one of my friends who lives 2 hours away. I played it out, but definitely felt very disoriented afterwards. My other friends were concerned, of course, because it looked a lot like a schizophrenic episode, yet, I knew it was all in my head, for I was paying attention to it the entire time, trying to use thought-alchemy to get out of it.


A few weeks later, I got my wisdom teeth taken out, so I was off the THC/CBD vape for a while. I started up again after 2 weeks from the removal. My head would still swarm with thoughts that I considered to be spiritual, analyzing shows I would watch while high to learn more about my authentic self (especially if the universe is a reflection of my perception). By then, I had decided I'd only use THC to induce dreams (on/off routine), recreationally if I had All of my needs and sober wants done, and for meditation to remove any creative blocks I'm not aware of.


I feel functionally fine. Almost back to normal (memory isnt back yet, but thats because the relevance hasnt built up yet, am in transition). There's many many other factors that could explain what happened to me, but I am satisfied with how that journey went for me. Since then, I've been listening to other spiritual-awakening videos, collecting more puzzle pieces to decide on, playing chess with my resources, and have sought out other creative ways to connect with myself like using astrology houses to organize my yearly goals, tarot for sub-conscious thought provocation, the Human Design chart for how I want to respond to life, and am looking into bone-throwing for non-serious yes/no questions about my life for things that I don't think will matter.


I controlled a lot of my life and oppressed myself, and I feel the most whole I've felt in my life. I grew up Christian Lutheran/Non-denominational, and my whole life I just wanted to meet God. As far as my left brain goes, I have. He and I were one and the same the whole time, but I didn't realize it because everyone else made Him sound like some ""other"" that I had no say in how my life was suppose to go. Now I realize that all beliefs come from God (via the mathematical transitive property: if [religion](specifically spirituality, which is different) comes from man, and man comes from Source/God/OTP, then ALL spiritual beliefs are from God). 


Everything has a purpose, and most people don't realize they have the power to assign a specific purpose (boundary) for tools like money, drugs, etc. So I can see and understand how easily one could have negative experiences or end up ""settling"" in their life (though I also recognize some people truly do not want to chase their higher goals because stability and comfortability are still needed in their life). 


So to answer your question with what I know now, people look down on weed because they believe the stigmas and stereotypes over their own experiences, and it's not just limited to weed and drugs. Anytime someone feels trapped or stuck, I think there's a possibility they have the veil of disbelief preventing them from crossing over into whatever it is they truly want. Things change over time and adapt, including the old lessons people have collected over the years. People also just see the ""cost"" of using weed (natural consequences from chemical reactions) and are unwilling to shift around their resources to accommodate for it, and that is valid as well because sometimes people just have responsibilities that are not as flexible as those with less responsibilities. 


If you're up for being the pioneer, I believe in you.

cheesebugz,"Part of it is marketing/societal brainwashing. Part of it because in truth a lot of people who spend all day smoking are idiots.

I am a user but my ex fiance used to be a heavy one too. Every time he got high something somewhat dangerous would always happen. Usually broken glasses or leaving the oven open, while it’s on, etc. Then one week I had to travel for work. While I was gone, he decided to give my dog a bath in the tub to surprise me with a clean little furdude when I got home. Well when I got home, my dog was “bathed”. He was still slick with shampoo and conditioner that wasn’t rinsed off, and his skin was bright red— had to take him to the vet immediately because he was having a skin reaction the the products being on his skin for so long. The floor was soaked all through the hallway and to the front door, because in the process my ex also forgot to turn the tub off. He also couldn’t keep a job and hopped between five in the span of a year because he was always high and forgetful.

Weed just isn’t for everyone’s brain. And the bad examples stand out the most. We don’t see the dentists and doctors who smoke. I was so physically incapacitated by my illness before weed— I had to quit school, quit my job, basically quit my life because I couldn’t even sit in bed and watch TV without being in excruciating pain. Now after weed I’m finishing up my bachelors and about to apply for masters programs immediately after. And back to work of course. I get to enjoy all my hobbies and have a fun, colorful life again without pain. 

I’m pretty open about using weed, but a lot of people who use weed and have positive responses or zero negative life effects simply aren’t loud about it. In public most of the examples of users we see are the people who take foreverrrrrr in line to order food and then talk and laugh during movies. That being said, if you can stand to not inconvenience others I do encourage smoking before watching a movie.

Bc I love cannabis, I easily can start back on a daily habit if I don’t watch it. 
The side effects come for me strong if I’ve been smoking daily tho! The munchies are the worst, I almost can’t turn them off. For pain, initially (just like productivity) it helps but with EVERYDAY use FOR ME, it increases my pain levels and I suspect it’s increasing inflammation. After I detox at least 4 days, bloating goes down & pain goes back down. Now this could be related to those late night munchies as I don’t snack late normally. I find contradicting studies on if it reduces or increases inflammation so it’s hard to know for sure. 
For my anxiety on a daily basis, I have to stick to using Magnesium. I like Magnesium Breakthrough  as it’s got a little bit of 7 different forms of Mg. It’s perfect for my stress during the day and I take a larger dose to help me sleep. 
I won’t abandon cannabis completely, but I do have lots of memory issues when I use it daily. 
For me, it’s my weekend “cocktail”. If I use it ONCE a week, I get stoned every time easily. I don’t find that it will interfere in productivity and little to no memory effects. 
***I personally never smoke before any type of work situation. I feel like I’m trying to cheat my employer if I do that. I also can’t talk to people as relaxed as I am sober so it’s a no-go to mix work with weed. I work with sharp objects also I have to be FULLY AWARE of everything I’m doing at all times. ***
Now when I use it weekly, I feel inspired & productive every time. If it becomes a daily habit, it reverses and I get the “fuck its” easily. I don’t drink often at all. Last year I had maybe ten drinks total. I love my vices but not more than I love myself and I have to remind myself of this as this entire post is almost triggering me now. 
I don’t know if any of that is useful/helpful but that’s my experience. I have to have a balanced life and not feel deprived or I can to overcompensate in other areas. I’m not saying smoking once weekly is good for anyone else, but that is what works for me at this time in my life. 🫶🏻",1709252726,kss2uee,t3_1b1fccm,t3_1b1fccm,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu

MusksLeftPinkyToe," I mean, it sounds like I'm repeating myself so many times in this thread, but I admit that weed has issues. The part I'm not understanding is how are people just... unbothered by the relevation, you know? Say, you go to a wine tasting, and the sommelier is telling you about all these flavors in the wine. You sip it, and it just tastes like another sour grape juice. You pretend you got it all, but inside you wonder if they're all just faking it? Are they all a bunch of pretentious assholes huffing their own verbal farts? Maybe you google some studies done about how wine tasters got tricked into appraising a wine as red by simply dying it. You ask some friends and they say that you just have to keep at it and practice - the same cope they have about intelligence.

 Then you take some THC. And suddenly, the world has opened up. You can taste all these features the sommelier described. Hell, you don't even need him. You can just find some random wine and make your own tasting notes. It's not that you were ever inarticulate or hampered by inexperience, you were simply ""taste blind"". Before, it really was just sour grape juice to you - you simply had no initial material to work with. 

 How is that not one of the most amazing things? How can anyone stand just going back into the darkness, knowing there is all this real stuff out there that is hidden from you everywhere you go? How can you keep living knowing that there are people out there who were just born perceiving so much more with their senses? How does it not gnaw at your mind to realize that just as you, with your intelligence, can understand concepts which elude others, so can these people navigate sensory reality with precision, adroitness and ease that will ever elude you in your baseline state?

CollarNo7911,"I appreciate your curiosity! I have a history of being successfully academically and professionally (student and employee) and after 2 months of thc I became fully non functional was having delusions and hallucinations and the only substance I had abused was thc for the span of about 2 months (I was a first timer and it was a maladaptive coping mechanism to grief after loss). 

I stopped showing up to work, became clinically insane, and had to visit the hospital 3 times and had many concerned family and friends some of which who don't see me the same anymore - some of which who said my disorderly self and erratic behavior traumatized them. 

I had a diagnosis of an MI after using, and that pretty much wrote off the beginning of the end of my life.

It's been 2 years since then, and I'm still grappling with everything I lost. This would have been my graduation year for my masters program had I not delved into substances and acted a fool.

Self-love and self forgiveness have been a priority for me in therapy, but I gotta tell you, it's ain't easy.

Biggest regret of my life, and I still haven't recovered from the psychological damage it did and the reputation of mine - I utterly destroyed.

Wake up? Smoke a bowl. Have work 2 hours later? If I didn't have that second bowl to smoke my entire workday would seem off. 

 Counterpoint? Even if I DID have that second bowl to smoke, my workday would be off as I'd be all paranoid about my red eyes and getting clocked, likely have the munchies and get preoccupied with food until finally eating at lunchtime but hey, can't just smoke in the lunchroom at work godda go off and find a place to smoke which meant my vehicle or the woods and lunch would be about over by the time I finished.

For many it’s habitual and for many it’s chemically pleasing.

I am confident because most anecdotes are pretty in line with this in the real world. Most don't and they end up being put on a lower trajectory in life. I'm not saying it's impossible to benefit from that I'm just saying it's very rare for a variety of reasons be it genetic or your personality of how you use it. Studies generally back this up as well as well (negative effects). Of course there's no real way to actually factually say that, but if we just look at it scientifically, it's not good for most people, especially long term, and outside of pain management.

I mean personally if I divide all the people I know consume versus the ones that don't there's a pretty clear answer there, but I'm also aware that there are people online that do fine, could they do better, sure, are they at their best... hmmm idk. 

It's a kind of wisdom that normal people in real life have. Most successful adults out there aren't weeded out, and you know that the average person especially the average young person isn't going to be like a coder or hacker or something where weed helps them if they're even predisposed to that. Most people use it in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons and it hurts them, and they don't even realize it so they'll go out of their way to go on the internet or talk to other people and just boast about that constantly which is a stereotype. 

It's a net negative the more people are exposed to it. Yes you can benefit, but 9/10 you're not that kind of person to. 

My main point with the creative Fields thing was that a lot of people hype themselves up to be so great and they'll do all these drugs to try and enhance their performance or creativity but it it doesn't really end up working out because it's difficult to do so.

EVERYONE I worked with (in very respectable and high paying positions) admitted to using, and they are some of the most productive, successful, motivated people I know. I also met a group of folks back in my college days who dropped out, and all they did was smoke weed. I've seen both ""reactions"" to the stuff, and all it says to me is that generalizations are useless. It's like technology - tech in and of itself isn't bad, but it can be used in both bad and good ways. 

It's like anything else. People often make bad decisions when it comes to ANY substance (caffeine, sugar). No one is going this hard on those things, even though A LOT of ppl are addicted to both, probably because both of them support the daily grind and that's seen as a ""good"" thing.

I use. Sure, my memory has taken a dive a bit, but I also got promoted recently, started a YouTube channel, and I'm in the best shape of my life thanks to an *increased motivation* to exercise. As someone who is always in my head, it has helped me be more connected with my body and the sensory gifts the OP mentioned.

Example being alcohol.   1-2 drinks (5-10mg equivalent) probably wont do TOO much damage, but 10-20 drinks (50-100mg) will definitely.  I am not sure why anyone would think THC is much different even if it can't kill you.",1709134234,ksjopft,t3_1b1fccm,t1_ksgaql3,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

TrenAppreciator420,"None of this really matters since I'm bigger and taller than you but I'll bite. Your life is so bereft of meaning and purpose that you post about GTA and red dead redemption on reddit, after the age of 21, gaming should be no more than a very very occasional hobby, you should be working on your career and/or socialising, training, developing skills etc. So, given that you don't appear to be doing any of the things a man should be doing, from this we can infer that you're likely a socially inept couch-potato man-child who has no real hobbies, skills or athletic talent, nor have you likely ever done any martial art or combat sport let alone had a fist-fight. Let me guess, unemployed too?

Keep indulging in the fantasy where you are somehow the one who is capable of smacking anyone around, but I know for a fact that if you saw me in real life you'd not even be able to maintain eye contact, I have worked to afford myself the luxury of knowing for a fact I could slap your jaw off of your face, absolutely bizarre the self-delusion people like you are capable of, yet you want to claim that all the hallucinogens etc you never shut the fuck up about have somehow calmed your ego down. Imagine being one of these guys and yet having less self-awareness than a tren-abuser lmaooooo huge Ls for you all-round.

I've been a shotter in my younger years so even when I was 15 you'd have been losing at your own game by being one of the junkies giving their social welfare to me, you are and will always be a loser in every aspect of your life.

Edit: You also said ""I guarantee your little bitch"", you mean ""you're"", as in ""you are""? Evidently I'm also more intelligent than you too since you can't grasp very basic English.",1709175371,ksn25x2,t3_1b1fccm,t1_ksir2fz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Weed is good for me, although I don’t get blasted I just smoke two bowls a day.  One if it’s a workday when I’m done with work.

But it's pretty clear that for every successful user there's like, I don't know, 9 other irresponsible users that are getting less than what they put into it out of it. There's nothing wrong with focusing on the good and successful and popular users but they paid a picture that isn't reflective of the reality. 

Genetics plays a huge role in the various mechanisms thc will do to you, on the hole it's bad for most people, but everyone takes it differently. check out r/leaves",1709125140,ksj1gj2,t3_1b1fccm,t1_kshue4z,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
