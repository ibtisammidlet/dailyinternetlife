 And I do understand the perspective. The memory deficits induced by THC really do make it a hard sell as a cognitive enhancer. But what about the incredible enhancement of sensory clarity? The detail you hear in songs when you're high is real. The flavors you taste in food are real. The body language you notice when you're high is real. THC reveals so many more objects in your conscious experience that you can reason about. It's really so revealing how often the bottleneck of effective cognition is not a lack of ability to draw correct and interesting inferences but a lack of material to apply it to.

 Many a stack and nootropic have as their goal to get the motivation and mental acceleration of stimulants without paying a steep price in tolerance and neurotoxicity. But it seems there is not even the slightest interest in what can be done to have THC-level sensory clarity without the shot memory.
