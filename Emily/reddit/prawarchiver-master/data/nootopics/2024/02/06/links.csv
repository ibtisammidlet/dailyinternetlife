Why are sarcosine sellers so rare? Yet it is a substance that is even included in the composition of many cosmetic products.

I thought about ordering from the USA but I don't like the package being blocked at customs or having to wait a few months for it to arrive.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Sarcosine shortage,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1al9jnt/sarcosine_shortage/

Felt great, reduced anxiety symptoms from the coffee, better focus, etc.

&#x200B;

I decided to cut the coffee as I wanted to get out of my caffeine habit. I continued taking the L-theanine at 200-400mg a day due to my diagnosed anxiety (GAD & SAD). A couple/few days after stopping the daily 1-2 coffees, I had a huge depressive spiral--several crying spells a day, guilt/regret over numerous things in my life, lots of anxiety, etc.--even though I am on an antidepressant called Nardil, which is an MAOI.

&#x200B;

I quit the L-theanine in hopes I would go back to normal and added L-tryptophan\* to see if that could re-start me being happier. In a couple days, I was back to my old self and all of the depressive spiral symptoms went away.

&#x200B;

(Why did I add L-tryptophan? I found online that L-tryptophan can help augment MAOIs to improve response and potentially kickstart them again when/if they ""poop out"". I was in such a bad place I was scared the L-theanine had fucked up my response to Nardil, so I grabbed L-tryptophan in hopes it would help.)

&#x200B;

Now, I am not sure why L-theanine ultimately did this to me--or if it was the cause of my depressive spiral. I would love to learn more about L-theanine and its pharmacology as it relates to my response.

&#x200B;

I feel like I remember reading one time it has effects on serotonin (serotonin is linked to depression) and glutamate (which is anxiety inducing right as it's the opposite of GABA)??

&#x200B;

Was it the L-theanine without caffeine that caused my brain to react so differently in contrast to my great response to L-theanine+caffeine and thus cause me to have a depressive spiral?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Why did L-Theanine send me into a depressive episode?
