fruiop,Some people report “withdrawal” when quitting caffeine; I didn’t see that you mentioned that as a possibility.,1707281662,kpagnp5,t3_1akuwco,t3_1akuwco,9,False,t5_4aoxhu

mariners90,"The brain chemistry aspect of it is confusing to me, but I had a very similar. I’m not on any antidepressants, but after a week on theanine I had massive anxiety, insomnia, depression etc. It went away after being off theanine a week.",1707347680,kpelecl,t3_1akuwco,t3_1akuwco,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
anthem21x,"L-theanine allegedly reduces dopamine release in the brain striatum which involves motivation/ reward. As long as you’re on the caffeine then this isn’t a problem because caffeine increases that flow. 

Could be a combination of this plus stopping caffeine cold turkey. 

If you’re getting off caffeine, stop the l-theanine as well.

I suggest taking GABA and adrenal support adaptogen supplements (e.g. ashwaganda, rhodiola rosea etc) to help combat anxiety.",1707284806,kpamhwd,t3_1akuwco,t3_1akuwco,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

IncreasinglyTrippy,L-theanine is an NMDA antagonist and can cause depersonalization like states. For me taking not a large amount for not that long of a time causes me to feel detached and stuck in my head.,1707330314,kpd5wqw,t3_1akuwco,t3_1akuwco,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,I've thought that too when used. Nowedays I have supplements that happen to contain it and Im not depressed anymore. It could somehow be that it can on its own in a certain dose do this to some people.,1707597520,kptvp9x,t3_1akuwco,t3_1akuwco,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
NinjaNuclear,"Theanine *increases* dopamine in the striatum as best as I can find for what it's worth.

Theanine can cause some funky stuff with knocking glutamate off NMDA afaik (partial NMDA agonism) - trying a few different forms of magnesium with it could be quite helpful.",1707289066,kpataos,t3_1akuwco,t1_kpamhwd,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Complete_Still7584,"Sorry man, but gaba is one of the most misunderstood money grab supplements. Gaba's molecule is too big to cross the blood brain barrier.

NinjaNuclear,"Both things can be true at once. The effect for you could simply be due to something else. One possibility is an attenuation of the cortisol spike from caffeine or reducing the impact of caffeine on glutamate.

I'm just pointing out that it's not likely through decreasing dopamine in the striatum when no available evidence (at least that I know of) shows that and instead seems to show the opposite.",1707292598,kpayd2i,t3_1akuwco,t1_kpawj4o,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
