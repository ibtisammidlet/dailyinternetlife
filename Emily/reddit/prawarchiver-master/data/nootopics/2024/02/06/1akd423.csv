After 3 months, positive results of the neuropsychological examination were reported in both groups.

I have been in the nootropics community for over a decade and have worked within the industry, and the problem is far worse than most people understand.

So yes, I pay at times more with ND for the benefit of knowing the purity and proper dosages is actually what I’m buying. 

With random brands on Amazon, there is A: no guarantee it’s even what they claim it is, and B: you always have to check the dosages on the bottle. The price per pill Amazon displays is notoriously inaccurate a lot of the time. 

For example, a product may say $0.17 per pill, and ND maybe $0.30 per pill. Then, you see the dosage on the label is 500mg with a serving size of two pills. But ND may have 500mg per pill. So ND would be cheaper by $0.04, and you have the peace of mind that the quality is there.

Look, I have no affiliation with ND. One of my clients is a competitor for one of their Natrium-brand products. Yet, I still buy ND for everything else because I’ve seen behind the scenes that very few companies are doing things correctly in this industry.

onyxengine,"Kratom is habituating, and can be difficult to kick but its not nicotine/heroine levels addiction.  Everything has a gradient. Im sure most US users who take kratom have dabbled in and kicked or been straight up addicted to harder stuff.  

Telling people kratom is not addictive or habituating at all isn’t accurate.  Its safer than most things, and is even a fairly manageable addiction.  But too much kratom can cause issues.  You shouldn’t be telling people kratom had no capacity to addict users its simply false.

There needs to be personal responsibility. Every drug addict ever will cry a river about how their choices aren’t their fault, and guess what? One of the first steps of recovery is taking ownership over your own choices.

Acceptable_Stuff1381,"Phenibut IS legal and is a cure for anxiety, it just also is super addictive. Pretty sure it’s prescribed in Russia, but I might be thinking of tia. 

They sell phenibut at a headshop near me, they also sell it at a bodybuilding shop by me in a workout stack.  It’s not a banned chemical yet. (But it likely will be) 

I agree with you knowingly lying about a product is wrong and that should draw consequences, but if you made your way to nootropic depot and bought it but didn’t look up its addiction profile, risks, people’s experiences, interactions, etc. that’s also on you. As far as I know they weren’t advertising it as a magic cure with no addictive properties, were they? 

And regarding McDonald’s and stuff, they never advertise that stuff as healthy, everyone knows it’s dogshit food but it’s cheap and people love it. You can’t save anyone from themselves if they refuse to make any effort to save themselves ",1707266846,kp9gzxt,t3_1akd423,t1_kp9e1l6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
