Thus it is cheap(/potent) and long lasting (even the pro-cognitive effects!)

Legitimate_Banana512,"What do you mean with this exactly? Rapastinel is a positive allosteric modulator of nmda at a novel site apart from the glycine site (such as neboglamine). 

It's antidepressent effects could be compared to ketamine(nmda antagonist), but it works through a different mechanism, which is kind of the polar opposite of nmda antagonism in some ways.

Thus it likely comes without the downsides of nmda antagonism, _maybe_ even may help more by reversing deficits after ketamine abuse",1707834977,kq8jido,t3_1apaoq5,t1_kq7ve44,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Hmm, I think it must be due to a lack of studies or as a person said because this one is not orally active, Zelquistinel is (very recently developed)

I just named this one because you can find more information about it in principle, and than look farther/optimize as you wish.

Maybe /u sirsadalot would like to give a second try/look",1707853880,kqa2e40,t3_1apaoq5,t1_kq8odh6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Synthesis for all -stinels is notoriously difficult, so unless it is picked up by a major company prices are going to be unfeasible. There was some trialing going on at Longecity back in 2016 and I believe results were rather disappointing. SAGE-718 looks more promising for enhancing cognition through NMDA than the -stinels in my opinion. For now I would stick to Nefiracetam or Neboglamine for enhancing NMDA receptor activity.",1707985905,kqic4p0,t3_1apaoq5,t1_kqey3iy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"I saw a study that illustrated it, but in that study (might be old already) they said it is basically a allosteric site like the glycine site, yet located at a different part of the nmda receptor (with very lromosing ligands in effects for nootropic/anti-depressent and indeed perhaps schizophrenia)",1707853987,kqa2psl,t3_1apaoq5,t1_kq98x2k,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Upset_Scientist3994,"What is so intresting here that that would be entirely new discovery in field of neuroscience, and arises question that what is endogenous neurotransmitter then going into that site? 

For NMDA glycine / D-serine  site it is either of those two neurotransmitters what naturally go there, and then Neboglamine or Nefiracetam are external substances what modulate that site (Nefiracetam of course does lot of other things as well).

I have some memory that amino acid alanine, or D-alanine mayby also could potentially affect NMDA receptor too, but dont remember if there was some particular site for that or receptor itself. If some particular site, could it be that....?",1707916563,kqdp8w5,t3_1apaoq5,t1_kqbsdly,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
