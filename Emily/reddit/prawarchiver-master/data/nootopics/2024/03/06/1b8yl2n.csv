Gwyavel,"Looking forward for independent forum board, censorship on Reddit is getting out of hands, last years were horrible in that regard. The only way to escape it is to have standalone platform.

stabbedbyresonance,I really donâ€™t understand why you receive this hate. Do the other noot companies do this to each other and every small shop as well?,1709831319,ktsgofz,t3_1b8yl2n,t3_1b8yl2n,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
DiegPosts,"ND has so much power through owning r/nootropics for years and having at least a 100 company affiliated accounts and likely more through their network. Mass reporting and controlling the dialogue to some extent is a part of their ( successful ) business strategy, a business that will only make millions more.

I mean we let people on Reddit talk about drugs and encourage each other to do obviously illegal and harmful drugs, but then we have situations like these where there's clear interference involved. May as well ban every ND and vendor account on reddit that's ever talked about their production process and standards lol.",1709831479,ktsh5ok,t3_1b8yl2n,t3_1b8yl2n,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Dbdbmama,"search for the title. you can still access the posts thru the nootopics sub but not thru his account. ...if your link has his account, they wont work.
