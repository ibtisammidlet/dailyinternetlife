Thanks to the pressure from you guys, the appeal quickly overturned the ban since literally nothing I've ever posted has been a violation of ToS. But this just goes to show that if you're not already on our discord, you really need to join. Here's another link for that: [https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp](https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp)

And I definitely need to speed up the development of [chatsci.com](https://chatsci.com). So if you want to be a part of that, message me (not on reddit).

If I had to guess, r/Nootropics was probably behind this. Good reason to doubt it being anyone else, and goes hand in hand with their recent activity.

**Original post:**

We have been growing rapidly and the r/Nootropics moderators and others are going to do all they can to stop what we are doing. Over the past couple years we've dealt with a ridiculous amount of reports raiding, bot nets, and numerous unjust bans, so this is hardly new but it's a big deal to be sure.

The discord is also likely going to be under attack, as historically it has been, but now there won't be anything to fall back on (yet). We need a good amount of support to move to our own social media designed for us that will be called [chatsci.com](https://chatsci.com), message us on discord if you are interested! And PS I will not accept some janky half-assed forum board, it needs to be good, so it will be a huge undertaking. I don't care about making money off it, so don't expect ads or weird subscriptions.

Basically this has been a long and drawn out competition to defend the true nootropics, legacy of Corneliu, our niche subculture, and freedom to continue things as it has been. But now we really need to come together or I promise it will all be lost in due time.

Just to truly explain what I've dealt with the past 2 years to try and keep things afloat:

\- Frequent DDoS attempts

\- Lost domain (due to njalla being awful)

\- Lost 3 payment processors

\- Lost 2 discord servers, almost lost the recent one

\- Almost lost the subreddit, almost lost my discord account (recently)- Lost u/sirsadalot which was a well known account

And more. So much more. This is not paranoia, it's my reality. Everything I've made is constantly being challenged. So if I can't own the social medias, like actually own them, then they will definitely be stolen.",False,t5_4aoxhu,u/sirsadalot banned - JOIN THE DISCORD ASAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1b8yl2n/usirsadalot_banned_join_the_discord_asap/
