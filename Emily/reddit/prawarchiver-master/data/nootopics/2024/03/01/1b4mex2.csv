skytouching,"Damn that‚Äôs a bad nic wd. I recently quit vaping up to three pods of 50 mg so up to 300 mg a day cold turkey. And before I started I was really concerned it was gonna be bad. But mostly just strong cravings for a week. And then I got home from vacation and started again just because I personally don‚Äôt really see any reason to stay abstinent.
Sorry‚Ä¶ that probably sounds like I‚Äôm just bragging.

If I were you I‚Äôd look into galantamine or consider a low dose patch.

I don‚Äôt have any studies to cite I‚Äôm sure there are some but I had planned on trying it if I were ever in your situation. There used to be a little talk about it on r/nootropics as well.

Here‚Äôs a segment of the wiki pharmacology section:

‚ÄúGalantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) Œ±4Œ≤2, Œ±3Œ≤4, and Œ±6Œ≤4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs Œ±7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain.[4][32] By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine.[22] This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released.[33] However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs Œ±4Œ≤2 or Œ±7 as a positive allosteric modulator.[34][35]

Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body.[4] By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's‚Äù

Based on that I always thought it‚Äôd be a solid remedy.

Anti-Dissocialative,"I would just eat a lot of eggs and take magnesium glycinate and l-theanine to keep your nervous system chill. Just stay away from modulating your ach directly. Exercise a lot. Eat healthy. Good fats, healthy protein & avoid processed carbs. Don‚Äôt go for the fancy stuff it might just make you even more agitated - number one thing is to be able to relax while your body normalizes - which it will normalize. Keep it up homie! I had fun with nicotine but getting off of it was one of the best choices I ever made! The right thing to do ain‚Äôt always the easiest.",1709420845,kt2j59d,t3_1b4mex2,t3_1b4mex2,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

browri,"Yeah it could certainly work. Part of how bupropion works is not only by blocking some of the NAchRs but also partially activating one or two. The modulating effect initially has a cognitive fogging effect that normalizes and actually becomes somewhat pro-cognitive after a desensitization period.

If you wanted to supplement acetylcholine levels, I'd say alpha-GPC. Citicoline (CDP-choline) can increase Phosphatidylcholine levels as well, but that's not the goal here, and alpha-GPC is gonna be cheaper.",1709600086,ktdst9e,t3_1b4mex2,t3_1b4mex2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Narrow_Fig_778,"Three weeks and you‚Äôve broken the habit physically. After that it‚Äôs just your mind playing tricks. Nicotine up regulates choline and dopamine transmission. Research safe cholinergics and verify with Reddit experience stories and pub med, CDP choline is the preferred route, add something that upregulates dopamine; for example a natural MAOI like rhodiola crenulata(stimulant properties needs to be cycled 8-12 weeks).",1709450292,kt4aqr9,t3_1b4mex2,t3_1b4mex2,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

zachary6227,"I mean, there are definitely reasons to quit nicotine.

It is an easy dopamine source that does not require work, health concerns over method of consumption like gum issue, nicotine raises blood pressure

I would say the patch is the best way to consume nicotine due to low speed of onset, and it will not detrimentally affect oral health",1709395964,kt0lxio,t3_1b4mex2,t1_kszs47u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

skytouching,"Yeah I do.
In my experience they relieved craving but didn‚Äôt really produce anything noticeable. I personally would think of them as a safe minor relief without really back pedaling. But if your symptoms are that bad I‚Äôd try and remedy them in some way even if it sounds counter intuitive.

Anti-Dissocialative,Long story short after the withdrawal wore off I realized I had been in a constant state of agitation with the nicotine. I feel much more peaceful these days and my mood is more stable. As for focus it‚Äôs a similar thing at first without the stimulation it was more difficult but now I find I am able to sit down and work much longer without being constantly distracted by my next nicotine hit in the back of my mind.

skytouching,"Yeah my bp is in healthy range and I ironically start to vape a little more more before a doctors appointment I get pretty anxious. But I honestly only feel nicotine bin the morning or if I forget my vape somewhere. And what I crave the most is the flavor obviously associated with minor dopamine release. That‚Äôs the thing about vaping is consistent low doses of nicotine all day opposed to say smoking a rapid high dose with hours in between.

It is pretty remarkable the method in which nicotine addicts people. My first experiences were second to dxm in terms of dysphoria, and any euphoria that I experience is really a feeling of relief more than any actual euphoria.
