Within first hour she got: 

- Brain fog 
- Fatigue 
- Instead of discipline / motivation She play games the whole day and don't have any willpower to get work done which wasn't a problem the day before 


What is going on? What can we do about it?

The recall that happened a few months ago was really depressing, however limited the exposure may have been. I am not making excuses for it. I just want to prove that I am dead-set on preventing anything of that nature from occurring ever again. And I want to continue offering quality peptides.

First of all, Sodium Benzoate won't be used anymore; going forward, I'll be adding Benzyl Alcohol to all peptide products. The UVC sterilization chamber I spoke about previously has been built. This will help with avoiding any potential microbiota spore contamination from bottle suppliers, which is likely what happened with the square bottles.

[\(The purple isn't from the UVC - I'd probably go blind if I turned that thing on out in the open\)](https://preview.redd.it/xv0x7r3xsslc1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be8aa07a1b0dbbc98b148770a9af2fc64c8a7214)

I thought it over, and made some adjustments. Now whenever we're dealing with an open peptide solution, everyone needs to wear a mask instead of just gloves. And instead of just cleaning solution, it's cleaning solution and then pure ethanol when using the bottle filling machine. And I make my employees use hand sanitizer before putting on gloves.

The work and storage rooms have long since been shut off from the outside, and from the office. But I also installed a dedicated AC system, dehumidifier and air purifier for that space. Florida is a swampland, so I'm aware that I have to be extra careful about this.

Peptide leaks kept happening last year, so I've tested the Pinealon bottles in a vacuum chamber before listing them. None leaked. Fingers crossed. If a leak happens again, I swear the bottle manufacturer will see me outside their house at 2 AM (for all intents and purposes, this is a Minecraft reference).

I've explored the tamper seal machines, and aluminum induction. I own the machines, but more needs to be done before I can use them during production. Which is easier said than done, but I'm getting closer to it.

Also wasn't happy with the quality of labels, so I've been putting a lot of effort into perfecting that process. They're more chemical resistant now, but I'm not quite there with them yet.

A lot of you have been incredibly patient and understanding with me during this all, and for that you have my utmost respect. If it weren't for the good people this community has to offer, I definitely would've quit some time last year - the r/Nootropics moderators, their affiliated businesses, and whoever else are playing extra dirty, constantly trying to sabotage my projects through mass reports.

Anyways, just wanted to talk about the progress/ changes we've made and give another big thanks to everyone who continues to show support, I'll prove that I deserve it in time.",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Everychem EXPOSED!
