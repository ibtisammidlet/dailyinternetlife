DiegPosts,"Its legit, I prefer Ipamorelin though. Are you trying to eat more? I'm trying to lose weight and it made me more fatigued, but sleep was good. 

Honestly just learn to inject and do ipam, or try both. Mk677 is dirty in the way it works",1709350334,ksyd6nc,t3_1b4dzs4,t3_1b4dzs4,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Flyboys_89,"Tried it. 3 of my friends tried it. Shits the most potent MK weve ever tried. Def works. Feels cleaner than other MK’s ive tried. Immediate appetite increase and deep sleep, better recovery, less water weight than other brands. Def Recommend",1709705470,ktknmo2,t3_1b4dzs4,t3_1b4dzs4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bionickiwi,I’ve been prescribe 10mg Mk677 by a clinic and that stuff was strong. I recently got Mk677 from Amino asylum dosing at 12.5 and the hunger is mild. Also I agree with it being dirty. I just wanted to see how different sources compare to each other because I think AA is underdosed and/or bunk,1709351739,ksyg7ju,t3_1b4dzs4,t1_ksyd6nc,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DiegPosts,"Hmmm yeah I think doing source comparisons would be really difficult, the people that the weightlifting community orders from is not going to be ordering from every chem I don't think there's just not enough overlap in the communities

It might be worth the risk if the value is decent from everychem",1709359283,ksyuan7,t3_1b4dzs4,t1_ksyg7ju,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
