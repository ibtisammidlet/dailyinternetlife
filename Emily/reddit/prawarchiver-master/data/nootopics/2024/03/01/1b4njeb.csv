Vlast_Tenshi,"Bromantane is an adaptogenic, you are not supposed to be dosing it only when you feel like doing it. Itâ€™s best to take it once every day in small doses (30-40mg) than in a single large dose (>100mg).",1709396112,kt0mc82,t3_1b4njeb,t3_1b4njeb,10,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"If she played games the whole day she might've actually had raised dopamine. **One of the effects of slight dopamine enhancement is also increased sedation as seen in people treated for adhd**

This last part is especially true if she is sleep deprived. Eg, didn't sleep well last night or slept too less in a way that build up. Stimulants can make people with adhd have a better focus, aka react more adequately. This can be felt as an enhanced sensitivity to your emotional/energy states, which thus seemingly paradoxially seems to sedate us. People with adhd often feel tired but not sleepy, maybe even agitated. On treatment tiredness can suddenly be felt as sleepyness/sedation

In other words, maybe she needed some rest",1709411435,kt1te17,t3_1b4njeb,t3_1b4njeb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

I kinda see where youâ€™re going with thatâ€¦I find nicotine way more relaxing than stimulating, although I havenâ€™t studied why

The intranasal is a little drippy so I typically applied it with my head tilted back, and then chilled in that position for couple mins. I also kept a Kleenex with me for a short while after to dab my upper lip if any dripped out.

100mg was a large dose for a first time user, and just in general as a single dose. Smaller dose a couple times a day is better.",1709429866,kt35lsd,t3_1b4njeb,t1_kt0hvz5,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
