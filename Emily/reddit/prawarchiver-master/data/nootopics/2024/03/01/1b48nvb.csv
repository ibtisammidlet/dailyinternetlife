yvelgon,"Keep up the transparency, it really sets y’all apart from any other company out there. All good if not, but is there a timetable for pre-order items like NSI?",1709462835,kt4sb2e,t3_1b48nvb,t3_1b48nvb,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
SunDevil329,"I don't think everychem is shutting down, folks. So Reddit banned sirsad. That sucks, but Reddit has never been our primary mode of communication.

If you're not on our Discord already, you should be. Invite link:

There is also an invite link under this subreddit's ""About"" information.

I know there was also talk of moving to Lemmy, Mastodon, or something similar. The trains are still running and on time, afaik.",1709828301,kts8uqx,t3_1b48nvb,t3_1b48nvb,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Birdy1979,"U/sirsadalot, I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, huge respect to you for your honesty and effortS to produce outstanding products , notably your Nasal spray Bromantane, that I’ve order 6 times already from the UK, as well as NSI 189 and Semax ( old bottles). 

I do ask Z** for customer loyalty discount, and hope you’ll introduce it soon.

Cheers from the UK",1709404257,kt19fhv,t3_1b48nvb,t3_1b48nvb,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
sustained1,Very interested in Pinealon. Can anyone share their experience of Pinealon subq vs sprays? My caveman assumption is that subq is better than sprays cos it's injected lol. but i don't know really.,1709863496,ktuubyh,t3_1b48nvb,t3_1b48nvb,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Abewoods88,"Hi.... I was on everychem last night looking over things I wanted to get and when I went on tonight it stated that I was banned or prohibited or something due to ""suspicious activity"".  Im unsure of what that might be but was hoping to order some bromantane spray... I could go other places but you had a good price.  Perhaps this can be fixed?

sirsadalot,"I honestly can't seem to accurately predict when things arrive for me. For nsi I would like to say a month but that could easily translate to 2 weeks or a half or a month and a half.

PabloAnnie,"With peptides sometimes intranasal can be really effective be because the olfactory nerves are able to take up peptides and transport them along the axons to the brain. I think this just differs wildly between every peptide. Insulin, Cere, Cortexin work great in my opinion and many people take it this way. Cere suddenly needs way less of a dosage intranasally, most people have enough with 0.2mL/day, some go much more wild, everyones body chemistry is different ofc so some might be less sensitive to Cere overall, or perhaps intranasal damage reduces uptake, though Cere would be great to repair any damage slowly and then might become more potent over time.

Pinealon no experience yet and haven't researched much, but I will always test IN first as it's just really practical and saves some time and effort.",1709866037,ktv0q81,t3_1b48nvb,t1_ktuubyh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
