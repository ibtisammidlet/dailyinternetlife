4000mg **L-Carnitine**:

\-> Anhedonia lift 

\-> Music sound MUCH better

\-> Cause fatigue

&#x200B;

4000mg  **L-carnitine L-tartrate**: 

\-> Anhedonia lift

\-> Music sound MUCH better

\-> Cause extreme fatigue 30 min after which gets worse overtime

\-> Depression

\-> I cried because I couldn't stand feelings of impending doom

&#x200B;

1000mg **ALCAR**

\-> Slight Anhedonia lift 

\-> Iritability

\-> indifferent feeling / I become introverted and I avoid other people

\-> Depression 

\-> Fatigue

\-> Brainfog

&#x200B;

What is going on? Could someone have an idea why I react like this to **L-carnitine L-tartrate?** 

With ALCAR I know it's the Acetylgroup, I react badly to all cholinergics -> Depression / Robotic feeling

I would never have anything to say, which would cause awkwardness and lead to anxiety. Hard to explain but it is some kind of mental block that prevents me, kind of like writer's block except verbally. Occasionally I will have a good day and can actually be funny and charming, but this is quite rare. It has improved aa bit as I grow older, but very slowly.

If I take enough caffeine to break though my tolerance, or get buzzed off of alcohol it is like a complete paradigm shift. Suddenly I can access all these memories to tell stories about, can come up with jokes on the fly and think of all these things to discuss. Obviously none of these are sustainable solutions.

A year ago I started taking NOW True Focus. It has l tyrosine, l phenylanine, DMAE as well as ginkgo and B vitamins. It was amazing. I could talk and talk and talk. I went from one word replies to typing whole paragraphs. I could have conversations with anyone without even consciously thinking about what I was going to sya next. It was easy to make friends and I even was able to go on a lot of dates and break a dry spell. I took it consistently for about a year without developing tolerance. But eventually it started causing severe acid reflux and I had to quit.

Now I am pretty lost without my little helper. Currently running bromantane but it's not really doing much. Thinking about noopept, racetams or even NSI-189.
