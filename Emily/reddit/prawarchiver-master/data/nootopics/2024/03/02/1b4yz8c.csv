psydstrr6669,"I‚Äôm the same as you and I‚Äôve noticed phenylalanine helps a lot, I first noticed it as a kid when I once drank a bunch of diet snapples that say ‚Äúwarning: phenylalanine‚Äù and I was suddenly really sociable and I‚Äôve since noticed other times that happened. I‚Äôve tried a form of phenylalanine that contains two kinds (DL I think?) that apparently (as I later read from a sirsadalot post) cancel each other out, and I consequently felt no different using it. And then I stopped nootropics as it was really just unhealthy for me to keep attributing things in my social life to chemical causes instead of consciously thinking about them. But maybe I‚Äôll see if I can get some l-phenylalanine or some of that True Focus. Also, kratom worked sometimes but it‚Äôs really hit-or-miss, also dextromethorphan cough medicine in not very high doses, but also hit-or-miss. Shrooms make me consciously address the things holding me back in my social interaction, they‚Äôre amazing but only like a once-a-year thing. Alcohol is fun but never constructive and it‚Äôs just unhealthy; it allows you to socialize by allowing you to ignore the things holding you back unlike shrooms which force you to address those things and get past them. Any connection you build with someone while drunk crumbles the minute you‚Äôre sober again.

Ultimately though, the fixation on the ability of substances to sometimes make your brain function better can distract you from focusing on actually materially making your life better. I was at the point where, whenever I was stressed out about something, I would just research what might fix my brain and allow me to fix my problems instead of just figuring out how to fix my problems. That said, I might go get some L-phenylalanine, lol.

Also I tried bromantane too and yeah it didn‚Äôt do much except make me physically kind of a beast, I had unlimited stamina and my resting heart rate was below 40bpm. But I didn‚Äôt really notice anything different mentally or socially.",1709433060,kt3d8o7,t3_1b4yz8c,t3_1b4yz8c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

herbalist65pete,"Since you appear healthy of mind, below are possible ideas.  Going back to the True Focus, possibly try another formulation.  Nearing 60, with past brain trauma, core supplements include high doses of specific B vitamins, DHA oil, phosphatidylserine & phosphatidylcholine, anti-oxidants, key amino acids, ormus minerals... Or do a little work on your microbiome and give your gut some added love, and address the acid reflux, which is very doable. And continue what worked with you in the past.

&#x200B;

It would be worth testing some GABAergic  pathways.  Rated from gentlest to stronger, via my experience and general feedback found in my use with others.  Rxes would be in the line of a valium, which is GABAergic, to understand the pathway  test I recommend.  Rxes in the benzo realm are the extreme.

&#x200B;

Below are suggestion guides. Some of these are inexpensive, relatively safe and have some degree of efficacy, though anyone's experience may range due to individual neurochemistry.

&#x200B;

1. L-Theanine (amino acid prominent in green tea) extremely safe.  Can start with 200mg-400mg. and feel its impact.  Gentle for most,  low dose caffeine and l-theanine is a college study night or exam day remedy.
2. Lithium Orotate (essential mineral-capsules) helps regulate GABA/glutamate balance
3. PharmaGABA (otc) capsules or pills (may be better for night time use, my experience)
4. Herbs/Polyphenols (tinctures, extracts, capsules, teas) lemon balm, magnolia bark, polygala, \*albizzia (one of my favorites)....there are more but these are relatively effective, in the realm of a calming/relaxing effect.
5. Selank (inhaled peptide) I consider it as a gentle nudge towards less inhibition and anxiety IF your anxiety is not excessive in public.
6. [Amanita Muscaria](http://actachemscand.org/pdf/acta_vol_35b_p0311-0324.pdf) (mushroom-capsule, gummy extract) One of my favorites. Day or night. 500mg to 1 gram
7. Phenibut (capsules with various doses) - Not meant for chronic use. I use for social situations where I want to energetically engage in dialogue.  That is it's effect upon me.  Slow acting and dose impacts effect.  I only do a handful of times in a month, if at all.

&#x200B;

There are others, ranging from GlyNAC, sarcosine, magnesium to kratom and CBD.  Racetams, they may help. Fasoracetam with AlphaGPC or Citicoline, would be my first choice, from experience. But I'd start with #1 above and see even if the impact is in the ballpark of what you need to engage more energetically in public. If not, then GABA pathway modulation is ruled out and you consider another path.",1709449421,kt49fqz,t3_1b4yz8c,t3_1b4yz8c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Odd_Watercress_6968,"Well your problem is apparently anxiety, and you have the association of reacting anxious in social situations. How you could break it, is taking propanalol it stops adrenaline and not adrenaline to bind in the brain. A lot of public speakers actually use it. Selank has strong anxiolytic effects. You could add a neurogenic compound like a low dose magic mushrooms, NSI,  noopept, dihexa. This solidifies the new habits of having fun in social situations and gives you the opportunity to have new positive associations with being social. 
I wouldn't do too many neurogenic compounds at once. Try one see how react than maybe add another one. That's enough dihexa + NSI is a good combi imo",1709474023,kt5b8fq,t3_1b4yz8c,t3_1b4yz8c,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Affectionate-Row1766,"That‚Äôs true everyone‚Äôs neurochemistry will translate into what said substance will do for them, glad it helped you, can‚Äôt speak for the majority of users when it comes to specific rc‚Äôs, Benzos, opiates, gabapentinoids but they typically make life worse in the long run. I was about to try some when I hit a tolerance wall with Kratom 50g+ a day and couldn‚Äôt get Jack shit out of it but I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt, I mean I guess your right cause I‚Äôm clean off benzos 3 months and in my program there‚Äôs someone who came off 5 years daily use no problems so it is possible",1709591517,ktd5ff3,t3_1b4yz8c,t1_ktct1xl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Agitated_Internet354,"You nailed it. When I first got some, I was under the impression it was ""baby molly,"" a term often applied to the substance and I think- inaccurate. I always describe it to people who are interested as similar to a psychedelic micro dose. The feeling it promotes can be euphoric but the 15 minute come up before evening out is, to my mind, fairly indistinguishable from a ""low wave"" acid trip. The part of a full acid trip where you are certainly feeling it but not at the intensity of a peak. The wellness and relaxation that comes afterwards is also of the introspective sort that I associate with psychedelics. It seems to me, as best I can tell, to be a generally mild 15 minute psychedelic that maintains all of the lasting benefits of doing psychedelics without the need to experience the full brunt of a 4-8 hour trip. It may have a downside, but the upside to that level of convenience will always be a factor in its favor for me.",1709524051,kt8zfiv,t3_1b4yz8c,t1_kt8w7ho,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
aldi-trash-panda,"I'm taking it with lions mane, siberian ginseng, psilocybin natalensis (more euphoric than cubensis), skullcap, and some other stuff sometimes.  like mucana and ginko",1709486547,kt67qn8,t3_1b4yz8c,t1_kt55uu4,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Issue is that fly agarics what can be occasionally seen from window coming up during autumn do contain numerous substances both pro-glutaminergic, and pro-gabaergic + bufotenin what is more psilocybin kinda thing, and more dirty stuff. And their related amounts may vary heavily, also whether it is end-of-summer or late-autumn mushrooms.  So it is casino. Drying should turn it more gabaergic, or passing thru your body what I heard may give strong effect when eating mushroom itself does not. 

But I just wonder if those capsules are purely muscimol extracted from Amanita what is GABA stuff, or extract as such containing everything from mushroom itself whatever happens to be there. 

Used to try lot of those when young, but failed to get much of effect.",1709480425,kt5qiq3,t3_1b4yz8c,t1_kt56nik,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
