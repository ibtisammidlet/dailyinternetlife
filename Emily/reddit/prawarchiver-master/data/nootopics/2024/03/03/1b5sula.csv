TropicNoot,"While I’ve used and benefitted from a variety of Lion’s Mane supplements, I’ve recently found Tiger Milk mushroom to be more effective without the libido decreasing effects Lion’s Mane seems to have. If you’re going to go with Lion’s Mane, I would go with Erinamax for the higher Erinacine A content.",1709502359,kt7gqfo,t3_1b5sula,t3_1b5sula,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Kaleidoscope_Effect,I’ve tried many Lion’s Mane supplements and didn’t notice a thing until I got a tincture from MyCoLove Farms. I do not work for them. No reason to promote them other than their stuff is grown here in Colorado and works well for me. Had many lost memories surface after a few weeks of use. Interesting to hear about the potential dangers though.,1709746251,ktmxflz,t3_1b5sula,t3_1b5sula,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Illustrious_Tie_6976,"Be very careful taking Lions Mane. Many find it very helpful, but it causes long-lasting effects even at low dosages for others. See anecdotal evidence at r/LionsManeRecovery

I'm actually recovering from Lions Mane usage right now. I believe it interacts with the SSRI that I'm tapering off of (or perhaps the fact that I'm tapering caused a negative reaction), but every time I have experimented with it, even at no more than 1/5th of a single Nootropics Depot brand capsule, has sent me spiraling for days with intense brain fog and suicidal depression for 2-5 days, then general anhedonia, depression and lack of motivation for another week or two.

Not saying not to take it, but suggest extreme caution and experimenting with very small, measured amounts, increasing in small increments based on how it affects you. You will tell how it affects you within 24 hours, especially after you sleep (often it gives intense dreams and closed-eye hallucinations the next morning).",1709518087,kt8l90e,t3_1b5sula,t3_1b5sula,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

RootbeerIsVeryNice,"LOL you must be somehow allergic to it or something.

When I have lions mane, which is in powdered form from the fruiting body at about half a teaspoon (thats a massive amount), in hot water...

It just makes me feel calmer. Less anxious. Better able to articulate myself. 

Have you ever done magic mushrooms?",1709691138,ktjs8pz,t3_1b5sula,t1_kt8l90e,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
saucysalmon_,"thanks for sharing, I just explored that sub. I recently started taking the host defense ""brain"" supplement (which includes lion's mane). I should note this isn't my first time taking mushroom supplements, I took solaray's mushroom complete for a few months this past summer.

there seem to be a lot of people on that sub saying lion's mane contributed to their anxiety or depression. I just combed the internet looking for actual scientific evidence about side effects and couldn't find anything. are there any studies or research that you know of that you can share?

there are people on this sub saying lion's mane destroyed their entire life and did permanent damage to their brains—can that be true?",1709739447,ktmd2gk,t3_1b5sula,t1_kt8l90e,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TropicNoot,It produces a slight cognitive boost for me. It also seems to have some positive effects on breathing ability.,1709644482,ktg2f3d,t3_1b5sula,t1_ktdwnyb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Illustrious_Tie_6976,"Yes I believe there is a lot of hyperbole and hypochondria on that subreddit, so it’s difficult to discern fact from subjective interpretation, and most things on the sub should be taken with a grain of salt. 

However, I believe there is a kernel of truth at the heart of the confusion, which is a series of fairly consistently reported negative side effects. Not everybody who takes lions mane experiences them, but those who experience side effects experience a fairly consistent series of cognitive symptoms. 

I do not have any studies at hand to provide. If you have positive experience with Lions Mane, then I’m happy for you, I would simply be aware and keep an eye out for certain symptoms which may be a sign to stop or ease up on the supplement.",1709746404,ktmxwlz,t3_1b5sula,t1_ktmd2gk,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
