ratneigre,Because a full agonist builds tolerance faster. If you want a full agonist at nicotinic receptors- just use nicotine. Oh you don’t want to because it’s addictive and builds tolerance fast? Well there’s the answer to your question.,1709652075,ktgl739,t3_1b6nvmz,t3_1b6nvmz,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14,I was wondering if u/sirsadalot could weight in. I value the insight he brings. However anyone with more info can chime in.,1709590645,ktd2vfg,t3_1b6nvmz,t3_1b6nvmz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"As it is claimed that phenylpiracetam does the same thing too, and is notorious of fast tolerance build up we can assume that same problem could potentially occur with this one too. 

Partial agonists only may have lousy effect, but apparently just because of that there is not so much tolerance build up either, so in long term it may be winner.",1709638499,ktfr98m,t3_1b6nvmz,t3_1b6nvmz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheIdealHominidae,noob question: why choose this over tropisetron?,1709762830,ktocayv,t3_1b6nvmz,t3_1b6nvmz,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14,"Nicotine is the best full agonist at this receptor site. I don't understand this well enough but stronger binding afffinity is what differentiates full and partial agonists, right? Although sofinicline is a full agonist it has weaker affinity than nicotine. Also Nicotine isn't as selective as this drug. Sofinicline only activates A4B2. Nicotine activates every nicotinic recptor along with A4B2.


Also if you look at the study i cite, the effects last at least a month.",1709659338,kth8zw0,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktgl739,-1,False,t5_4aoxhu
sirsadalot,Went with a partial agonist due to rapid tolerance and addiction associated with full agonists,1709662701,kthj8ae,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktd2vfg,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14,"Wouldn't cycling address the tolerance issue and in a brain that perhaps has adhd wouldn't upregulation of of A4B2 receptors lead to overall positive effect since you have more ach to activate the parts of the brain that are deficient.

Nicotine is an example of an A4B2 full agonist that does just this. If i remember correctly. It also has neuroprotective effects assuming you're not smoking it.",1709658948,kth7s2t,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktfr98m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,They work differently. Do different things,1709775523,ktpa6uq,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktocayv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14," nicotine is the only full agonist know to be associated with addiction and that is not because of oral ingestion its because of rapid entry to the blood stream via smoking, and the fact that nicotine is the most potent agonist at this site. For example, phenylpiracetam is not associated with addiction.

I don't necessarily want you to carry it, i just wanted someone to look deeper into it. Its a drug with just as much info and safety trials as ABT-089 and it seems like people haven't even heard of it.  It would be awesome if people investigate its use personally and we can get more confident info.

Thanks for responding, I appreciate your work and this sub.",1709668048,kthzdqc,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_kthj8ae,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Upset_Scientist3994,"Mayby, since that is how phenylpiracetam users have dealed with issue. There is not any talk of ABT-894 at all, so it is not known  but intuitively that should work.",1709665327,kthr6tt,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_kth7s2t,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheIdealHominidae,how do they do different things when they both agonize nicotinic receptors?,1709775582,ktpacev,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktpa6uq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14,It sucks because out of any agonist at this receptor it seems like the one with the most evidence for efficacy in ADHD is just never mentioned and people don't try it. My goal is for people to at least try it out and talk about their experience.,1709668236,kthzybb,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_kthr6tt,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
fruiop,Tropisetron targets a7 nicotinic receptor. ABT targets a4b2.,1709775701,ktpanlh,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktpacev,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TheIdealHominidae,That's right but then why ABT over gallantamine?,1709775803,ktpax77,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktpanlh,0,False,t5_4aoxhu
arvada14,"Selectivity, there are different types of nicotinic receptors. I want a full agonist that only targets a4b2 receptors because its been shown to improve memory in adhd. I don't necessarily want any other receptors agonized because there could be peripheral side effects.",1709853862,ktu7sm9,t3_1b6nvmz,t1_ktpax77,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
