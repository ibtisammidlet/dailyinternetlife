But how about ABT-894 (sofinicline). Instead of being a partial agonist it is a full agonist at that receptor. Two rather large studies have tested doses ranging from 2 mg to 6mg BID ( and possibly 8 mg) with beneficial effects being found for ADHD with a good effect size at 4 mg BID ( 0.45) in one study. This compound went all the way up to phase 2 and was just dropped. The kicker is that they matched this  head to head with a known ADHD treatment  (atomoxetine) and it showed comparable effect. This compound seems way more promising than ABT-089. What am I missing in my research, why favor one over the other?
