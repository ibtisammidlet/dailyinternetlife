DiegPosts,"Controversial posts that put a lot of eyes here in the past 2 weeks and recent drama today about an alleged attack by another sub probably did it. 

We've gained like 1,000 members in the past week and a half and we're getting more popular posts that are likely being recommended to users.

Also I just realized the recent most popular post the ashwagandha post, is going crazy lol

edit: also sirsad hypothesize that an algorithm tweak on Reddit is favoring nootropics. Or maybe our subreddit filled some set conditions in the past few weeks to start being recommended. We used to be #21 in science news and discussion and we're like 17 now, well now back to 20",1709840287,ktt53me,t3_1b92ycr,t3_1b92ycr,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
