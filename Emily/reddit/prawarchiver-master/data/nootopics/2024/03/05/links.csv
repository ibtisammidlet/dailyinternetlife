The mix has been passed down to him from generation and he swears by it. 

I only know one of the incidents of it which I ashwagandha and not the other. He is currently 85 and the healthiest person in his age group i have met. Even sometimes I or my dad might forget something important but he won't all out important documents are with him as he will remember where he kept them  with exact presention.

Even when he goes to doctor for checkup they always comment at how his vitals are great and better then people half his age.

He gets the herbs from a local herbal/ayurvedic store owner who grows his own herbs in his farm in the Himalayas and then makes it powder to sell it.

If anyone wants I will post the full 7 list of incidents when I visit him in a few days.

He also follows the rule of no outside food or drink and 45min walk after dinner.

He is also vegetarian from birth and has never eaten any kind of meat or even eggs and  drinks 2 cups of masala chai daily with many spices(ginger, cardamom, cinnamon,cloves,holy basil ). The masala tea is tasty though

Also heavy breakfast and lunch and a light dinner 


Edit:- so I asked him and here the mix

1-Stem of plant Tinospora

2-bindii

3-indian gooseberry

4-ashwagandha

5-Liquorice(not take if u have diabetes)

6-Asparagus racemosus

7-Long Pepper
