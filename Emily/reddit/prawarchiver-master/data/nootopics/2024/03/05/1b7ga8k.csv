You work with anger by working with what's under it.

Pure_Abbreviations59,"No, I must be right every time! Don’t you know the rules! Go back to class player  because you got schooled ya fool! Just kidding I totally agree haha and I’m not an expert on anything honestly haha just catch a thing here and there very much bro scienced out at my core of knowledge.. 

To me the real conundrum is if humans would actually want and enjoy being immortal at our human core. Any thoughts? Because personally there’s no way I’d want to live past say 100 because idk at 34 I have not found anything in the grind of life that makes me want to be immortal anytime soon here lmao. How weird life would be knowing there’s no end in site to help pressure finish goals and achievements.",1709789848,ktq7p4n,t3_1b7ga8k,t1_ktq5ut8,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
emmiegeena,"That makes total sense. I've come to think about things like suffering or anxiety in a similar way. Necessary in that they play a role in motivation, but at some point, too much intensity for too long will pass the threshold where it stops being a useful indicator of anything and just starts accumulating as junk anxiety or junk suffering. So I'm inclined to think of anger as the useful indicator and aggression as the state where the signal gets lost in the noise so to speak",1709769682,ktov101,t3_1b7ga8k,t1_ktntnf3,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
derokieausmuskogee,It's really a shame that coca leaves are illegal just because some people choose to abuse them. I would imagine there are benefits to therapeutic use of the raw leaves. They could probably replace a lot of OTCs.,1709749336,ktn6zjt,t3_1b7ga8k,t1_ktku699,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
FearlessRestaurant98,"When everyone around u speaks multiple languages growing up its easy to  learn it as it's a necessity. Friends spoke different language, school taught different language and spoke another one at home .


Although writing and reading is still an issue due to my dyslexia which makes learning new language hard so I have mostly learnt it by speaking and listening.",1709750888,ktnbsiz,t3_1b7ga8k,t1_ktnaa4z,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
