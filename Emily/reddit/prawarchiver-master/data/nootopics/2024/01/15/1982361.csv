Odd_Watercress_6968,"I would stark with relatively low dosages of each. Here's my complete protocol:

-Modafinil 25 mgs every other day for two weeks, then every two weeks increase the dosage 25mgs. Don't go over 400mgs though.

-L-DOPA I take as mucuna puriens 400mgs (don't take it more than 3 times a week).

-Gingko biloba I take one capsule a day, I think it's 6000mgs.
Huberzine a 240 mcg.

-alpha GPC 300mcg take it only on days I need to be very focused and with good memory.

-phenylpiracetam 100mg.

- Caffeine I don't like because it's addictive and messes my sleep up",1705673762,kil8zf9,t3_1982361,t1_kil3xti,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
