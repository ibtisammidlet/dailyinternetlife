1. **Parkinson's Disease**: TAK-071 reduced falls in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, particularly in situations that required the interplay between cognitive and motor functions ([Kucinski & Sarter, 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-021-05822-x)).

2. **Schizophrenia**: TAK-071 showed promise in improving sociability deficits and working memory in animal models of schizophrenia, suggesting it could be a new therapy for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms associated with the disorder ([Kurimoto et al., 2021](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2021.136240)).

3. **Attentional Performance**: It improved attentional performance in rats with cholinergic losses, indicating potential benefits for patients with partial cholinergic losses ([Kucinski et al., 2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-019-05354-5)).

4. **Scopolamine-Induced Changes**: A study explored TAK-071's effects on scopolamine-induced changes in quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) power bands in cynomolgus monkeys. It was found to suppress scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands ([Kurimoto et al., 2018](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/468686)).

5. **Comparative Studies with Xanomeline**: In vivo pharmacological profiles of TAK-071 and xanomeline were compared in rodents. TAK-071 suppressed MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion and improved scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits with minimal cholinergic side effects, while xanomeline improved cognitive impairments but had cholinergic side effects in rats ([Mandai et al., 2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.07.003)).

6. **Low Cooperativity and Induction of ADP**: TAK-071, as a novel M1R selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) with low cooperativity, induced afterdepolarization (ADP) in layer 5 pyramidal neurons without causing mouse ileum contraction in vitro ([Kimura et al., 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.700)).",1705325738,khyp7f5,t3_196yqvr,t3_196yqvr,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
