Collationem,Bromantane is highly soluble in oil. I could easily dissolve it to 100mg/mL in MCT oil. Personally I just blend it with my TRT and do daily IM injections (which I had been doing anyway for the TRT).,1706004835,kj6cq7u,t3_19dd3pp,t3_19dd3pp,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
weltweite,"Yes some people may have deviated septums (not uncommon), blockage due to allergies, mucus, etc. I can see how it could be highly variable and inconsistent. I try to clear my nose out with a saline aerosol spray and do some sinus humming to boost nitric oxide significantly before spraying (improved clearance and vasodilation). This is also great for sinus infections but that is a different topic.",1705992783,kj5wb41,t3_19dd3pp,t3_19dd3pp,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Crafty-Emu-769,"have you tried slightly inhaling (the exact method needs a bit of optimization for me, localized sniffing with only nose rather than whatever way of breathing in) in addition to spraying?",1706243922,kjm4fzu,t3_19dd3pp,t3_19dd3pp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Wellyeahso,"MCT or C8? I ask because I have read multiple places that C8 is necessary, and C8 is only part of what is in MCT.

I have tried multiple times with C8, to emulate a vendor's nasal spray product, and I cannot get even 15mg/ml to dissolve in C8 Caprylic Acid, not even with heating or 24h of magnetic stirring.",1706033670,kj87m03,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kj6cq7u,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TrenAppreciator420,"You mean you mix with the MCT then blend into your TRT? I might try this with olive oil lmao, what dosage do you use IM? Might blend with my tren idk teehee",1706101429,kjce9dz,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kj6cq7u,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Nonpolarsolvent,I think humming and the associated NO release is probably the most underrated self-care imaginable - it works!! And as well as clearing the sinuses it also lowers blood-pressure fast,1706099286,kjca0sr,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kj5wb41,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,MCT. Are you sure you have legit Bromantane? Never tried to dissolve it in other oils but I would suspect it to be soluble in many based on its lipophilicity.,1706131577,kjen320,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kj87m03,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Technically I just homebrew the whole thing myself. 30mg Test E, 10mg Primo E, 10mg Bromantane in 0.2mL MCT oil. The Bromantane feels at least as potent as 200mg oral.",1706129860,kjeht5l,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjce9dz,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Wellyeahso,"NootropicSource was the source. I haven't had the Bromantane tested,but the vendor is frequently used by others. 

I haven't tried alternate oils myself, only tried pure C8 because that is what EveryChem allegedly uses to make a 90mg/ml nasal spray [that I was attempting to replicate].

I suppose I'll have to try another oil base, but it likely won't work well as a nasal spray.",1706132304,kjepbof,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjen320,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
TrenAppreciator420,"God damn, how long does the effect last in comparison? I'm trying to work out how to get some in my steroid blend without needing to buy a sterile carrier oil. Where'd you get the MCT from, I assume it's in vials?",1706132298,kjepb10,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjeht5l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
TrenAppreciator420,"Just did my first shot, sterilised a little cap thing and put my daily RIP blent (test/tren/mast) and let it dissolve, pinned 10mg with 0.7ml of my oil, is there a better way of doing it?",1706167541,kjh27g4,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjeht5l,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"I use PGLchem for everything that EC and my usual Chinese vendors don't/can't supply. Got my Bromantane crystals there. I have no idea why your Bromantane doesn't dissolve in C8 while according to EC it should dissolve. It can either be the purity of your C8, the purity of your Bromantane or inaccurate information on the solubility on EC (quite unlikely I suppose).",1706169910,kjh5o6u,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjepbof,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Effect lasts all day, the half-life of 11 hours in humans seems pretty accurate. I buy MCT oil at a lab supplier in my country, I always boil the resulting solution and sterilize through .20 micron filters. I always add 1% BA to solutions I am going to inject, mainly to keep it bacteriostatic in storage. Theoretically just sterilizing the solution through a filter would already be sufficient but I boil it beforehand just in case. Never had any issues doing it this way.",1706170713,kjh6ss5,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjepb10,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,Well I suppose that's fine already. Quite the amount of oil imo but I guess that's needed to pin your blend. If purely Bromantane you should be able to achieve 100mg/mL in MCT oil easily.,1706169498,kjh5364,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjh27g4,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

TrenAppreciator420,"Just seen my steroid guy does vials of MCT oil, I guess I'll just get some syringe filters. Do you just sterilise a glass beaker and make the solution in there and then transfer back into the steroid vial?",1706181950,kjhm8z1,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjh5364,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"Nah, that seems a bit overkill. Just boiling the beaker for 30min + sterilizing the contents through a filter afterwards will be sufficient.",1706195968,kjigx98,t3_19dd3pp,t1_kjhm8z1,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
