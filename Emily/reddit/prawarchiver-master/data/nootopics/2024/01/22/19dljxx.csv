Legitimate_Banana512,"DHEA/pregnenolone + Progesterone repair nmda receptors

a mao-b inhibitor seems to help ive read, for cheonic cerebral hypofusion. Also ibogaine or tabernanthalog, as they are known to raise growth factors

Nad+ seems also very important with related issues, but you gotta take it in a certain form. Nmr it was called or something?",1706061284,kjaemvt,t3_19dljxx,t3_19dljxx,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

bruhman123534t6,"Sounds good dude. Ive never actually heard of anybody doing IV with neurogenics but it would probably do you right. IV is WAY more bioavailable.
