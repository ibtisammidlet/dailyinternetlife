I've been taking a high doses of a handful of supplements that help, without them I can't function due to extreme dizziness, anxiety and other weird sensational symptoms.

The main supplement I've been taking is nac but have been getting side effects that also majorly effect my ability to function, most notably if I take too much there's an intense pressure in the middle of my forehead, my short term memory gets worse and long term my histamine is going crazy. I fear I might be prone to mast cell activation.

I now take 500mg nac every 2-3 days to keep things in check.

The complete list of supplements I take is:
NAC
Agmatine
Theanine
Taurine
Black seed oil
Ginger
Magnesium
Melatonin because even with all that I still have sleep issues
And added p5p yesterday because I read it can help with histamine

I can tell their having an overall positive effect because if I was only taking 500mg of nac 3 months ago I wouldn't be able to work or drive or interact with the real world in any meaningful way

So, finally, is J147 safe and could it replace all these supplements and maybe even accelerate my recovery? 

If anybody has any other input on things I could try, I'm all ears

Is so frustrating dealing with sprays, particularly the bromantine spray, I just don't get it. 

Today I sprayed it in 10 different ways and the only way that work that I discovered was laying my head on its side on a pillow and spraying on the top nostril. Boom, works.

I wish there was a way to inject bromantane but I don't think it's soluble in anything injectable so boo. And I know for a fact a lot of people in the community also suck at doing this. 

The head on side method is something I'll be using for now on, all the other advice and methods I've read suck.",False,t5_4aoxhu,I hate nasal sprays,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/19dd3pp/i_hate_nasal_sprays/
