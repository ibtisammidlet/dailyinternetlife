CryptoEscape,"I believe the tyrosine may just boost its acute effects…essentially make it “feel dopaminergic.”

Tyrosine is not necessary to get the benefits of taking Bromantane for a longer period (e.g. a 4-8 week cycle,) which I believe is where Bromantane really shows its benefits.",1704156513,kfws9y8,t3_18w2jwp,t3_18w2jwp,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Friedrich_Ux,"ime taking a dopamine precursor like DLPA, Tyrosine or NALT does improve its dopaminergic effects yes.",1704220102,kg0cf9n,t3_18w2jwp,t3_18w2jwp,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
Curious_Estate_5550,"No, I don't even think that tyrosine adds anything that you can reality notice to bromantane effects",1704209142,kfzi55n,t3_18w2jwp,t3_18w2jwp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Crafty-Emu-769,"even if we are thinking only about tyrosine hydroxylase upregulation no, the % increase in dopamine synthesis can be expected to be almost the same. 

At baseline tyrosine hydroxylase is about 80% saturated but if it's upregulated by 2x that will remain the same",1704282012,kg44en0,t3_18w2jwp,t3_18w2jwp,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"Thanks for this info, it's very helpful.

Also, I hope you would give a suggestion as to what would be a good amount of sublingual Bromantane to take on the 4-8 week cycle? And what time of day would it be best to take Bromantane during the cycle too?

Much thanks in advance for any answers and tips and all the best for 2024 too!",1704206156,kfzb0hc,t3_18w2jwp,t1_kfws9y8,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Chisto23,"I honestly think nasal is levels ahead of any other form of use, but anyway, the dose is very individual varied, I don't know how the sublingual doses work for Bromantane, but what I can say is best time to take it is before a main task of the day, such as before you're heading to work, or before you start doing a project, once all in one dose at that time, and it's also ok to redose a small amount later at a time you feel fits.",1704340180,kg8cagl,t3_18w2jwp,t1_kfzb0hc,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,"Thanks for the quick clear reply and more helpful info! 

Darn, I wish I had ordered the nasal version. Maybe I can make a nasal solution from the powder?",1704378629,kga5joi,t3_18w2jwp,t1_kg8cagl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Chisto23,"I've actually seen threads related to this come up in the past and maybe there's a way idk, it's maybe worth a shot looking into hah. All I can say is based off so many things I've looked into about bromantane and my own experience nasal is definitely effective, hope you can figure something out!",1704380613,kgaag83,t3_18w2jwp,t1_kga5joi,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
DrBobMaui,More thanks Chisto23! I am researching it as we speak. So far nothing definitive but I will keep at it since I have a bunch of powder.,1704399336,kgbsjny,t3_18w2jwp,t1_kgaag83,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
