PabloAnnie,"You should always DYODD! Don't let other people tell you what to do instead of doing some simple search term synthesis and then reading multiple sources that aren't all marketing sites. Once you've arrived at a good view of the risks and benefits and how they shift with different approaches to administration. Some of such ways need to be done correctly and while knowing 100% sure you've done everything you should. 

Only after your own learning and research could you discuss your viewpoint and expect some feedback to maybe arrive at an even better understanding.

 I'm sure you meant well, but it seems now like you were too lazy to even attempt to understand what exactly you need help with understanding and making other people do the work for you. 

Most importantly though, this is not magical seasalt, and if you don't have any medical or pharmacological knowledge yet it's best to just start with the figurative (or literal) ""Ashwagandas and Theanines that are the current ""life-changing stacks"" (""for sure as I've felt so good since my package arrived yesterday evening"") ‚ÄúHow's your 30 day log looking now a month later?‚Äù Ehh I started taking mushrooms after 3 days because I think the other stuff suddenly made me more sad than since my package arrived! Those were the bomb when taking all 7 together but I forgot to take them all the time as I didn't have enough water next to me to take all those capsules üßê Please laugh at the idiocy if you see such claims in topics and comments üëª

Collationem,Usual ROA is subQ injection for peptides. If you're using Ipamorelin for hypertrophy you'll be disappointed though.,1706174949,kjhcg34,t3_19crr0j,t3_19crr0j,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
danielil_,"Thanks you‚Äôre right.
What I mostly unsure of is the ROA for this specific product.",1706168650,kjh3udz,t3_19crr0j,t1_kj46l4m,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"Any experience in how it differs from MK-677? I bought it basically because the MK was out of stock and I responded really positive on the MK. Better eating habits, improved anxiety slightly, sleep felt deeper, some muscle growth seemed to happen without much effort, muscle-memory surely enabled that to happen though. Is ipa purely for appetite then in your opinion / experience?",1707009061,kote8op,t3_19crr0j,t1_kjhcg34,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
PabloAnnie,"Yeah there's multiple options. It's said to be active orally as well, just like BPC-157,¬† although it's probably much less bioavailable. I've seen very positive anecdotes as well as negative for this route. Then ofc subQ is usually most effective. It's been a while ago so I kind of forgot, but I think I've seen intranasal delivery as an option which interested me a lot. I still've got my bottle in the refrigerator as I did other things in the meantime. Let me know what you've found / are considering and who knows we can trail it together and take some notes if it happens to be so.¬†",1707008711,kotdeka,t3_19crr0j,t1_kjh3udz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"MK-677 is way stronger. Anecdotally MK was the only compound from all the peptides that can compare with 2-4IU of real HGH. The issue with MK is that it is riddled with side effects for most. I still haven't found a good protocol to use it long term. Keeping the dose to 10mg max helps. Furthermore, most people likely need:

- blood glucose control agent
- cortisol control agent (questionable)
- prolactin control agent
- water retention control agent (diuretic)

I would consider yourself very lucky if you can tolerate MK without experiencing any side effects. I would definitely keep an eye on fasted BG levels. With MK you can absolutely have hypertrophy benefits comparable to 2-4IU of HGH (by proxy IGF-1 elevation). However HGH is just not very strong at hypertrophy when compared to actual AAS. HGH = predominantly anti-aging + fat loss.

As said, Ipamorelin doesn't compare to MK (or HGH) at all, and even in the usual stack with Mod-GRF 1-29 injected SQ 3x daily the effects are modest at best. The main merit of that stack is that it comes without side effects.",1707229497,kp6i5sk,t3_19crr0j,t1_kote8op,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
