I’m interested in using EveryChem’s Ipamorelin – Solution (0.5mg/mL) for hypertrophy.

What would be the suggested usage insturctions?

I've researched allopregnanolone for a while now, and it seems to be the perfect neurosteroid for sleep and anxiety. Practically an natural benzodiazepine. However, pregnelolone doesn't seem to do that for me. I have taken dosages from 100-1000mgs, and they never made me tired or sleep better. 

I'm wondering whether this is due to the CB1 allosteric antagonistic effect of pregnelolone, since preg is preferentially metabolized into allopregnanolone. Progesterone is the same, since it is a step in the pregnelolone metabolic pathway. 

The other hypothesis which I had was due to the biphasic response of both allopregnanolone and benzodiazepines, 1.5-2 nmol/L serum concentration would cause these symptoms. However, I have since then taken 1000mg of preg, assuming no rate limiting from liver enzymes, that should have reached serum concentrations of 4 nmol/L.

Has anyone taken both? Is the neurosteroid effect of allopregnanolone more noticeable with progesterone than pregnelolone?",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Pregnelolone causes lighter sleep, would progesterone do the same?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/19cd62k/pregnelolone_causes_lighter_sleep_would/
