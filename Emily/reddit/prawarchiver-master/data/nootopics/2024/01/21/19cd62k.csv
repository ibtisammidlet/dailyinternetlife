Inner-Education2467,"No matter how much pregnenolone I take it makes me robotic as hell (CB-1 antagonism)

I really dont know how could anyone respond good to it....

Right now I have progesterone tablets which I got from my GF, would love to try them for sleep",1705871220,kixxvp0,t3_19cd62k,t3_19cd62k,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
