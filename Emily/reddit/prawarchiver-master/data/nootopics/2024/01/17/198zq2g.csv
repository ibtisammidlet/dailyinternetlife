splugemonster,Long hauler here since May 2021. My sleep got terrible during a stressful event last year. The only thing that helps to this day is 50mg trazadone,1705512730,kib2ixc,t3_198zq2g,t3_198zq2g,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Decent-Boysenberry72,"Good, anti depressants are poison. Grab a cheap ass box of Mexidol off Amazon and take one midday.  Also 20 minutes before bed have a tasty spoonful of glycine with two 600mg NAC capsules (GlyNAC).  You could be an extremely low glycine producer.  NAC is about the only substance that can reverse oxidative stress from covid.  GlyNAC restores the immune system, reverses alzheimers, Parkinsons, and basically forces your body back to health.   And a spoonful of glycine makes the nac go down, in the most delightful way.",1705517814,kibi75m,t3_198zq2g,t1_kib3veb,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Decent-Boysenberry72,"If your eyes get red the first dose.... congrats, you just chelated all your heavy metals out of your brain.   It won't happen twice unless you have a taste for paint chips and salsa.",1705518047,kibiwsr,t3_198zq2g,t1_kibi75m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Palipicard,"Is Mexidol really effective ?
I cannot also take NAC and Glycine because it is high in sulfur. I am 100% intolerant to high sulfur foods",1705518419,kibk17i,t3_198zq2g,t1_kibi75m,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
