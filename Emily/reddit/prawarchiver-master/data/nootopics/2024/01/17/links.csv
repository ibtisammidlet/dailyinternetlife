I had a motorcycle accident one month ago and I had a surgery with general anesthesia to put a surgical nail and screw on my shoulder.

Since the accident, my sleep has been completely disrupted.  At first I slept very badly with the pain but now my sleep is just very, very poor quality and light. I am more tired than before I can sleep at 9pm, sleep 11 hours and wake up exhausted. Spend my whole day in bed and I am starting to get headaches now.
I feel like I'm sleeping very lightly, so light that I want to wake up, but I can't. Sometimes I wake up early tired. I notice that if I wake up at 6 am naturally and go eating a bit, go to toilet and if I try to sleep one hour later, I feel less tired.

Maybe something trigger my MCAS, because when I have MCAS flare up, my sleep is bad. Unfortunately, I have the same life as before accident. This reminds me of a crisis I had a year ago because of a medication and which lasted six months

Do you have an idea of something I can take to help me to have a deep sleep ?
 I cannot take benadryl or this kind if antihistamine because I wake up more exhausted. 
I will microdose shrooms again but it helps in the past with my long covid",False,t5_4aoxhu,Poor light sleep after surgery,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/198zq2g/poor_light_sleep_after_surgery/
