splugemonster,"nice thing about vyvanse is that it dosnt interact with much, aside from the few standard ones everyone should be aware of.

&#x200B;

My thought is that theyre both dopaminergic and therefore will overexcite neurons, which can increase glutamate expression and lead to neuronal damage and even senescence.  Typically, i advise against the combination.",1705705067,kins22x,t3_19ar5kc,t3_19ar5kc,9,False,t5_4aoxhu
Vye7,Bromantane and modafinil are a good combo. I stay away from amphetamines now as they make you feel productive but actually hinder you on so many aspects,1705702242,kink903,t3_19ar5kc,t3_19ar5kc,7,False,t5_4aoxhu

FrogFister,"If you take Bromantane 1 day then you have break several days and take it again, understand it won't do much and it won't work, this is not that type of mechanism. For Bromantane to work, it needs to be taken daily because it builds up its effects (it also works great if you drink coffee too) and expect to feel and form an opinion on Bromantane in a week of daily intake (i do 50-70mg sublingually morning 7 AM and has a 4 hour come up i think until it starts but also faster in time) and in about a week of daily use give or take, you can definitely notice it. I also read about this in numerous bromantane threads and experience it myself. Bit of piracetam and gingko biloba (gingko long term go) are nice, also alcar for who can tolerate it. but since you tak vyvanse which I am not familiar with, stick to what you know is best for you.",1705728896,kipbi4p,t3_19ar5kc,t3_19ar5kc,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

EstablishmentBig4046,Clinical amphetamines are typically fine if dosed appropriately especially in the case of elvanse. If you're using amphetamines as a nootropic as someone without ADHD then this advice is fair but if you have ADHD i'd never suggest to anyone that they should stop using the drug.

curiosmind1389," But that’s just an analogue of vyvanse, so why would it interact differently? They’re both dopmanergic, vyvanse just hits 3 receptor locations while concerta(methylphenidate) is only antagonizing 1….

FrogFister,"You should try to google this: *Bromantane reddit* and go read at least 10 different threads with all its comments.

I take it for upregulation on something specific about dopamine. Also motivating enough to start making new habits.

In about 2 weeks because it works good, I actually some days take less of it, 10-20mg like a spec. Is it placebo for a spec, maybe, maybe not. Either way the reason I use it is to simply get on new vibe (brain chemistry) so I won't need bromantane after some changes in life. Please understand that you should still do your part, the supplement can be a temporary companion sometimes, don't let the companion be the main player in your game. Is not addictive or tolerance too soon, but I highly recommend you google and read many threads about it. *Bromantane reddit*",1705747924,kiq2m2q,t3_19ar5kc,t1_kipzgrt,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"I’d agree.

DexMethylphenidate feels slightly cleaner than Methylphenidate, but usually they make you try methylphenidate first.

It definitely still caused a significant tolerance though, as well as bad crashes.

It hits a bit harder than Amphetamine IME and has a much sharper drop off….sometimes it feels instant.

Very short lived too…,I work second shift, dose very late and often fall asleep four or five hours later
