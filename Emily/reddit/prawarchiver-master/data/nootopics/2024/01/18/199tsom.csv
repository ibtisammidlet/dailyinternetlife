sirsadalot,"Hard to say, especially considering I had trashed hundreds of bottles as soon as I noticed something translucent in them - may sound crazy, but even if they weren't contaminated they'd be impossible to mix again evenly.

But given the conditions, whatever it is must be pretty resilient and capable of growing on virtually no nutrition, no sunlight exposure, colder temperature and have a variable color range. I'd start there.",1705931479,kj1fh71,t3_199tsom,t1_kihsc72,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

behehevdkndbejdbd,"Do you not hold any for micro testing ? This is pretty standard requirement along with using batch numbers. 

If you have some left over , you can send to labs to test for what it is. 

Considering this is an issue I’m not sure why you wouldn’t do this",1706072737,kjb5lbe,t3_199tsom,t1_kj1fh71,5,False,t5_4aoxhu
