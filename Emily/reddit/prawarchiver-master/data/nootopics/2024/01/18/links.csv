I just received bromantane spray from everychem. I'm prescribed 50mg Vyvanse, which I usually take 3-5 times a week, and I often take modafinil 1-2 times a week on my off days if I have a lot I need to do. Is taking bromantane with either of these fine, or should I only use it on my days off? Ideally, if bromantane works well for me, I'd like to get to the point where I'd only take harsher stimulants as a kind of nuclear option for  when life gets hectic and I'm feeling overwhelmed instead of using them to get through day-to-day life.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Bromantane + Vyvanse or Modafinil?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/19ar5kc/bromantane_vyvanse_or_modafinil/

So how is it much better or more novel than racetams? I know most racetams I’ve tried don’t do a whole lot except a little more arrousal and irritability,False,t5_4aoxhu,Whats with the tak653 hype lately?

sirsadalot,1705594627,self.NooTopics,199tsom,True,16,False,/r/NooTopics/comments/199tsom/contamination_in_square_semax_and_selank_bottles/,1709901214,71,"It's genuinely possible that the Semax, Selank, NA-Semax and NA-selank shipped in the clear white glass rectangular bottles were ruined by some type of fungus, although I'm still baffled. This has never happened to me before ever, so I believe this is due to the new bottles we were experimenting with, which must've arrived contaminated(?). At first I thought it was undissolved tween 80 because of my new mixing equipment and I immediately threw them out about a week later but some had already shipped before then. Please do not use them, throw them away ASAP and get a refund.

This was limited to the most recent batch in clear, rectangular bottles, and only the peptides listed. We thoroughly investigated all the other products and found nothing was wrong/ susceptible. So sorry we didn't catch it in time, but I can assure you that nothing like this will be happening again. Please keep reading if you don't believe me.

New sterilization procedures will be used, abandoning sodium benzoate because it is completely ineffective and considering other sterilizing additives for future peptides. No new peptides will be listed until then. In addition I will subject all future empty peptide bottles to UVC light just in case, and instead of cleaning solution I'll use 95% pure ethanol in the tubes.

I don't think very many people received the rectangular bottles, but I'd you did, again please reach customer service for your refund. I am really, really, REALLY sorry. The work space has already been scrubbed with bleach, and will not be using that brand of bottle ever again for manufacturing.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Contamination in square Semax and Selank bottles - IMPORTANT!,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/199tsom/contamination_in_square_semax_and_selank_bottles/
