Alksfrench,I've heard that some rats used moda analogs with good results (but they are RCs). Alkonchem sells some. My rat uses 4-clmodafinil which is cheap and the effect doesn't last too long (like 8h then a subtle crash).,1705694177,kimwkw9,t3_19alyxj,t3_19alyxj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Odd_Watercress_6968,"Mucuna puriens (L-Dopa) can replace the dopamine that you usually get from bromantane and Modafinil. And Huberzine A and Gingko biloba will increase the acetylcholine which will help with concentration and memory. Those supplements might help, but it's very unlikely that they will give you the same feeling",1705778140,kis10i8,t3_19alyxj,t3_19alyxj,0,False,t5_4aoxhu

Nuarmo,"For one, it's well established and studied far more thoroughly than flmodafinil. 

Not once has it raised any red flags for me with customs as opposed to amphetamines.",1705702839,kinlxlq,t3_19alyxj,t1_kin13mn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
OrneryLandscape5402,"i very much agree with the first thing and the second makes sense. ive been taking armod for a while now and definitely recommend it in general.

that being said I still think armod is more likely to get flagged at customs than flmod or bromantane. At least in the US it's scheduled outright while bromantane/ flmod arent. (although flmod is definitely an analogue lol)

still never had any problems with armod at customs prior to getting a prescription though.",1705716773,kiolor3,t3_19alyxj,t1_kinlxlq,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
