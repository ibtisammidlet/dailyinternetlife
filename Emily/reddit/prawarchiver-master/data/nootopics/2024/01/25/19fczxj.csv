disco_disaster,"I used it for benzo withdrawal, and it helped. 

Made it easier to tolerate the withdrawal. I had tried quitting dozens of times, and had made it through withdrawal many times only to relapse. 

Ive finally been off them for a year and a half now. Had been on them on a daily basis for ten years prior.",1706247236,kjmayta,t3_19fczxj,t3_19fczxj,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

You tapered right? I heard keto diet helped people quit diazepam much easier too

Memantine dosages?",1706283274,kjo37u4,t3_19fczxj,t1_kjmayta,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
disco_disaster,"Nah, not that I noticed. It was hard to distinguish a withdrawal from the PAW from the benzos.",1706290525,kjoog5s,t3_19fczxj,t1_kjnaapv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
disco_disaster,"Unfortunately, I quit cold turkey. I was forced to after I either lost my prescription or someone stole it. 

I picked up a three month prescription, and went home. I went to grab it later that night, and it was missing. 

It either fell out of my car, or someone stole it while I was getting gas. 

I had always wanted to get off of them, but I wish I could‚Äôve tapered.

Doctors do not take these drugs seriously enough. 

Thank you!

The withdrawal nearly ruined my life.

I took maybe 10-20mg of memantine per day. 

Honestly I would try other routes such as tapering instead of memantine. Maybe both?",1706290442,kjoo79v,t3_19fczxj,t1_kjo37u4,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
Hour-Yogurtcloset259,"Damn, you know it's very dangerous right?
Cold turkey benzos sounds scary, did you feel close to a stroke? I believe keto diet, magnesium picolinate, n acetyl cysteine, piracetam and ketamine/ or piracetam, micro dosing psylocibine and a healing üçÑ trip plus tapering would make it very easy, ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm happy you didn't get hurt :))
I know what a hell withdraws can be from quiting 2 years everyday high dosage of tramadol prescribed for terrible chronic pain after accident :x cold turkey it... Hell unleashed",1706315962,kjqo6ul,t3_19fczxj,t1_kjoo79v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
