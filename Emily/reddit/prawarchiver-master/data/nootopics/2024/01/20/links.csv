Currently at end of benzo taper and pre existing anxiety and ocd is bad .
Non stop ruminations of past events I’ve forgotten
About and doom . 

I used all the ssris in the past and discontinued due to
Adverse effects and inefficient .
Also history of drug use , mdma ect so serutonin receptors probs fried .

Atm for benzo taper been using Agmatine and acamprosate. 
Also on prescribed 50mg lamictal . 
Used bromantane and na selank during taper also . 

Have NAC at hand but too much causes depression and anhedonia. 

Once off this benzo , what’s best approach to help
Ocd / anxiety .?

Should I continue to target glutamate in brain and should I also focus on helping serotonin ? 

I also have lots of Cerebrolysin here . Would this help ? 

If so what’s best noots or supps to take as don’t wanna get on the psych med train again .

My guess is that it means an order of magnitude lower for the kg unit, so 0.2mg/kg^-1 = 0.2mg/100g or 2mg/kg?

But I feel like that might be incorrect because it seems like it would be really simple to just write 2mg/kg.
