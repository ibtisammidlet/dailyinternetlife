My Stack on that one was agmatine, PEA, Passionflower, kudzu and magnolia. Magnesium should be in as well. There is a good Video about that core stack on YouTube. Something like Supplements for benzo withdrawal good explanations on the scientific part. Be back if i find it.

paulm19855,"Lol man lyrica is what ended me up on this benzo 
The lyrica wd ended with me in hospital were the doc thought it was a smart idea to give benzo for it lol 
Off lyrica just last bit benzo to go 

What’s thoughts on magnolia during benzo wd , wouldn’t that delay recovery due to it impacting gaba a ? 
Yes on the magnesium , I use that 
Also using pea as read it increases allopregbenolone which helps gaba levels .
