Inner-Education2467,"CBG is A2 adenosine agonist, 

I nearly passed out after mu usual coffe (it was hand shaking strong) when day before I smoked CBG all day. 

Just dont take it before bed it agonise a2 adreno recetors also and fuck up sleep which suck :/",1705823297,kiv2aw8,t3_19bpa55,t3_19bpa55,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Complete_Still7584,"I've used agmatine, ketamine, meantime, and dextromethorphan for tolerance reversal from a bunch of different substances. Ketamine was the best and I used it with the burst dosing method which was used in studies with cancer patients lowering their dose of opiates. I used it every other or every two days a long with cdp choline for the memory issues ketamine causes. I weaned off Phenibut and Suboxone separately and resensitized my tolerance to my prescription Vyvanse. The substances I noticed that resensitized the quickest was caffeine and cannabis. It was a HUGE difference in effects, FAST. After only two burst doses of K; I could only take about 3-4 sips of coffee before I noticed it felt as if I drank it for the first time and couldn't continue to drink anymore.",1705861184,kix4qbg,t3_19bpa55,t3_19bpa55,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

(agmatine, dxm, memantine, zinc and magnesium)

antparts,"Caffeine tolerance will build. Caffeine resensitation can happen via abstinence. Ultimately, you will return to it for the wakeful sensation it delivers. If you rest, eat, and recover optimally caffeine or other substances won’t be necessary. 

When using caffeine it’s best to have a decent kickstart initially and then follow with smaller intermittent dosing. Try something like 150-200mg then 40-50mg every other hour all the while maintaining hydration. 

However you’re definitely not gonna do that sooooo…compounds like Semax and cerebrolysin can assist in resetting sensitivity. 1-2 cups of coffee is what I can handle comfortably while on Semax. Otherwise I house 32oz in the morning regularly.",1705825089,kiv4tjl,t3_19bpa55,t3_19bpa55,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

TrenAppreciator420,"Not sure via which mechanism this occurs, but memantine resets caffeine tolerance.

BDNFan,"Mind linking the source that shows CBG as an Adenosine-2 agonist? I couldn't find anything myself.

Also alpha2-AR is inhibitory so agonists before bed will likely increase sleep onset. ie clonidine/guanfacine [[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0009922813502123)] [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9536883/)] inducing sleep through inhibiting Locus Ceruleus activity.

qdouble,"He said he’s looking for something to promote wakefulness in the first sentence, so that’s why I said modafinil. 

I don’t think you can reverse caffeine tolerance, especially not in regard to wakefulness. I mostly just use caffeine because it still improves reaction time and other performance metrics even after you build tolerance.",1705803641,kitxbm2,t3_19bpa55,t1_kitwdv7,3,False,t5_4aoxhu
