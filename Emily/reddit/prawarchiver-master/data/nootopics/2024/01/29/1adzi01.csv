LucyEatsPlants,"Oxymetazoline's agonism of 5ht1 receptors is nearly as potent as its alpha-2a agonism and accordingly oxymetazoline has very different effects from what you'd expect with an adrenergic agonist (definitely in a bad way imo). This doesn't look much better with xylo

I suppose you could carefully try some on your own since it's otc in most places. Maybe you'll have good results who knows. Most people just report negative anxiety type symptoms from otc oxymetazoline. I've tried a much higher dose of oxymetazoline than the bottle says is safe (intranasally, high bioavailability) because I was curious too. I slowly worked my way up to like 25 squirts and I felt nothing other than maybe a little muscle weakness, faster heart rate and anxiety. I'm not convinced this wasn't just placebo, lots of decongestion and definite urinary retention though",1706556037,kk5alj5,t3_1adzi01,t3_1adzi01,4,False,t5_4aoxhu

Anecdotally whenever I’ve used Afrin in the past I’ve felt spaced out and I guess relaxed in a strange way. I have no idea if that’s from it agonizing PFC adrenergic receptors, placebo, or some other means. As nasal sprays should largely exert their effects topically rather than systemically, I’m not sure how much would end up in plasma after administration. ",1706571670,kk6k233,t3_1adzi01,t3_1adzi01,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

LucyEatsPlants,"5ht1 agonists such as buspirone, 5-meo-dmt and triptans are quite unpleasant acutely. Imagine having a pounding heart (or a slow one), being fatigued but unable to sleep, feeling nauseous, being dizzy, having uncomfortable bodily sensations and feeling anxious or depressed. There's definitely some therapeutic value for some of these substances, but if i wanted a clonidine-type drug than I would not want 5ht1rs as off-targets",1706666145,ko7z1gn,t3_1adzi01,t1_kkcbddn,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
