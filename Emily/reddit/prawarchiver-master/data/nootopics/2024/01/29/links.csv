With new evidence of binding affinities as well as older ligand analysis, imdazoline derived A2a agonists oxymetazoline and partial xylometazoline have been shown to have extremely high degrees of selectivity, on the order of hundred folds on A2a vs A2b and A2c. Furthermore, imdazoline derivatives have been shown to further induce activation of imdazoline-1 receptor, showing promise as another pathway in the treatment of ADHD, as shown in zebra fish using a pure imdazoline-1 receptor agonist.

The risk of valvulopathy is increased, although likely no more than the risk of guanfacine and clonidine. Seretonin receptors HT1a, HT1b, HT1c/2c are also activated by oxymetazoline and xylometazoline, although they seem to be much lower activity than A2 receptors.

The mechanism of traditional A2a agonists is the constant stimulation of post synaptic A2a adrenoreceptors leading to a downregulation of adrenergic sensitivity, leading to an inhibitory effect and increasing attention and behavioral inhibition.

The traditional difficulty of oxymetazoline and xylometazoline lies with their off target receptor activation profile and their short metabolic half-life, however, I believe that stable high level stimulation of Adrenoreceptors may be possible with the use of depot injections or transdermal administration, providing cheap, over the counter management of ADHD rivalling expensive prescription medication like Guanfacine and colonidine.",False,t5_4aoxhu,Utilization of the imdazoline derived highly selective A2a receptor agonist xylometazoline and partial agonist oxymetazoline for increased neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex in the treatment of ADHD in comparison to traditional slow selective A2a receptor agonists guanfacine and clonidine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1adzi01/utilization_of_the_imdazoline_derived_highly/
