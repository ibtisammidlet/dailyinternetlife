I'll make a premise, I'm not a novice to nootropics and psychotropic drugs, NSI 189 is a molecule that I think has enormous potential if used correctly, and which I believe is underestimated for three reasons: 

\- the first is that in the second phase of the trials it did not prove to be more effective than placebo as an antidepressant, but by the study authors' own admission, the depression measurement scale referred to obsolete guidelines.  

\- second, the antidepressant effect could actually be the exact opposite if not used correctly, since as we know, it increases the emotional response, which can be an advantage in a phase in which depression is in a phase of apathy that lasts for a long time but a disadvantage if you are in a phase of strong anguish and/or sadness  

 \- third, the dose of 40mg per day I suspect, after months of anecdotes collected, and from personal experience, is really too much  

 Starting from these three points, I'll tell you how my approach was. I started using nsi in September 2023, in freebase form, at a dose of 20mg die. I was depressed and apathetic. Within a week my emotions returned but I had great brain fog and severe anxiety, as well as an incredible headache, a mess. Furthermore, after about 10 days I became really too emotional and sad. So I reduced the NSI to 10mg die and to make a long story short:

the positive sides remained, the negative ones attenuated. 

Not only that, I went from mental fog to excellent focus and great energy, improved memory but the anxiety remained. After about 2 months however the anxiety was becoming too strong and I stopped it. Do you know when you think you've found something really good but you need to learn how to use it? 

Well, I had this in mind and I would try again until I found a way to make it work. By experimenting with doses, times and methods of intake, I came to the conclusion that intranasal intake at 5mg is, at least for me, the perfect option. I think it has become my favorite nootropic, 

I'll tell you what effects I find:  

\- childish sense of curiosity 

\- it gives you so much focus that it allows you to do boring things without getting demotivated 

\- high sociability and, STRANGELY, a sense of self-confidence and indifference to criticism, almost zen 

\- general optimism 

\- increase in memory at least in the short term 

\- sense of calm and peace with the world  

the only downside is that a very slight anxiety appears towards the evening but it is really very manageable. I'd be curious to know if anyone else has experiences like this lately ",False,t5_4aoxhu,"NSI-189 intranasally, let's (re)talk about it",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1957wsx/nsi189_intranasally_lets_retalk_about_it/
