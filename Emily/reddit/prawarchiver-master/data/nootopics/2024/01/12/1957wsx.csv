SLYMON_BEATS,"I have yet to try it, but I’ve heard a common complaint while it intensifies good emotions it also intensifies the bad as well. So I think it would be more useful if used under the right conditions when you aren’t going through a rough patch",1705332475,khz5b9s,t3_1957wsx,t3_1957wsx,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

liukk___,"it's true, it tends to amplify both. However, with a kind of ""microdosing"" and administered intranasally, I noticed that emotions in general have certainly increased, but I process them in a different way, for example:  
if something hurts me, I can get over it and move forward with much more clarity than before. it's as if there was a general underlying optimism, which makes me manage everything better. I can assure you that I have felt negative emotions since I started 5mg IN, but I repeat, I process them in a more rational way, even if it may seem counterintuitive. Obviously these anecdotes have no scientific evidence worthy of note as NSI at such low doses and via the intratransal route has not been studied.",1705338713,khzn3un,t3_1957wsx,t1_khz5b9s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Collationem,"My experience with NSI is that it's a highly potent nootropic, mostly what OP describes. However, the emotional amplifier effect is a bit bothersome at the standard 40mg dose. Curiously both TAK-653 and IDRA-21 also amplify emotions for me. I have also found with neurogenics in general that they make me inattentive and worsen my ADHD for the duration they are taken. Dihexa is the most potent and turns my mild ADHD into extreme ADHD.",1705610645,kihlrsf,t3_1957wsx,t1_khz5b9s,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
liukk___,"I don't know for sure but I don't see why not. In reality, however, oral bioavailability is high and intranasal administration is not necessary or even studied, but I and others find that it works",1705590089,kifxf7z,t3_1957wsx,t1_kiflxcl,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
