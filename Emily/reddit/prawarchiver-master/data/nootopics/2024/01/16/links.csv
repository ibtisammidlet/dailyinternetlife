So the idea is to support the nutrient depletion, but also to support cognition and memory function (my biggest symptomatic problem) in general.

&#x200B;

Morning:

Breakfast with;

1x Omega-3 Fish Oil Triple Strength 1000mg (Nootropics Depot)

1x Thorne Basic Nutrients

1x Synapsa Bacopa Monnieri 320mg (Nootropics Depot)

1x Cognizin Citicoline 250mg (Nootropics Depot)

&#x200B;

An hour before bed:

2x Magnesium Magnesium L-Threonate (Nootropics Depot)

L-Theanine 200mg (Nootropics Depot)

Melatonin 300mcg (Nootropics Depot)

&#x200B;

I currently take Citiciline 200mg and think I might be experiencing signs choline depression, which leads me to wonder if I should cycle it, switch it for Alpha-GPC?

Or maybe switch it out for Uridine before bed?

I'm also unsure if the Bacopa Monnieri will have any effect in this stack at all? Considering it might have a sedating effect.

Also, would it be beneficial to add Lemon Balm to the before bed stack? I'm currently taking it with L-Theanine (Life Extension's ""Stress Relief"") and it does seem to help me fall asleep faster, and stay asleep during the night.

Any other recommendations?",False,t5_4aoxhu,Vyvanse stack advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1988tmr/vyvanse_stack_advice/
