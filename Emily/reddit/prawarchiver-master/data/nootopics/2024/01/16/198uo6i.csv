wvkid101,"The crude extract is schisandra powder put through a bunch of solvents and dried.

Schisandra is dopaminergic as is. It should lower prolactin by existing. P5P, a vitamin, is much more potent for this. 

Also, just a heads up. The journal you cited isn’t known for being the highest quality and the publisher is known to accept papers almost exclusively based on cash.",1705498394,ki9yt7h,t3_198uo6i,t3_198uo6i,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

wvkid101,"I’m not 100% sure it’s the exact same MOA, but they both operate with more dopaminergic signaling stopping prolactin release. 

I can’t find how schisandra works, but it looks like it’s a reuptake inhibitor/enzyme blocker that increases the effect of dopamine that’s still there. P5P increases the amount of dopamine (amongst a LOT of other very good things) that’s produced. I think you could use them synergistically. 

[Here’s a paper on P5P helping prolactin related issues.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.681418/full) If you have a condition with prolactin, you might want to look into cabergoline. I’ve got a long history with it, but it made my prolactin undetectable after having a brain cyst.",1705503274,kiaas6j,t3_198uo6i,t1_kia3n13,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
