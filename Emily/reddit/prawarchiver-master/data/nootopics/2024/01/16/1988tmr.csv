Outrageous-Sea1657,"Interesting, I am in a similar position and have a similar stack. I would swap out the Melatonin as you shouldn't really take that for more than three days at a time - can replace with Lemon Balm. I also take higher doses: 500mg of.L-Theanine and CDP-Choline. 500mg of L-Phenylalanine is also something to look into.",1705429118,ki5osf4,t3_1988tmr,t3_1988tmr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Single-Golf-2223,"I am looking into something similar.

This is just my initial thoughts. I would do Bacopa at night. Some evidence it decreases dopamine and makes those who take it very tired. Could negate ADHD meds a little. So would do it closer to afternoon after peak effects from ADHD meds are gone.

I do Mag Threonate and Melatonin before bed too. Both are great. 

You could look into ALCAR since it is neuroprotective and helps with energy metabolism in the brain. 

I use Modafinil instead of Vyanese (I have undiagnosed ADHD).",1705433512,ki62elt,t3_1988tmr,t3_1988tmr,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

KitteySenpai,"That is very interesting haha. Thanks for the advice! 
Was considering that swap. Do you think Lemon Balm and Uridine (instead of choline in the morning) would be a good combo for sleep? 
Considering that Citicoline seems to be giving me depressive symptoms?
I will tinker with the dosages as I go, with L-Theanine for exemple.

KitteySenpai,"I used to be on 60mg which gave me lots of sides, felt wired during the day and developed Paradoxical Insomnia.
Slowly went down to 30mg during the past months, and so far my biggest side is sleep problems; Taking about an hour to fall sleep and waking up during the night/not getting REM sleep. So I'm a bit tired on the daily.

Otherwise no other big sides, slight head throbb and thirsty but thats about it haha. 
The meds last around 12 hours, with the first 4hours after 1 hour of ingestion being rather strong, then it starts mellowing out. I don't really ""feel it"" in the afternoon (i.e not wired anymore/intended effect) but it still works, and I can still study without any issues.",1705486230,ki9efbs,t3_1988tmr,t1_ki8z7cd,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Outrageous-Sea1657,"I haven't taken Uridine or Bacopa before so can't comment - will look into it (I'm a fan of Ashwagandha which I take sporadically as needed several times a week usually). If CDP-Citicoline is causing problems, I just wouldn't take it, for me it really makes a positive difference in terms of mental clarity and calmness (perhaps your brain has enough naturally / doesn't need it). L-Phenylalanine is just another route to get Dopamine, I feel 'well supplemented' with 500mg of Phenylalanine and 500mg of Theanine every morning, although I don't take L-Dopa or similar extracts.

PabloAnnie,"The idea is usually to pair >700mg DHA (fish oil) + Uridine + Choline source, 
You could try choline bitartrate if both alpha-GPC and CDP-choline induce depression. Also can try lowering your dose. Check out Mr. happy stack thread on Longecity forum. Because you also need some extra vitamins like folate and Vit-E.

Please come back after a while and post your results!

EDIT: They specifically say to introduce choline SLOWLY starting with 50mg only and switching to bitartrate if you get depressive state. Eating lots of eggs also brings a lot of choline usually without side-effects.

Apigenin is also interesting if you're looking to upregulate amount of GABA in the brain (it reduces conversion of GABA to Glutamate, but it needs daily use for a while to start noticing effects",1705444962,ki70w72,t3_1988tmr,t1_ki6ae50,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

VariationWeary6063,"Yes, but it can make more choline available that would typically be metabolized into tmg.

KitteySenpai,"Great, thank you!
Honestly I haven't been able to tell if CDP-Choline is giving me any positive effects, mainly because my sleep is a bit shit (7ish hours per night) due to not being able to stay asleep during the night.
But I did try Alpha-GPC, 150mg, at one point which gave a headache, so I'm not really sure about choline overall.

Will look into L-Phenylalanine. Uridine is supposed to replenish or upregulate dopamine which is why I thought it interesting.

I take 1x Thorne Basic Nutrients with my 30mg Vyvanse every morning to get a good amount of B-Vitamins :)",1705485187,ki9d28p,t3_1988tmr,t1_ki9c2v6,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
KitteySenpai,"Thanks!
I've looked into the MrHappyStack before and have considered it. But since I'm unsure regarding choline (Alpha-GPC gave me a headache at 150mg daily, and I can't tell if CDP-Choline is causing the depressiva symptoms or if it's the poor/lack of sleep).

Currently I do take 1x Thorne Basic Nutrients in the morning with my Vyvanse, Super Omega-3 (Life Extension, 700EPA and 500DHA) and 250mg Citicoline in the morning. The only thing missing would be the Uridine, which I don't believe I can take at the same time as my medication due to the Dopaminergic upregulation since I don't want to feel wired haha.

AH that might be why, I didn't start slowly with the CDP-Choline, I started directly at 250mg every morning for about 1-2weeks.
I don't quite seem to understand the difference between the different Choline sources, e.g GPC vs CDP, got any thoughts on that?

I looked into Apigenin as well, but long term effects made me wary, and from what I've read it might not mix well with Vyvanse.",1705485732,ki9drgz,t3_1988tmr,t1_ki70w72,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Taking TMG limits the amount of choline that is used for the methylation process. Allowing it to be used elswhere.

People who are sensitive to choline supplementation  can take TMG and not have to supplement as much choline, reducing the risk of choline related depression.

I've seen suggestion that up to half of choline supplementation can be substituted with TMG.",1705678378,killas1,t3_1988tmr,t1_kil3o7g,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
