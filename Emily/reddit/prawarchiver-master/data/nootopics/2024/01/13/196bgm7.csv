johneistin,Maybe you could compare to 4-ap or coluracetam?,1705229722,khstw4f,t3_196bgm7,t3_196bgm7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
AromaticPlant8504,Do you feel any different like less/more anxious or more energetic/more flat?,1705233324,khsyxix,t3_196bgm7,t3_196bgm7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
HyperPopped-a-lyrica,Is this a good nicotine alternative? Maybe could help quitting nicotine,1705663909,kikp6l0,t3_196bgm7,t3_196bgm7,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"I didn't try coloracetam. But i did try others like faso-/nefi-/phenylpi-racetam etc

Its completely different I'd argue. See my reply to another comment here, where I go in more detail

I'd say racetams are more targeted at increasing working memory rather than field of focus",1705354486,ki0yz4f,t3_196bgm7,t1_khstw4f,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"Its like, not more energetic or alert, so no increased attention (as far as I can notice)..

..But it seems to make a massive impact on focus, like my field of focus is broader and 'healthier' making me think about more relevant information and thus increasing the chances that I act on what is best for me (in my eyes). 

Before, during the last period where I'd feel a bit impaired cognitively.. I'd hold like only 1 interest in mind each new day. So I simply did my responsibilities when they popped up urgently, ignored the ones I could and spend the whole day solely on that 1 thing. Not being very helpful for getting a balanced life.

Now I have back a broad area of interest again, eg: thinking about working out, going somewhere, planning for school, fantasing about my future etc

Kinda like I got stuck in always having my adhd-hyperfocus but abt-089 rescued me (without decreasing my concentration)",1705354274,ki0ycgi,t3_196bgm7,t1_khsyxix,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Some people use it to help them quit nicotine, indeed.
It's been two days now for me, I did not completely quit nicotine (I don't plan that for now) but I vape much less.

I have the same feeling that OP with this substance, it seems to help for focus and it seems to have a positive effect on mood. I don't think working memory is affected (for that, there are many things. Tak and Racetams for working memory, PRL for information retention)

The effects are quite subtle and what I say is just anecdotal but I think I can say it's definitely not a placebo and a very interesting substance.",1705667578,kikvdbf,t3_196bgm7,t1_kikp6l0,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Legitimate_Banana512,"Yes np. It is still anecdotal tho.

On the one hand I have a lot of experience, used a wide variety of substances and used some substances enough to tell a difference. If the impact is high enough I can accurately describe it. 

On the other hand Im a bit insensitive to lots of compounds, including most nootropics. So contradictively the effects must be of high enough impact for me to be 100% sure, which I thus can't guarantee now (its not as impactful/noticable as taking stimulants eg)

Although theoretically it could make sense. And theoretically it likely does more good than harm.

Additionally subtlety is often prefered for practical use of nootropics, contradictably to it being undesirable for analysing its effects",1705409889,ki48nz8,t3_196bgm7,t1_ki1r6lr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Just a little followup after more than 15 days. 

My impressions have not changed much: less urge to vape (especially in the morning), an increase in focus during the day (but no tunnel vision at all), a bit less irritability than usually.

I also confirm that while the half life is short, its effects seem persistant during the whole day.

A good compound, which can seem mild at first glance but which have a real nootropic activity in the background.",1707329555,kpd3mjn,t3_196bgm7,t1_kil22on,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

HyperPopped-a-lyrica,Is it comparable to noopept or other racetams in how it feels?,1707394277,kph283r,t3_196bgm7,t1_kpd3mjn,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Legitimate_Banana512,"I always follow the dosage given in the site (volume devided by the given ""estimated use"" parameter.

So that'd be 1ml ABT-089=> 4 mg

Also, I do use tropisetron. They do not clash but both affect the family of nicotonic receptors.. at 0,25mL=> 5 mg

Im 105 KG.",1705522752,kibxbc7,t3_196bgm7,t1_kibr6aa,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Efik_Pail,"Although it's not the same mode of action, it's relatively comparable, in a way.
It's not as obviously noticeable but it lasts longer, it's a more diffuse effect.

I don't have ADHD at all but I often have some trouble focussing. ABT helps, it's a very smooth focusing effect.",1707396283,kph5yho,t3_196bgm7,t1_kph283r,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
