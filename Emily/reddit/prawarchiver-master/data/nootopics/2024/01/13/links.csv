I know studies said you have to use it multiple days before it starts having a significant effect, thus I will make a report later again. But I feel like it might be starting to work.

The past time, at least the last year, I haven't been feeling myself cognitively and emotionally. Tbh, I also abused stimulants. Stimulants reduce acetylcholine and I also 'felt' like I lacked that. So I thought I'd give abt-089 a shot.

I'm starting to be thinking more sanely, less obsessed/narowily focused on small issues. I'm starting to think more like before, healthy. Focussing better what is relevant and not in the big picture. Before I'd be able to see that, but almost immediately forget it.

I know this might still be placebo, so be critical. Might report back later again",False,t5_4aoxhu,"Abt-089, first 4 days",https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/196bgm7/abt089_first_4_days/
