Alksfrench,"It's a great memory enhancer. It took me a while to get used to it : it worsened my sleep (dreams too vivid) and sometimes my speech when i started but now after 1 year on and off i enjoy it. I take 2,5mg-3mg first thing in the morning when i plan to study",1705236051,kht332y,t3_196cyy7,t3_196cyy7,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
Optimal_Shape_2916,"It is the best nootropic I’ve encountered thus far.

Synergistic with Neboglamine too.

Dont take it in the evenings unless you are ready for highly vivid dreams and potentially lucid dreams",1705265358,khv6jt3,t3_196cyy7,t3_196cyy7,8,False,t5_4aoxhu
SLYMON_BEATS,"The IQ increase claims are bologna. From what I remember, this claim comes from someone that took two different Mensa tests (Denmark vs another one). These test have different g loadings and there isn’t data available regarding the norms, thus you can’t make a claim that your iq increased +7 when you take a completely different. Very dumb claim that takes away from a great product like tak-653",1705280177,khwcsrh,t3_196cyy7,t3_196cyy7,6,False,t5_4aoxhu
