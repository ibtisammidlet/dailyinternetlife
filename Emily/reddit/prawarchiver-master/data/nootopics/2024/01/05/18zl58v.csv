DiegPosts,"Start low. Any alcar with eggs causes depression for me. It might also be more reasonable to take 500mg with three eggs in the morning, and then 1000mg later.",1704504864,kgiu4yt,t3_18zl58v,t3_18zl58v,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

qdouble,"I take 1,500mg of ALCAR + 300mg of CDP Choline and have eggs for breakfast everyday. No issues. However, some people are much more sensitive to choline, so you might just have to see how you respond to different doses.

Oopsimapanda,You have nothing to lose by starting small. You really don't want to fall off the cliff into cholinergic crisis - and that much choline is getting into dangerous territory. Can see my post history for what happens if that occurs. Be careful!,1704570067,kgmi14l,t3_18zl58v,t3_18zl58v,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Decent-Boysenberry72,"As a choline dominant person I can chug as many grams of phenylpiracetam as I want all day no problem, but if I touch a choline source besides breakfast I get brain fog and depression.",1704732058,kgwy6pt,t3_18zl58v,t1_kgiu4yt,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
