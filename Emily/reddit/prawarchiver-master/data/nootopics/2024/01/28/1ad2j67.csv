Doctordup,"It helps more with brain processing speed not depersonalization. I've used it. Currently on a break. Didn't do much but move my brain processing speed up 1Hz. I work in a brain specialty clinic (not licensed, not a doctor, not med advice) and we do EEGs (brain mapping). When I took TAK-653, it moved my brain processing speed up 1Hz which is a pretty big deal. But other than quick thinking, it didn't do much more than that.",1706454980,kjyj1wq,t3_1ad2j67,t3_1ad2j67,11,False,t5_4aoxhu

Doctordup,"I chose P21 over Cere. I had a brain injury in my frontal lobe from inflammation from long Covid 2x and it showed on EEG both times. The P21 helped with word retrieval and brain fog.

Doctordup,"P21 helped with brain fog and word retrieval. I was astounded with Epithalon. It lit up my frontal lobe like a Christmas tree. I was not expecting any brain effects from it. 

The only issue with Epithalon for me is I have to take it early in the day as opposed to taking it at night like most people do. If I don't take it early in the day, I end up waking up at 3am feeling like I got a long 8 hour refreshing sleep and I'm wide awake. I compare Epithalon sleep to propofol sleep. If you've ever had a procedure and woke up well rested, that's kind of how Epithalon makes me feel. People talk about longevity, telomeres, and sleep with Epithalon but it increases my REM significantly. Having long Covid, I haven't had much REM in four years until Epithalon. Highly recommended. Please note dosing online everywhere is incorrect. In order to have good research outcomes, only 500mcg daily for 20 days is necessary — not the 5mg to 10mg incorrectly stated all over the internet.",1706951952,kopt557,t3_1ad2j67,t1_kohzzbh,2,False,t5_4aoxhu

Doctordup,I'm doing a new protocol developed by a biochemist friend. He's doing 10 days on Epithalon and 20 days off. So I'm doing 500mcg the 1st-10th of the month then off for the rest of the month. It's working really well for me doing it this way. No issues. I just take mine in the morning or at least by noon.,1707515207,kpp2r1y,t3_1ad2j67,t1_kopttrj,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
