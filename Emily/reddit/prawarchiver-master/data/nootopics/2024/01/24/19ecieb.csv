Efik_Pail,"I did not know about this combo.

EGCG seems quite sustainable if you are reasonable with the dosage (some guy on the web destroyed his liver with green tea extracts but he took absurdly high doses)

Bromantane has a very good safety profile.
I tend to cycle it, I don't know how it would go if I took it every day without break but long cycles are completely ok.",1706094079,kjc1frc,t3_19ecieb,t3_19ecieb,6,False,t5_4aoxhu

Chika4a,"I think that's probably placebo, which doesn't minder the benefits.   
I used EGCG with and without bromatane and never felt a difference. Especially, ""60% improvement of anhedonia"" will probably not happen because of EGCG. Days and circumstances can change and with it anhedonia.   


Nevertheless, EGCG has multiple benefits, but mostly not nootropic ones. One of these benefits is stopping collagenase, thus theoretically reducing skin aging.

Make sure to lower the dose of EGCG to max 300mg. You will probably get liver damage and a negative change in your lipid panel with a dosage of 800Â mg.
