It’s a proven cognitive-enhancer in healthy adults without addiction

& works via α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonism

(without activating addictive α4β2 receptors) 

Also blocks 5-HT3 which is:

- Nootropic
- Anxiolytic
- Anti-nausea
- Antidepressant

2. Rhodiola Rosea: An adaptogen that can help with stress, fatigue, and cognitive function. It's known for enhancing concentration and mental stamina, particularly during stressful periods like exams.

FrogFister,"The lethargy and tiredness that comes with it I was managing with adding more exercise from my part and even coffee and what not, but what got to me eventually to stop using it was the fact that it caused me to wake up too early. Perhaps it was my current chemistry back then. It does have a nice effect, however my priority is increasing my dopamine bowl now and Bacopa is not helping with that, quite on the contrary - but if you have a chill life, you might not notice it, but I need my dopamine reserves full to serve me.

FrogFister,"Think of your dopamine as a cookie jar, naturally whenever you take a cookie or more, you feel good and usually you associate whatever you did before and during taking and eating the cookie. Negative feedback loop activities such as alcohol, porn masturbating, weed binge, eating Lays and doritos processed sugary foods, they give you some dopamine but in the long run they come with different bags of problems, from tolerance to insulin resistance to lower dopamine baseline and so on, you already know anyway. Most people use these to cope, or because it seems normal and 'everyone does it'. Cutting them all at once will turn your brain against you for a time, so gradual changes is best. Is not really about dopamine detoxing, but more about implementing new positive feedback loop habits which on the long run they bring positive stuff in their baggage. You can think of installing DLCs or addons in your brain when you try to form a new habit, you need willpower to force yourself to do it for around 2 months or less so that by that time the habit is made, you no longer use willpower and u are automated, as u already are with many negative feedback loops. See Bruce Lipton podcast any u can find on youtube to explain you this perspective of 'installing programs'. Next, ALCAR upregulates dopamine. even coffee although u can become tolerant to it. CDP-Choline (citicoline) can increase the density of dopamine receptors. Of course some piracetam can make it run smoothly as well so you don't end up with excess floating choline.  There is also Bromantane sublingually but i only recommend it for maximum a month after that move on. And of course Gingko Biloba long term. You need sun early in the day, and always wear in the evening orange/red blue light blockers, it is crucial to fix your circadhian rythm. Sleep before midnight, if you sleep after midnight, your dopamine will suffer the most, more powerful than sups. And in general exercise even daily walks helps in upregulating a shit ton of stuff. Make sure u are not deficient in minerals and shit, be patient. If you need a quick spike in dopamine, a cold shower can help, i use it strategically instead of brainless always. Oh, there is also Sulbuthiamine which lowers your dopamine in the moment only for when you stop using it, to bounce back higher increasing your baseline, is the reverse effect of when you use drugs such as alcohol or weed binging when you lower your dopamine baseline over time because you force the high daily, so with Sulbuthiamine (a type of B1) you lower it for it to bounce back higher when you stop - but let me tell you, has odds offects in people, sometimes made me feel energetic other times i felt tranquil and weird i just couldn't go long term with it, but Sulbuthiamine is said to speed up dopamine 'recovery' in 2-3 months what you'd normally get in 1 year of sobriety..  Out of all of these i think 10k steps a day+alcar empty stomach is a good start. Think of your dopamine as a cookie jar, whenever you stay on tiktok for hours, you are picking cookies from that jar, then when you think about going for a run, you can't get much anticipation-cookie form the jar as you already feel full and jar feels empty for the day.. Good luck, but you don't need it :) Now, shill me some altcoins please, lol.",1705480026,ki969sz,t3_18xkopf,t1_ki7f5yd,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
CryptoEscape,"Great info thank you.

been working hard to restore my dopamine.

Almost completely off Kratom after a six year addiction to it….really messed up my hormones.

Why only one month on Bromantane?  I was considering 6-8 weeks.

Def hear ya on the Sulbutiamine….it would sometimes make me anhedonic, sometimes a bit energized….it was weird and unpredictable….then I hear reports saying 2-4 week cycles work best to up-regulate dopamine, and others saying don’t take it more than 3 days or you get tolerance to the acute effects.

Interesting how you could essentially induce a dopamine comedown on the front end, then reap the benefits later.

100% agree on the exercise and sunlight.

I work second shift so unfortunately I usually go to bed at midnight….might need to reconsider a new job if it’s that bad….I def wake up super fatigued a lot.",1705525630,kic6312,t3_18xkopf,t1_ki969sz,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
FrogFister,">Interesting how you could essentially induce a dopamine comedown on the front end, then reap the benefits later.

Indeed, I think it's not yet so known but one day this will become a trend.

Well if you google *Bromantane alzheimer plaque reddit* and open several tabs of threads talking about it, you will see some people worry and some not worrying about that one study where they injected massive doses of bromantane in rats and the rats developed plaque as how alheimers patients have. but they used mega doses and iirc is found recently that u can have plaque and not have alzheimer or have alz and not hav plaq as well. it upregulates the enzyme that also makes more plaque? best would be to check all those threads if you google that. 

there are many things against that anyway, polygala, agmatine, curcumin etc I take 50mg sublingually empty stomach: you won't feel much if u take it today and then in a different day, it's not like alcar. bromantane starts working like an old train, it builds up, so in 4-5 days or a week give or take of daily intake, you will definitely start to feel it. would be best to use this motivation to implement new habits and healthy routines. a cycle of few weeks should be fine, i don't think it's what is going to cause you alz decades from now, we put more questionable substances in your body without knowing. 

also i read somewhere bromantane works great with coffee also. so is not a substance i would take forever but at least it is helping me a lot now to regain motivation after 2 years of weed binging, i feel like regaining my mind back: of course,e i also take piracetam, citicoline, gingko biloba, d3, and in the evening fish oil and magnesium etc. i don't take alcar every day, but almost. if my sleep starts to suffer i take a break of a few days from alcar, mostly because it's motivating and energizing :)  


I recommend you try to find a new job continuously until you find one. is not worth to work in shift like that and you know it as well. try and try until you find and despair only if you don't try, not if you can't find :)",1705699698,kincunm,t3_18xkopf,t1_kic6312,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
