neural circuit involving the PrL→avBNST and its role in mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Can we do something to impact this circuit?pre-limbic region (PrL) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (avBNST). The PrL is associated with regulating emotions, while the avBNST plays a role in modulating stress, anxiety, and depression. The glutaminergic neurons are activated in these brain regions and their activation alliviates depression according to what i understood of this study

For new year I want finally quit nicotine in all forms. I used snus the entire time and started because of my final exams. The downside was that nicotine sometimes comes with an addiction. So it got me.

Nicotine is still the best nootropic for me because it gives me clear focus and strong motivation to keep learning the stuff for my next exam. (Naturopathy)

Do you have experience with other substances which are like nicotine or come close to the effect?
