Cholinergics - anxiety, choline depression


NAC ashwaghanda - risk of anhedonia


Sunifiram - lack of research and obsolete

Upset_Scientist3994,"St. Johns Wort is very tendencious to interact with just about everything as warned by one doctor of which I had. May cause liver damage. Or mayby to nullify effect of other nootropics, or everything in between. It works via affecting some liver enzymes activity, and that is problematic target potentially precisely because of interaction potential what may follow. At least that I would drop out instantly.

Since the plant grows wild in many roadsides and meadows I have picked it a lot and thrown into my stack, but not anymore after learning all that. So I have it a lot in my closet unused. One thing about it, that your hands gradually turn purple when touching fresh flowers of it when picking bare handed. Seems like some phytochemicals there are pretty strong when they can do that thing even thru the skin.",1704461453,kgfgy2x,t3_18z5lpo,t3_18z5lpo,3,False,t5_4aoxhu

Bierak,"It is difficult to know, but from my experience, from what I have read about the experience of others and what I have read about in articles, what could most interact negatively in your stack are the following:
St Johns Wort+Kanna+5-htp+Rhodiola.
Drop St Johns Wort...

Sunifiram+Fasoracetam. Also there are no long Term studies about sunifiram safety, however it Is a powerful cognitive enhancer.

If I were you, I would leave the stack like this:
Curcumin, Phenylalanine+NALT, ALCAR, Lipoic Acid, CoQ10, PQQ, Sodium Butyrate, Magnesium, Phosphatidylcholine, Rhodiola, Kanna, Resveratrol, Huperzine A, NAC, Ginkgo, Cistanche, Aniracetam, Tryptophan, Uridine, Vitamina B, D, Lutein, Bromantane.

Bierak,"The reason is that I removed the redundant from your stack, the excess of serotonin also.
If I were you, I would do this:
AM: PQQ, CoQ10, ALCAR, Lipoic Acid, Vitamin B and D, Lutein, Magnesium, Phosphatidylcholine and Bromantane 

After 15 - 30 min: Tryptophan, Phenylalanine and NALT.

PM 13:00 - 14:00: Huperzine, Ginkgo, Rhodiola, Cistanche, Curcumin, Aniracetam.

Afternoon: NAC. 

Try to look when to take Kanna, Uridine and Suni...
Uridine can be Taken at night for restoring Dopaminergic receptor when wake Up but it depends if it gives you insomia. 

Basically I Will try to take all the ""natural"" supplements in one shot. Wait Some hours and take the herbal shot.

Bromantane in the AM, and then I would take the catecholamine precursors when Bromantane Is in the system. 

Try to know how your body reacts.",1704755753,kgywvij,t3_18z5lpo,t1_kgufzlw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
Bierak,"Another option AM: ALCAR, PQQ, CoQ10, Magnesium, NALT+Phenylalanine, Phosphatidylcholine, Vitamin B and D, Lutein, Bromantane (Perhaps Huperzine here).
This Will give you an instant shot of Energy, motivation and well being... Basically increased catecholamine synthesis, increased ATP output, low inflammation.
You could add Uridine here also.

Then in the AM: Ginkgo, Cistanche, Rhodiola, Resveratrol, Curcumin. 

Aniracetam could be added in the AM or PM, it all depends on how you react.

Can't speak too much about Kanna, have never Taken it. So don't know how it reacts with the other supps.

NAC in the Afternoon or before to sleep with melatonin.",1704756075,kgyxqzs,t3_18z5lpo,t1_kgufzlw,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Yesterday I took stack as I mentioned and they seemed to do some help, without any bad effects. But two days ago when I added some phenylalanine to it, I felt very dull and terribly impared for hours until I got to sleep.

blizzardboy,"Yeah choline does that. But I would say, best thing to do is stop. Taking everything, wait a bit so you can get back to baseline. Supplements get give you a high in the short term but that will not last. And there’s no way to know what is causing what because there are too many factors. Stop everything, drink WATER and wait one or two weeks, then add one supplement at a time and see what the effects are. I’ve been there with antipsychotics and I know it’s stressful but you’re fine, you just need a bit of time without anything in your system.
