Upset_Scientist3994,"Maitake mushroom is also some sort of natural ampakine, and availible if racetams are not, coupled with some immunity boosting and other beneficial effects. Just like nobiletin is natural stuff, so availible when racetams not like for customs issue what I struggle with. 

But I wonder that I have not seen any anecdotes on how effective that could be, not here. Only couple science papers, but user anecdotes would be cool. Would not be bad service for the rest if TAK & Maitake combo could be experimented instead of Nobiletin?",1706706030,ko9x1bx,t3_1af8rbr,t3_1af8rbr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
fawkerzzz,"Was just reading about this, 

1. **AMPA Receptor Augmentation**:
   * [Nobiletin has been shown to **augment AMPA receptor activity** and **long-term potentiation** in cell culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobiletin)[^(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobiletin). This suggests that it may enhance synaptic transmission via postsynaptic AMPA receptors.
   * [Specifically, nobiletin likely up-regulates synaptic transmission by stimulating **PKA-mediated phosphorylation** of the AMPA receptor subunit **GluR1** in the hippocampus](https://eurekamag.com/research/021/427/021427187.php)[^(2)](https://eurekamag.com/research/021/427/021427187.php).

Pretty interesting that it can bind to glutamate receptors and protect from glutamate induced neurotoxicity. I will be purchasing some to test this out. Where you dosing 250mg nobiletin and 2mg tak?",1707399872,kphdoxk,t3_1af8rbr,t3_1af8rbr,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
