Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about it. It seems like nootropic source is kind of a repack dropshipping machine with no real face. Sometimes, orders get messed up.

I'd be kind of surprised if they checked the email more than weekly.

If you got a different item, you could see if someone else would like it, or you could stick it in the fridge? You might find a use for it later. 

If the item is damaged, then I would continue to contact.

I've bought stuff from them before that seemed alright, but frankly, nootropic source is not known as the most reliable or accurate vendor in the noot game.

Furthermore, there's speculation that some items sent are just repacked noots that give a similar effect.",1706045920,kj98x30,t3_19dp19s,t3_19dp19s,2,False,t5_4aoxhu
