Vye7,"Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations
Cardiovascular effects
Cardiovascular effects including atrioventricular (AV) block, bradycardia, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, sinoatrial nodal rhythm disorder, and syncope may occur with guanfacine use in all ages (Ref).

Mechanism : Dose-related; related to the pharmacologic action (ie, stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors resulting in decreased sympathetic activity leading to decreased heart rate, peripheral resistance, cardiac output, and blood pressure) (Ref).

Onset: Varied; occur most often in the first month of therapy and are usually transient. Tolerance to hypotensive effect develops with continued use (Ref).

Risk factors

• History of bradycardia, hypotension, or syncope

• Dehydration

• Cardiovascular disease (Ref)

• Cardiac conduction abnormalities (Ref)

• Concomitant use of sympatholytic medications (eg, beta blockers, alpha blockers, mixed α,β-blockers)

• Concurrent antihypertensives

CNS effects
CNS effects including drowsiness, insomnia, sedated state, and headache have been reported in adult and pediatric patients (Ref). Sedation and drowsiness may impair physical or mental abilities. Although not life-threatening, these effects commonly result in nonadherence and/or discontinuation of therapy (Ref).

Mechanism : Dose-related; related to the pharmacologic action (ie, activates alpha-2 adrenoreceptors which inhibits the release of norepinephrine [needed for arousal]), CNS effects result when norepinephrine is not present (Ref).

Onset: Intermediate; occurs early in treatment (ie, first few weeks after initiation) and with dose increases; transient and usually resolve with continued use (Ref).

Risk factors:

• Higher doses

• Concomitant treatment with medications with sedative effects (eg, antihistamines, centrally active depressants such phenothiazines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines)

• Concomitant alcohol use

Withdrawal syndrome/rebound Hypertension
Withdrawal syndrome including symptoms resembling nervousness and anxiety (eg, increased heart rate), and rebound hypertension may occur with abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine in all ages (Ref).

Mechanism : Withdrawal; result of excessive plasma catecholamine levels, “catecholamine surge”.

Onset: Rapid; Gradual increase back to baseline pretreatment blood pressures after drug discontinuation; blood pressure readings significantly above pretreatment readings have also been reported (Ref).

Risk factors:

• Higher doses (Ref)

• Longer duration of treatment (Ref)

• Abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine (eg, medication nonadherence, vomiting [abrupt inability to absorb oral dosage forms]) (Ref)",1704968549,khcee5j,t3_193tbik,t3_193tbik,4,False,t5_4aoxhu
