Complete_Still7584,"I strongly disagree. First, is NMDA antagonists definitely don't potentiate stimulants. Try taking Adderall with agmatine and without it. You'll find agmatine actually does the exact opposite and blunts some of the effects of the Adderall. Second, They reverse tolerance. I've used ketamine to get off Kratom, Suboxone, Phenibut, and Amphetamine (Vyvanse).

aenkmtnam,"Ok. I don't use powerful stimulant like adderall, I use modafinil, but I use tianeptine sodium which is prescribed to me (12.5 mg x 3). The day after 3g of Alcar, I could feel tianeptine sodium mood-boosting effects more than without it. 

Nmda antagonists, even weaker ones like magnesium threonate give me slight dissociation and fatigue the following days. Don't let me begin with agmatine and memantine. 

Taking Alcar every single day loses its benefits, and I start experiencing hypothyroid-like symptoms (swollen eyelids, physical weakness, fatigue, caffeine lasting 1 hour instead of 5 hours, modafinil not working, etc.). 

Alcar is strange because it made me lose weight regardless if I experienced these symptoms or not, and I am a bit underweight.

Now, about alcar crash. 500mg of alcar feels like it lasts 4 hours max, then there is a very noticeable crash, mainly weakness and slight headache. If I dose 3 grams in the morning, the effects last the whole day and I crash at the perfect time just before bed. The next day caffeine, modafinil, and tianeptine seem a bit stronger. 

If I start taking alcar without carbs I begin to experience hypoglycemia and start feeling jittery and weak 

I am planning to drop tianeptine after being 8 months on it, while it helps depression and anxiety, it makes me fatigued and worsens my ADHD. It also overpowers modafinil",1706917253,konxfq7,t3_1aeyos8,t1_ko7wsyy,1,False,t5_4aoxhu

Complete_Still7584,"I can definitely give my offer my opinion. I don't think your protocol is going to work out the way you are hoping it to. I've tried getting off multiple substances with multiple types of nmda antagonists and can confirm that Memantine isn't a strong enough NMDA antagonist to accomplish what you're trying to. I would say even Ketamine wouldn't accomplish the result you're trying to receive. Even if you combined the two. Phenibut SIGNIFICANTLY down-regulates your gaba receptors. I've had trouble with it too. Not only does it down-regulate the gaba b receptor; but, something that most people aren't aware of is that it also minorally down-regulates the gaba a receptor too. A 2-3 week binge is too long. I would even say a 1 week binge would be a little challenging due to the rebound anxiety it will bring. It has such a long mode of action. I would personally only use it 2-4x a week at the most. But, only 4x a week if using ketamine, fasoracetam, and cortexin to mitigate tolerance, increase the rate of upregulation of your gaba b receptor, and help normalize/increase plasticity to help your body be able to adapt to changes; like being on and off a certain substance and slow NMDA activation.",1707337001,kpdq0oe,t3_1aeyos8,t1_koi0tzv,1,False,t5_4aoxhu
