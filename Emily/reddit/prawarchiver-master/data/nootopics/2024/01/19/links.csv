I've been taking magnesium at night to counteract the constipation.

I've been researching Sarcosine and NAC and I think they might benefit me. NAC for the mood lift and possible energy and mood stabilizer, and the NAC for my anxiety.

I just wanted to see what you guys thought about this, what dose should I start with, and do you have any advice on other supplements?

Thank you!
