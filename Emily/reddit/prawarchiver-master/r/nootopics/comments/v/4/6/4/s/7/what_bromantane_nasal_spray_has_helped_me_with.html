        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yo, I started using intranasal bromantane nasal spray a little over a month ago.</p>

<p>I started spraying once in each nostril, every morning for a week. Upped the dose to 3 total sprays each morning. Now I&#39;m back to 2 sprays after a month of using 3 total sprays and I plan on keeping it that way unless I feel I really need an extra spray.</p>

<p>Bromantane nasal spray gave me a huge push to at least be able to function on every day manual tasks that would otherwise be a chore. Simple things such as getting up and taking care of myself, washing dishes, taking out trash, exercising.</p>

<p>It helped me do these things consistently without much hesitation or second thoughts. As opposed to before starting bromantane nasal spray, these simple tasks would be a chore and I would never be consistent.</p>

<p>Bromantane nasal spray has also helped my physical endurance, I haven&#39;t lifted weights for many months, neither do I now. I&#39;m attributing this noticeable increase in physical endurance to my cardio exercises on the treadmill and my endurance while biking.</p>

<p>So to recap, Bromantane nasal spray has helped push me to get manual work done. It has also helped my physical endurance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve been using it for around the same length of time. </p>

<p>I got it just to use in my rotation of Modafinil, Phenylpiracetam, Aniracetam, since they all work better only used a couple times a week.</p>

<p>I quickly started using it everyday in conjunction with those three and it has been amazing. On Modafinil days I only do two sprays. It levels the experience out and makes the comedown easier. It is just amazing with Phenylpiracetam and Aniracetam. I donâ€™t find the need to redose either later in the day like I usually would because of some brain fog. </p>

<p>I do lift weights in a somewhat serious way. I have a trainer and program my diet is dialed in. It hasnâ€™t really helped me out on muscle which wouldâ€™ve been a major upside since Iâ€™ve become a slow gainer as Iâ€™ve aged and I just am not ready for TRT. </p>

<p>It does help my endurance quite a bit though. Iâ€™m rarely fatigued and have had to end my gym sessions before Iâ€™d like to make sure I donâ€™t over train. </p>

<p>Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™m a lot less bothered by the trivial bullshit of life. Stuff like a girl not texting back or getting cut off in traffic or annoying coworkers bother me a whoooooole lot less than they used to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By itself I donâ€™t notice a whole lot of anything. It may give me sliiigghhttllyy more willpower, but definitely not enough to go out and seize the day or anything. Combined with ALCAR I notice more verbal fluency and a slight increase in drive/energy. Combining with l-tyrosine I havenâ€™t noticed any improved benefits from baseline effects I get from bromantane, but when mixing with other dopaminergics it does seem to potentiate it more compared to without it.</p>

<p>My personal favorite combo and where I really noticed bromantane shine the most was combining it with phenylpiracetam, alcar, and l-tyrosine. It was like the smoothest, most functional and natural stimulant feeling Iâ€™ve ever had in my life.</p>

<p>Plus Iâ€™ve noticed bromantane slows the rate at which the stimulant effects of PP build tolerance as it notoriously does very quickly. When taking PP daily alongside bromantane I noticed pretty powerful stimulant effects for around a week and a half before it started to dwindle as opposed to the usual ~3 days by itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve found if I take like one or two days off of PP it completely resets my tolerance and Iâ€™m good for another week or two. Without the Bromantane it was like 3-4 days of effectiveness and the same length of time off to reset</p>

<p>No need to rain on someone&#39;s parade. Not everyone reacts in the same way to things.</p>

<p>Edit: Just realized he&#39;s in the middle of quitting phenibut after high dose. That&#39;s probably causing it.</p>
