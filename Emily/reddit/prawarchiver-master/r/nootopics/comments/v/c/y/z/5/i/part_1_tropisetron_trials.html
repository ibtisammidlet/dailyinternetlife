        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Howdy!  </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about running a placebo double-blind test regarding tropisetron&#39;s effects on cognition and anxiety. Unfortunately, I failed to realize that habituation to the tests is a real problem as someone who has never done dual n-back or any other testing. Thus, I am throwing out those results as invalid and will do those at a later date. However, I would be remised if I did not detail my experiences with this novel substance.</p>

<p>For reference, my current stack is modafinil (100mg/prescribed), buspirone (10mg x2), lutein (20mg), magnesium (240mg?), and ALCAR (500mg). I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, depression, and PTSD. My experience is not one of a typical nootropic user, and it should be not taken as such.</p>

<p>My baseline was a typical day; I got my stuff done, I was fairly dreary but that could be the result of seeing my ex at work. What might be the most pointed is that I had zero motivation to do anything academics-related (I am taking biochemistry and physiology over the summer to graduate early).</p>

<p>At a dose of 5mg, there was a light subjective boost in cognition. I felt like things went... smoother. I was more easily able to articulate my thoughts and process emotions that I had lurking. Folks at the lab I work at were able to notice that I was more upbeat and that I was pointing out mistakes that we have done and saved some experiments. It was pleasant. There were no negative side effects to report outside of some jitters that could have been caffeine-induced.</p>

<p>At a dose of 10mg, there was a moderate subjective boost in cognition AND mood. I was doing everything that I possibly could do. I joined several projects and clubs in my community and finished outstanding circumstances. I reconnected with old friends and increased my social behavior. I was pointing out even more observations to my coworkers and was very productive. I had a noticeable decrease in anxiety, that might or might not have been precipitated by getting stuff done.</p>

<p>However, approximately eight hours after taking 10mg doses, I get a wave of heavy nausea. It has never been enough to vomit but it is very unpleasant. I attribute this to time-dependent reduction of 5-HT3 antagonism. I think that if I tried mirtazapine or ondansetron once this nausea hits that this side effect would be reduced. I will test this at a later date.</p>

<p>My future directions go as follows</p>

<ul>
<li>I am taking the tests repeatedly to habituate myself to a baseline. Once this is accomplished, I will start one week of dose-dependent studies on these tests to see if there is an objective cognitive boost.</li>
<li>Once this is accomplished, I will take this compound at the highest dose tolerable to see if there is a long-term anxiety decrease or cognition increase associated with the compound. </li>
<li>After this, I will discontinue for two weeks and test again to see if the impact is sustained.</li>
<li>Finally, I will take tropisetron with agmatine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist amongst a wide variety of other targets, and see if it has an augmentive effect on tropisetron. Agmatine has been noted to be augmentative for several other substances, but none affect the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor like tropisetron.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any more questions regarding my experience, let me know!</p>

<p>P.S. Once I have the tests at baseline, I will show y&#39;all some pretty graphs :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ginger is also a potent OTC 5HT3 antagonist. Used as an antiemetic in cancer patients receiving chemo in fact. You could use that to test your theory. Recall vortioxetine, an SRI + 5HT3 antagonist that oddly has the highest incidence of nausea of any SSRI. As you’ve seen, other emetic effects (such as nAChR agonism, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, etc.) can trump the anti-emetic effect of 5HT3 antagonism. This could indeed be due to a lower affinity for 5HT3 over other targets (as is the case of vortioxetine), in which the 5HT3 effects will wear off first, and then unopposed emetic mechanisms could remain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m surprised too to be quite honest. This isn’t my first rodeo with a 5-HT3 antagonist (I was on mirtazapine for half a year), and I never got that side effect. I might end up taking a dose of mirtazapine and seeing how the antiemetic effect tapers off. </p>

<p>It’s weird in that with tropisetron, I don’t just lose an iron stomach; I gain nausea when I previously had none. Everything I have done the last few weeks has been fairly normal, so I wouldn’t expect it to be causing the nausea. I’ll have to investigate further and get back.</p>

<p>But also remember that I’m just one monkey. Everyone gets affected by everything in a different way… especially since this is a highly regarded drug for antiemetic purposes I would take this with a massive grain of salt as a possible nocebo.</p>
