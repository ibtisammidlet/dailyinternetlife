<h1>An Introduction to AMPA Positive Allosteric Modulators</h1>

<p>An AMPA PAM works by increasing the likelihood of information processing neurons, or spiking neurons, to fire electrical signals. This is a cascade set off by glutamate binding, which is a pivotal transaction in times of learning. This enhanced calcium signaling will cause long term potentiation (LTP) which strengthens memory and improves learning.<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305710004077?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>6])</a></p>

<p>However, AMPA PAMs have an interesting characteristic: in non-human primates, the increased connectivity from spiking neurons in cortical association regions then activated the precuneus when it would normally be dormant. This is a significant finding, as it indicates entirely new abilities would be possible when otherwise limited by connectivity.<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305710004077?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>6])</a> Interestingly, the precuneus is crucial for episodic memory and human consciousness, and is normally active in a rested state.<a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/129/3/564/390904"><sup>\</sup>7])</a></p>

<p>AMPA PAMs are split into two groups: low impact and high impact. Low impact AMPA PAMs preferentially block extracellular domains that deactivate the receptor,<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305710004077?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>6])</a> while high impact AMPA PAMs may also enhance agonist binding to AMPA, as a traditional PAM would.</p>

</ul>

<h1>TAK-653</h1>

<p>In essence, TAK-653 is a selective AMPA PAM that does not agonize resting AMPA receptors. This is important, because TAK-653 is not only safer, but it enhances cognition beyond the capacity of AMPA PAMs that act as agonists.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93888-0"><sup>\</sup>8])</a></p>

<p>The result is an improvement to working memory and cognitive flexibility without seizures or other forms of toxicity. This is documented in TAK&#39;s preclinical studies, but also in general with AMPA PAMs. Piracetam for instance, the first nootropic, is an AMPA PAM. TAK-653 has went through two phase 1 clinical trials, where it was found to be safe and without side effects. It is under investigation for treatment resistant depression, after TAK-653 improved depression similarly to ketamine, but without damaging cognition.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130572100188X"><sup>\</sup>9])</a></p>

<p>In addition to the above, TAK-653 is very potent at a low dose and has a favorable half life of 10 hours.</p>

<h1>TAK-653 vs Ampakines (CX-717, CX-1739, etc.)</h1>

<p>There appears to be a passive aggressive feud between RespireRx (formerly Cortex Pharmaceuticals) and Takeda, with Respire popularizing the &quot;impact/ ampakine&quot; theory with AMPA PAMs, and Takeda saying that Respire&#39;s AMPA PAMs failed clinical trials because they weren&#39;t selective enough to the allosteric region. In case you haven&#39;t read the high impact/ low impact argument, they basically state that any AMPA PAMs to enhance binding are bad, and that their ampakines are better because they only prolong AMPA currents and don&#39;t influence binding. My take is that they both have a point, but I side with Takeda for a few key reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The only promising CX candidate, CX1739, is so expensive to produce that it would cost your rent just to get the slightest effect. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s better, it just means it&#39;s completely unrealistic.</li>
<li>None of Respire&#39;s ampakines have been clinically successful, and CX717 failed phase 2 clinical trials. This was Respire&#39;s flagship ampakine, and I can&#39;t blame the investors for pulling out after that. They put a ton of hype behind the impact concept, only for its effects to basically <em>scale with how little they amplify currents...</em> Which was their main selling point. It sounds cool in theory, to prolong currents without amplifying them, but there is no proof of concept, and it&#39;s possible this even comes as a disadvantage.</li>
<li>TAK-653 potentiates currents in valuable regions, such as the prefrontal cortex during crucial moments of learning. Due to having low intrinsic agonist activity, it evades aberrant synaptogenesis that would be prone to side effects. Takeda demonstrates TAK-653&#39;s superiority over less selective agonists by directly comparing it to LY451646, finding only enhanced therapeutic potential, benefits to cognition and safety in TAK-653. If CX717 and LY451646 are as comparable as agonists as Takeda suggests,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130572100188X"><sup>\</sup>9])</a> then Respire&#39;s interpretation of AMPA PAMs may have been flawed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The legacy of RespireRx is depressing, and while I wish them a fast recovery, I can&#39;t help but feel their rigidness has come at a great cost. And while I can respect them wanting to pioneer a new concept, they probably should have taken a more traditional approach, like how Takeda worked on improving selectivity and pharmacokinetics.</p>

<p>All in all, TAK-653 seems like a great candidate for a powerful nootropic, with a mechanism of action that easily translates to nootropic effects in healthy people.</p>

<p>One question that comes to mind is, would you expect piracetam to have a synergistic effect on TAK-653? And further, would you expect NMDA antagonists (memantine, agmatine) to block effects of TAK-653? </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Piracetam would synergize with TAK-653 unless you were trying to lower the dose of one or the other. Both are AMPA PAMs. TAK-653 aims to do what Piracetam does but far better. Aside from the cholinergic effects, which I think Tropisetron + TAK-653 would replace, not because Tropisetron increases acetylcholine, but because Tropisetron is a partial agonist of a7 nicotinic receptors which are known to meaningfully increase cognition in healthy people as well as be some of the most important overall in terms of benefits.</p>

<p>TAK-653 will potentiate the good effects of NMDA antagonists as well as prevent cognitive dysfunction to an extent.</p>

<p>I think TAK-653 + Tropisetron + Neboglamine and then maybe Magtein will be the best attempt to increase IQ in a healthy individual. Neboglamine I&#39;m still in the process of making possible, but it grows more and more realistic by the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not your average vendor, my guy. I have connections and an understanding of pharmacology that others do not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a relatively new substance and it&#39;s not even listed on Wikipedia. I&#39;m sure if the CX class compounds were cheaper to synthesize the market would be flooded with them. That&#39;s because those Respire guys did a ton of marketing. Takeda didn&#39;t at all. I only stumbled across the compound after my friend showed me it.</p>

<p>So I gathered up some investors and did a custom synthesis with a lab.</p>
