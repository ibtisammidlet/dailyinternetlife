<blockquote>
<p>Synergic action of L-acetylcarnitine and L-methylfolate in Mouse Models of Stress-Related Disorders and Human iPSC-Derived Dopaminergic Neurons</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TL:DR:</strong> Acetyl-L-Carnitine [ALCAR]&#39;s antidepressant potential might be limited in humans due to its poor oral bioavailability. This study found that a low dose of ALCAR, otherwise ineffective as an antidepressant, is significantly potentiated by the addition of L-Methylfolate (5-MTHF), the active form of Folate (Vitamin B9). L-Methylfolate also potentiated the epigenetic effects of ALCAR and the increase in BDNF levels. The combination of them <em>in vitro</em> promoted dopamine neuron plasticity, which is also seen with the rapid antidepressant Ketamine.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Acetyl-L-Carnitine [ALCAR] is an effective antidepressant in mice, but has inconsistent effects in humans. One reason might be the low oral bioavailability of ALCAR in humans, in contrast to ALCAR being injected in high doses to mice.</p>

<p>In this study, the researchers found a lower dose of ALCAR (30 mg/kg) was ineffective as an antidepressant, as opposed to the usual dose of ALCAR (100 mg/kg). It was found that L-Methylfolate, the active form of Folate (Vitamin B9), greatly potentiates the antidepressant effects of ALCAR, making 30 mg/kg work as well as 100 mg/kg.</p>

<p>The main mechanism of ALCAR&#39;s antidepressant effect is thought to stem from its epigenetic upregulation of the mGlu2/3 glutamate receptor, which acts as an autoreceptor to <em>decrease</em> glutamate levels in the synapse - which tends to reverse depression-like behavior<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607061/">[1]</a></sup> . ALCAR behaves like an HDAC inhibitor, donating its acetyl group to the mGlu2/3 protein to induce a long-lasting upregulation of it - which lasts at least 37 days after the last dose<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407675/">[2]</a></sup> .</p>

<p>The low, ineffective dose of ALCAR in this study was unable to upregulate mGlu2/3 by itself, but in combination with L-Methylfolate, it did upregulate it. L-Methylfolate increased the levels of NF-κB, a protein that is required for the upregulation of glutamate receptors induced by ALCAR, thus synergistically inducing epigenetic effects with ALCAR.</p>

<p>The synergistic antidepressant effect was accompanied by increased BDNF levels in the treated mice. When this combination was tested on dopamine neurons <em>in vitro</em> (not in living mice), it was found the combination of ALCAR and L-Methylfolate promotes dopamine neuron plasticity, increasing growth of their dendrites. This was also observed in other studies with Ketamine, a rapid-acting antidepressant<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29158584/">[3]</a></sup> - and could possibly translate, in vivo, to an increase in dopaminergic signaling, potentially reversing anhedonia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, my apologies for my late reply.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.cerebrolysin.com/fileadmin/redakteur/Cerebrolysin/PDF/Cerebrolysin/CERE_MoA-Folder_CEREINT032018-5.pdf">Cerebrolysin</a> (also called &#39;the king of nootropics&#39;) takes the crown when it comes to increasing nerve growth factors. It is clinically proven to significantly heal nerve damage after substance abuse/trauma/etc., but it&#39;s a great nootropic overall as well for improving cognition. Its use is often paired with (the less-studied) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29798983/">Semax</a>, since they work synergistically. The main downside for most people is the IM or SubQ administration.</p>

<p>Other peptides, like ARA-290, BPC-157, TB4, IGF-1 have shown great improvements as well, but most of the data on their &#39;NGF-increasing properties&#39; are purely anecdotal. For more in-depth info, have a look at r/Peptides.</p>

<p>r/Microdosing psychoactive substances like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34565579/">Psilocybin, Ketamine, DMT</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33860175/">LSD</a> have been shown to increase neuroplasticity too.</p>

<p>Also, extracts of a fruit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/5gzvnr/ziziphus_jujuba_stimulated_the_expressions_of_ngf/">Ziziphus Jujuba</a> has shown very promising results in several studies, along with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/gahqk3/invitro_effects_of_various_flavonoids_on_ngf_gdnf/">other flavonoids</a>. Sadly, there&#39;s a lack of human data on these interesting extracts, as most studies linked are in vitro or in vivo. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33246107/">Lion&#39;s Mane</a> is worth mentioning as well, but as for most of these oral supplements; they all get outperformed by the compounds/peptides I&#39;ve mentioned above.</p>

<p>It&#39;s needless to say that before even considering taking any of these compounds, it&#39;s essential to do your own research and discuss with a professional first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot for such detailed and complete answer - I&#39;m taking a look into Cerebrolysin, seems like a super interesting nootropic. As a side note, I wonder what was your path to gain such deep knowledge about this topics, is your degree / career anyhow related to pharma? As a person whose career is far from the bio / chem world (but quite curious), do you have any recommendations for acquiring some decent intuition / basic kwnoledge that would allow me to understand the mechanisms of action of this drugs?

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I&#39;m by no means an expert in this field; my knowledge is very surface-level compared to actual experts. It&#39;s only recently that I&#39;ve been digging into <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/synaptology">synaptology</a> and how some compounds influence several synaptic responses.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I &#39;accidentally&#39; stumbled upon subreddits regarding this field of expertise after searching for remedies for my hairloss and ADD symptoms at the time. The molecular science/research behind the relevant compounds gained my attention, and I&#39;ve been very involved in it since.</p>

<p>As a result of this sudden obsession, I&#39;ll be following a one-year pharmacist course next month. Since I&#39;m still getting my ADD under control, I will be attending med-school (neurochemistry) next year. Thanks for showing interest!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure! What drugs are you referring to? Nootropics I&#39;m guessing? - Because there are many different branches of pharmacology. Let me know if you&#39;re interested in sources for endocrinology/dermatology/trichology/cardiology/dietology as well.</p>

<p>The things that have helped me get more knowledgeable on the MoA&#39;s of nootropics are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, learn how a synaps works and what effects certain neurotransmitters have on different kinds of receptors. This info is widely available </li>
<li>Looking up studies of the desired compounds on <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> and look for words like &#39;agonist&#39;, &#39;antagonist&#39;, &#39;ligand&#39;, &#39;receptor&#39; with the Ctrl+F mode (mostly found in the discussion/conclusion of the study)</li>
<li>Images like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mechanism-of-action-of-clinically-approved-anti-seizure-drugs-Updated-and-modified-from_fig5_309229655">this</a>. These have helped me immensely. Visualization helps a lot with understanding. You can look for them on Google Images by adding &#39;mechanism of action&#39; behind the compound. Sadly, not all noots have a clear visualization image</li>
<li>Looking through Reddit for threads with knowledgeable people in it, on subs like r/Nootropics, r/NootropicsDepot, r/Nootopics, r/StackAdvice, r/Supplements. It&#39;s worth reading scientific breakdown posts/comments from u/sirsadalot and u/MisterYouAreSoDumb as well</li>
<li>In the case of medical terminology, it&#39;s mostly just through experience. Start with the less-medically written studies, and go up in difficulty as you learn on the way. Just Googling terms helps alot</li>
</ul>

<p>As for nootropics &#39;influencers&#39;, I haven&#39;t come across anyone on social media that has wide up-to-date knowledge about nootropics on a cellular level. The closest to an influencer you&#39;ll get that&#39;s very knowledgeable and has a lot of experience in the field is <a href="https://nootropicsexpert.com/about/">David Tomen from NootropicsExpert</a>. <a href="https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/cerebrolysin">Leo and Longevity</a> is experienced with nootropics as well, but mainly focuses on general health and genetics. </p>

<p>Hope this helps a bit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s hard to say, since the exact mechanisms of NGF and BDNF are still not fully known. </p>

<p>From what I know, <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/ngf/">NGF</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763060/">IGF-1</a> are more important in neuron proliferation and development (mostly in the soma of the neuron), while <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/bdnf/">BDNF</a> also regulates &#39;synaptic plasticity&#39; on top of that (mostly in the axons and dendrites of the neuron). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32897420/">GDNF</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliary_neurotrophic_factor">CTNF</a> are necessary for the maintenance and development of intercellular neural connections.</p>

<p>So to answer your question; mostly IGF-1 and NGF (but BDNF as well) are responsible for creating new neurons, and BDNF, GDNF and CTNF &#39;encourage&#39; connections.</p>

<p>That said, you can look up which compounds are more effective at increasing IGF-1/NGF/BDNF/GDNF/CTNF according to your preferences (although most of the compounds I&#39;ve mentioned increase almost all of them). Unfortunately, the effects of each of these compounds on the human-serum neural growth factors I&#39;ve mentioned, haven&#39;t all been measured/studied (yet). Most studies are only on NGF and/or BDNF. </p>

<p>Anyway, Cerebrolysin stays the most effective for increasing both the things you&#39;ve asked. For only &#39;creating&#39; new neurons, I&#39;d go with IGF-1 analogues. For only &#39;encouraging&#39; neural connections, I&#39;d go with microdosing (and occasionally macrodosing) psychedelics. Theoretically speaking, because I don&#39;t see any logical reasoning behind choosing only one of the two effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I&#39;ve never heard of cycloprolylglycine before, but the info/research on it seems very promising; planning on encapsulating my Noopept. Do you know what dosage of oral Noopept is required for memory improvement? I&#39;m eager to try it out.</p>

<p>A few questions if you don&#39;t mind:</p>

<p>-Is it more efficacious than Cerebrolysin at increasing growth factors (at a safe dosage)? Its lack of human research isn&#39;t helping much. Has someone ever compared the two anecdotally?</p>

<p>-In what study did cPG increase IGF-1 cerebrally? I&#39;ve read about <a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/157/8/3130/2422389?login=false">its IGF-1 regulation and it increasing/decreasing IGF-1&#39;s bioavailability</a> This regulation varies per tissue, as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcp.25782">cPG lowers IGF-1 in mammary glands</a> (in mice). Haven&#39;t found any info on cPG influence on IGF-1 in the brain.</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29921371/">cGP/IGF-1 ratio determines IGF-1 bioactivity in vitro and in vivo.</a>&quot;. What would this mean for endogenous IGF-1 levels if you&#39;re supplementing with supra physiological dosages of cGP? Would be interesting to know if an imbalanced ratio could cause complications, because maybe it&#39;s possible for me to correct the ratio with cGP, as my IGF-1 levels are currently heightened as a result of Ibutamoren administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So bad I posted a wall of texts with references.... and it dissapeared.... so bad. Basically Noopept is the prodrug of cycloprolylglycine (cPG), both have different nootropics effects. Noopept is short acting but increases all memory formation stages, cPG is long lived, it is an endogenous peptide that is a metabolite of IGF-1. cPF increased BDNF, NGF, regulates Insuling sensitivity and IGF-1 senstivity. Best way I think is to take low doses noopept sublingual like 1 - 2 mg and oral 5 - 10 mg noopept doses x 3 a day to increase cPG activity.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been taking 5mg (encapsulated) Noopept 2x a day, 3x a week, for the last two weeks, but the noticeable cognitive effects (aside from the desired cPF effects ofc) were non-existent compared to sublingual Noopept. Makes me wonder if the cPF benefits outweigh the &#39;wasted&#39; Noopept I could&#39;ve used sublingually. </p>

<p>Very interesting molecule for sure, but a lack of human data makes me lean more towards Cerebrolysin+Semax. Maybe my dosing just was too low/off. Have you experimented with it yourself?</p>

It is hypothesized that L-CPG could be a bioactive metabolite of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) produced from its precursor glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), the N-terminal tripeptide of IGF-1 [11].The pharmacological studies showed that L-CPGin doses of 0.05-1.00 mg/kg produces nootropic [5],anxiolytic [4], antihypoxic [6], and neuroprotective[8,12] effects. The neuroprotective activity of thiscyclodipeptide was demonstrated in vitro on variousmodels of neurodegeneration [7]. L-CPG is a positivemodulator of glutamate AMPA receptors [2], which el-evates BDNF in neuronal cell culture [3]. Presumably,this property underlies the mechanism of neurotropicaction of L-CPG. Importantly, L-CPG maintains and/or reset the balance between free and bound forms of IGF-1 by affecting interaction between IGF-1 andIGF-1 binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) [10]. It was con-cluded that L-CPG normalizes the function of IGF-1:in case of deficiency of this growth factor, the dipeptide potentiates its activity; in the opposite case, it inhibits the functional performance of IGF-1. In rat model of acute hypoxia—ischemia, single injection of L-CPG restored the density of capillaries (angiogenic ones included) in the hippocampus and striatum. It was assumed that under conditions of reduced IGF-1 level caused by cerebral injury, the protective function of L-CPG consists in the maintenance of IGF-1-induced vascular remodeling. The same study showed that L-CPG did not bind with tyrosine kinase receptor of IGF-1, although some experimental data indicated the possibility of interaction between L-CPG and IGFBP-3 [10]. Remembering the potency of L-CPG to elevate BDNF and up-regulate the IGF-1-controlled pathway and MAP/ERK signaling cascade, is seems logical to examine whether this dipeptide has the proliferative activity.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pinealon is one of the many peptides found in Cerebrolysin.
It’s thought to be the one peptide responsible for most of Cerebrolysin’s beneficial effects.
However, people who have tried both of them report effects that differentiate significantly from each other;
Pinealon is slightly stimulating, having more of an acute antidepressant &amp; cognitively enhancing effect, whereas Cerebrolysin’s effects come in a ‘cycle’ (first week(s) brainfog &amp; tiredness, with anti-depressant and cognitively enhancing effects later on).
I haven’t tried Cerebrolysin myself (yet), so I can’t share any personal experiences on it. Pinealon has been great so far</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its proposed effects got a bit overhyped for sure. 
I personally find the effects it exerts easily noticable, but still subtle. A nice addition to my stack, but not sufficient enough as a stand-alone compound.</p>

<p>Makes me think and be more ‘in the moment’, rather than viewing things from a larger picture, thus making me less worrisome. At 2-3mgs this is.
I tried 10mgs once and it felt borderline psychedelic; great experience, but not sustainable.</p>

<p>Methylfolate is like adrenaline juice. I’ve noticed things that fuck with COMT like SAM-e, green tea, and methylfolate increase the rate at which I can “accelerate intensity.” That’s how I subjectively feel about it. Alcar is like NZT- limitless movie drug. Together you’re gonna get jolted into a new paradigm through which it is easy to establish a new healthy lifestyle</p>
