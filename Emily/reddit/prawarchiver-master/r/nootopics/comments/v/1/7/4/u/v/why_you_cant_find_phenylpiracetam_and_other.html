<p>The silent phasing out of racetams in the U.S. market has been apparent for years now, but has ramped up recently. Phenylpiracetam has been effectively wiped from the clear net, and other racetams are quickly going out of stock. This is occurring despite their legality in the United States being unchanged. To understand why this is happening, and how people are still acquiring racetams legally on the clear net, we need to consider a variety of recent changes in the racetam supply chain.</p>

<h2>Racetam Legality</h2>

<p>Racetams have always been a legal grey area in the United States. However, unlike more problematic &#39;grey area’ substances like SARMs, SERMs, and other physically enhancing “research chemicals”, the personal use of racetams has been of low priority to the FDA.</p>

<p>Racetams are classified as research chemicals and have been legal to purchase online in the United States for decades. No American pharmaceutical company has attempted to use racetams in their products (aside from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=levetiracetam&amp;sourceid=chrome">levetiracetam</a>), so its evaluation by the FDA has never been funded directly. The FDA has allowed the sale of racetams provided they are not advertised as safe or effective for the treatment of medical conditions.</p>

<p>As far as can be seen on the FDA website, there have been no recent changes to piracetam’s (and other racetams) classification as <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/94164/download">“Category 3: Bulk Drug Substances NominatedWithout Adequate Support”</a>, which allows piracetam and other racetams to be sold online.</p>

<h2>Causes of Racetam Shortage</h2>

<p>So, why are racetams drying up on the clear web despite no recent changes in their legality? Well, the reasons for this are both domestic &amp; international and have developed over the past few years.</p>

<p><strong>Warning Letters</strong></p>

<p>The FDA began sending ‘warning letters’ to racetam vendors in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/97359/download">2018</a>, following a series of crackdowns on the sale of supplements claiming to treat medical conditions. Pure Nootropics, a well-known racetam vendor, was amongst the vendors who were mailed warnings. This event indicates that the FDA was made aware of the growing popularity of racetams which was occurring around this time since traffic volume was one of the metrics mentioned in the FDA transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Customs seizures</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/search/?q=piracetam%20customs&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=">Users began reporting seizures of piracetam</a> and other racetams by their country’s customs around 2018 as well. Piracetam was not on the prohibited substances list of most of these users’ countries.</p>

<p><strong>Alibaba crackdown and foreign labs</strong></p>

<p>The Chinese government issued a <a href="https://sarmguide.com/sarms-ban/">blanket ban on a variety of unscheduled substances</a> in 2021. While most of the substances banned were legitimately high risk and/or illegal, such as SARMs, Cardarine, Modafinil analogs, etc, others were also caught in the ban. Phenylpiracetam was the only racetam to be explicitly banned in the Alibaba crackdown, but vendors soon started withdrawing other racetams from the site.</p>

<p>Many racetam vendors do not synthesize their products in-house, but rather buy in bulk from foreign laboratories on sites like Alibaba. This sudden stoppage in production marked the beginning of the end for racetam availability.</p>

<p>Few vendors have spoken publicly about the foreign lab shortage, possibly as to not reveal to their customers that they are reselling bulk piracetam. Racetam supply began to dwindle from this point onwards up until today, in mid-2022, where most racetams are simply unavailable on the clear web.</p>

<h2>Future of Racetams</h2>

<p>The future of racetams is uncertain. The sudden racetam shortage of 2022 did not occur due to FDA crackdowns or any change in the legal status of racetams. It is clear that although the FDA has placed limitations on the sale of racetams in the past, the FDA does not plan to pursue any further action provided that they are not advertised as cures for any medical condition. It is uncertain if China will amend its 2021 blanket ban, and if foreign labs will begin relisting racetams any time soon.</p>

<p>Domestic production of piracetam may already be in silent development amongst racetam vendors. Sounding the alarm and alerting your competition of a market vacuum is not in the interest of said vendors, so users will likely be kept in the dark until these labs are up and running.</p>

<h2>Where to get Racetams?</h2>

<pre><code>NOTE: Racetams are legal to purchase and possess in the United States, but only for research use. Be sure to check the legality of racetams in your country. 
</code></pre>

<p>Most racetams are unavailable on the surface web. Conventional reselling services such as eBay do not allow racetams to be sold, so any resale is likely between users. This type of exchange can be dangerous and is not recommended. Some nootropics stacks that are still in stock may contain racetams. Moderated user-to-user resale groups may begin to pop up within the next few months, and will likely be the safest method of acquiring racetams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man... I just recently started running out of the oxiracetam I bought years ago. Oxiracetam was always my favorite racetam to use for stacking. I came back to the scene and was like, &quot;wtf happened?&quot; It&#39;s sad to see how every racetam has been phased out... Heck even a few months ago when I peaked, there was still some aniracetam floating around with these vendors... Not anymore! lol Thanks for the explanation though! I felt so in the dark. haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im quite sad at the racetam sweep thats happening. i have a bunch of oxi/ani left but thats it. its disgusting how authorities just take shit away from us like that, shit that does wonders for our quality of life in general. why do they like to take away the things we love the most? meanwhile, killers like alcohol and tobacco run rampant, making us dumber and giving us cancer. but some cool interesting compounds that do the opposite of make us dumber with no carcinogenic properties? i guess anything that doesnt keep us dumb and dying is not ok to them... so many things wrong with so many things :(</p>
