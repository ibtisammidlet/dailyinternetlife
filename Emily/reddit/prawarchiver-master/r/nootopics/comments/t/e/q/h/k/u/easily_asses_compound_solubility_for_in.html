<p><strong>IN administration method isn&#39;t anything new</strong>, what is special about this in my opinion is the fact that caprylic acid seems to be a great IN carrier for fat soluble nootropics. He has popularized the usage of bromantane with caprylic acid and I would just like to add a few things on top of that and further improve on this and further our self experimentation!</p>

<p><strong>Bromantane is easily fat soluble</strong> which makes it easily <strong>solvable in caprylic acid</strong>. I am not sure how he determined this, but I want to give you an <strong>easy method of figuring out wether a nootropic is Fat or Water soluble</strong>. If it is fat soluble you can use it in caprylic acid as a carrier if it is more water soluble I recommend a saline solution which often is used as a nasal decongestion agent in medical settings.</p>

<p>(I am aware that some of you already know this, just want to spread the word)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>If you want to skip doing it yourself, I have done a post with a list of a few popular noots and their values:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/teujiu/fatwater_solvability_for_in_administration_of/">Fat/Water solvability for IN administration of Nootropics!</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Traditional Method:</strong></p>

<p>The traditional way of figuring out wether a compound is water soluble is by figuring out wether the molecule can make hydrogen bonds (in german we call it Wasserstoffbr√ºcken, so not sure if this english term is accurate) and/or if it is polar. If one of these two is the case it most likely is water soluble. If it isn&#39;t it often times is fat soluble. This is basic chemistry that I learnt in highschool so don&#39;t hate. Hydrogen bonding generally can be made by a molecule if it a hydrogen is paired with either the elements F, N or O. So if you have -FH, -NH or -OH in your molecule it can make hydrogen bonds and thereby is likely water soluble. Now the second factor that can also make a molecule water soluble is wether it is polar or not. If a molecule is polar it is water soluble since it aligns very well with the water molecule (which is also a polar molecule). Check this video to figure out wether a molecule is polar: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CQe-_PJU4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CQe-_PJU4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Easy Method:</strong></p>

<p>Now I cam across a few issues when doing this mostly it was just a huge pain calculating electronegativity and figuring out all the hydrogen bonds which usually is very time consuming and draining.  So here is the easier method:</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.unil.ch/">University of Lausanne</a> and <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/intas/home.html">INTAS</a> (im not affiliated with them just wanted to give credit where credit is deserved). A software has been developed using AI that is able to pretty accurately predict fat and water solvability without you having to go the traditional way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vcclab.org/lab/alogps/">http://www.vcclab.org/lab/alogps/</a> -&gt; here is the link to the tool. I recommend the <a href="http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/">Non-Java Interface</a> for quick access and results.</p>

<p>Here is a quick guide of what the values mean and how to use the tool.</p>

<p>**1.**So first figure out what nootropic/compound you want to analyze.</p>

<p>**2.**Find it on <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> and scroll to 2.1.4.</p>

<p>**3.**You will get something like: C1C2CC3CC1CC(C2)C3NC4=CC=C(C=C4)Br (Bromantanes smile code)</p>

<p>**4.**Paste the smile code <a href="http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/">http://www.vcclab.org/web/alogps/</a> in the SMILE section.</p>

<p>**5.**The tool will spit out something like:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/6ievibq8sjn81.png?width=804&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaddc815174bb541dc17b27a4c6d09bea41eac0f">Bromantanes Results</a></p>

<p>Now what is important here is mainly whats below <strong>LogP</strong> and <strong>LogS</strong> can also be indicative.</p>

<p>Here is the <strong>rule</strong> everything that is <strong>below 1 for LogP is More water Soluble.</strong> Everything that is <strong>over 1 becomes more Fat soluble.</strong></p>

<p>So as you can see simply based on that Bromantane is very fat soluable. Which is also true if we look at it from the traditional method. Just 1 hydrogen bond (very little in comparison to the whole molecule) and it does not look to be polar (to be fair haven&#39;t calculated it&#39;s respective electronegativity.</p>

<p><strong>LogS</strong> if i understood it correctly is how much is soluble in water. Generally here the rule is the higher the value the more soluble it is in water. Most medications are at around a -4 which is pretty alright. (<strong>Correct if I am wrong on this</strong>)</p>

<p>&quot;In the following diagram you can see that more than 80% of the drugs on the market have a (estimated) logS value greater than -4.&quot; <a href="https://www.organic-chemistry.org/prog/peo/logS.html">Source</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/0rhbng8t3kn81.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85445af0ccef5eb1d8b6f6abb37aecf004115d20">https://preview.redd.it/0rhbng8t3kn81.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85445af0ccef5eb1d8b6f6abb37aecf004115d20</a></p>

<p>And here is a comparison of the Values of something that is very Water soluble:</p>

<p><strong>Salt or NACL</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/izehxss24kn81.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56d65c4ab6e7160f15014c5b5a5e9aca5899ce72">LogP Very much below 1 (water soluble) LogS very high</a></p>

<p><strong>I think if a compound has LogP value of around 1 then it might be &quot;okey&quot; soluble in both solvents. Please correct me on this if this statement is wrong. I am aware that we have some chemistry geniuses among us.</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER/PRECAUTIONS!</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind these are <strong>estimates</strong> and will <strong>not be 100% accurate</strong>, but this will help you gauge a compounds solubility without having to try it out. Also if you plan on trying to <strong>administering a compound intraNaselly</strong> do not crush up the medication/noot if it is in pill or capsule form, they <strong>often times have fillers</strong> that may cause irritation and other issues when administered IN. Also keep in mind that <strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> and <strong>Pharmacogenomics will change when changing the MOA</strong>, but generally these rules will mostly (<strong>but not always</strong>) apply. <strong>IN = More local action, Higher bioavailability, Faster onset, shorter half life, less liver toxicity.</strong></p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing your reports of IN administration of Noots. Have wonderful day</p>

<p><strong>ps: This solvability question also helps with boofing :p</strong></p>

<p>Also, I was told I can make nanoemulsions basically with a few chemicals and repurposing ultrasonic toothbrush. But still haven&#39;t tried yet. This could also be a cool addition to improve intranasal bioavailability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff gintrux! I have trialed menthol myself and it seems to have good results anecdotally. Have you tried 1% dipotassium glycyrrhizinate or chitosan? Any other benefit to using them?</p>

<p>Menthol also has acute stimulating and strong decongesting effects which can also potentially enhance absorption. Which is also personally why I like it.</p>
