        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>New discord link:  <a href="https://discord.gg/B4QA7nqZRS">https://discord.gg/B4QA7nqZRS</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>So as many of you know, our server has been snubbed yet again. But this time they actually took down NooTopics. So there&#39;s no denying discord&#39;s stance at this point. They do not like our community and what we&#39;ve been doing.</p>

<p>There is hope, however. We are going to try and &quot;bridge&quot; matrix to discord so that we can intercommunicate between the two platforms. Discord is more user friendly and matrix will last longer. We need something to fall back on <em>and</em> we need something that feels natural.</p>

<p>And as always, we always have r/NooTopics. But reddit isn&#39;t a whole lot better than discord. So if you&#39;re like me and you want this to keep going, then please be open to alternative media. We are only going to be more discriminated against as time goes on.</p>

<p><strong>Other news:</strong></p>

<p>u/gintrux uses rocket chat for r/NootropicsFrontline, but we have opted to go a different route due to a need for a voice chat. At times NooTopics sustained 14+ members in voice chats.</p>

<p>Speaking of gintrux, I am collaborating with him. My website <a href="https://bromantane.co">https://bromantane.co</a> hosts his Tabernanthalog, which is supposed to function as a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic of sorts, an ibogaine derivative.</p>

<p>In addition, I will receive more bromantane on monday which I am going to have tested and I should be back in stock soon. Pre-orders are enabled until then. SKQ1 will also be added to the site, a mitochondrial antioxidant. I also hope to collaborate with Bam and his website Wholistic Research, as well as all other upstanding vendors, who has novel nootropics and conducts adequate testing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m having better effects using 25 mg sublingual bromantane from <a href="https://science.bio">science.bio</a> solution, so 18 mg intranasal would be powerful compared to that. So my hypothesis is that I&#39;m not dosing it well,  I think the spray bottle does not fit good enough in my nostril or perhaps I don&#39;t have the enough IQ for trying things like this.</p>
