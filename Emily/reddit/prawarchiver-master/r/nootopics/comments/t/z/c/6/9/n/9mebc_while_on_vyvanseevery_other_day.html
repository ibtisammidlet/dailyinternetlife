        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello! </p>

<p>I started getting interested in nootropics when I noticed HOW much of a difference vyvanse does for me.</p>

<p>I have it for ADD but its the only med that helps with my depression as well!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried everything except strong maoiâ€™s and nothing helped until this!</p>

<p>However I only get like 5 hours of relief from my 70mg/day and I would rather find a more sustainable method than increasing the dosage.</p>

<p>My stack: Semax, uridine, TMG, l-theanine, a-gpc, noopept, aniracetam, forskolin, gym..</p>

<p>Could I add 9-mbc instead of vyvanse every other day? Would that seem like a good idea for my goal?</p>

<p>Thank you have a great weekend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youâ€™d be right. Mixing MAOIs and releasers can turn bad very fast. Generally Iâ€™d recommend 24-48 hours after the half life before taking a releaser just to be sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did the 9-mbc for just one day(will try it for real soon when i take a couple weeks break from meds) but wow..  it added almost 2hrs on the 5hrs my vyvanse is effective for me..</p>

<p>It might be placebo but i dont usually get much placebo effect.. but, we will see how it affects my anhedonia after a 3weeks use later on:-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That great! Perhaps the only mild MAOI effects of 9-me-bc allow the amphetamine to stick around longer than normal but without elevating levels to uncomfortable/dangerous amounts. </p>

<p>Iâ€™d be interested to see how this goes long term if you could make a post down the road. Still be careful though. MAOI effects can build up over time, so after only a few regular doses it may be fine, but after a longer period of time negative effects may come up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course, i will! And these weeks i wont take much else and def no stims. Always been curious if i could get the same antidepressant effects from an mao-b inhibitor as i get from amphetamines.  I Guess not as strong but maybe a more natural happiness less forced. Or maybe none at all xD well see I will start in a week</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is important is how long you have been using them, most anti-depressants don&#39;t start working until multiple months of consistent usage. Also most of the anti-depressants you mentioned are prone to lots of side effects, which among other things my favorite one is vortioxetine or in the US (trintellix), since it barely has any side effects except most commonly neausa. (Which also btw can be easily be circumvented through ginger supplementation). I obviously highly advise against using vyanse. Its at best a very temporary solution. You quickly build tolerance, dependance and often times addiction to it. So it&#39;s not sustainable in the long term. It also most likely also is neurotoxic, so I highly advise you if you want to quite, slowly tytrate down your dosage over time and opt for better alternatives. I recommend like I mentioned using 5mg of vortioxetine (at that dosages most people don&#39;t have any side effects at all!) or go up to 10mg and use something like ginger to manage neuasa (which is most common). Use it regularly and don&#39;t expect an effect until multiple months down the line. As it is hard to wait so long and you will probably be dealing with discontinuation symptoms from vyanse, I recommend talking to your doctor about Intranasal Ketamine for the time being until the vortioxetine starts working sort of to bridge the gap until effects fully kick in. This should work for you and will be much better in the longterm, I hope you will be able to slowly titrate down from vyvanse without having suvere discontinuation symptoms. Like I said using <strong>prescribed</strong> intransaal ketamine will be a good option to get through the time when you are titrating down and are concurrently taking vortioxetine. Hope this helps</p>
