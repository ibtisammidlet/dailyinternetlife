<p>Does anyone know the correct angle I should be spraying it so that I can maximize the amount absorbed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hallo maybe this can help: I stumbled upon a nice shrt video form a doctor on YT that explains how to use nasal sprays . I am following his advise now every time I use any type of nasal spray: DR gregory Abbass: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnEre7FHUAQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnEre7FHUAQ</a>  </p>

<p>he tells  how to position your head, with which hand you should spray, and the direction you should spray towards (ie at which angle in your nostril).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the best way it’s shake it well, have it spray more effective that way. Take a nice big sniff with one nostril closed, same with the other side. and just keep sniffing couple times after. I feel it right away after barely if any comes out very little sometimes. Keep doing this depending how hard you need to sniff each nostril one at a time whenever you use it to not come out. Always sniff a couple times to ensure it doesn’t come out. Just experiment how hard you breath it in and how long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your advise on this! And just so I am clear in my understanding of the process, is this right:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After shaking spray one nostril.</p></li>
<li><p>Then take a big sniff with that nostril with the other nostril closed.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat 1 &amp; 2 on the other nostril.</p></li>
<li><p>Always sniffing a couple of times on each side.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is that right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes correct and for assurance just sniff regular a couple times after with both open, like if your trying to keep mucus from coming out when your sick. Steps 2&amp;3 are the most important tho keep seeing how hard you need to sniff every time you do it and how long like 5 to 6 seconds would be good. And always shake it well before use.</p>

I usually spray it father back than typical nasal sprays that are more of a spray than oil, then let it run down to the front of my nose and keep it clenched for a while.

    <div class="md"><p>The stimulation goes away relatively soon with Bromantane, it does not mean it&#39;s not working. It typically becomes more relaxing, from what I understand. Which has been my experience with it, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do use it every day. The only thing I can think of that would have increased the effectiveness was that at the time I had a cold and my nasal passages were stuffed up in the back so I could spray it as far back as needed and none would go down my throat and a minimal amount came out the front</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s odd. I once did a course of the Russian pharmaceutical pills and there was an almost immediate subjective benefit.  </p>

<p>50-100mg . The pills are dosed a lot higher, I think the sprays have like 7mg for a dose? Has anyone had both? I curious if it crossed the BBB better IN and has more of a regenerative effect on the brain and less of a slight performance enhancing effect on the body.  </p>

<p>I like that it&#39;s very easy on the body and doesn&#39;t dangerously interact with other medications that work on neurotransmitters, At worst they will compete for some of the same receptors, Maybe an irreversable MAO Inhibitor could still be risky, but I haven&#39;t seem it come up in any of the literature I  read back then.</p>

The main thing to remember is - Don&#39;t sniff hard, just gently smell with the other nostril closed.  I keep a cotton ball to catch any drips and then sniff the cotton ball.
BTW: Is it okay to use the liquid Bromantane sublingually? I don&#39;t want to try if it&#39;s not okay to swallow some. Thanks fellow Bro&#39;s!🤗</p>
