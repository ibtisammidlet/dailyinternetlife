I received confirmation email but that’s it. Order placed before noon 2 days ago, which isn’t even long, however most nootropics ship out in this time period.
 Only making a post just because i can’t get ahold of him.</p>

<p>Either way, I have high hopes for the product!</p>

<p>EDIT: Sirsadalot gave me tracking within the next two days and I received it yesterday! 
 100% effective as well</p>

If memory serves me right I ordered on a Sunday and it showed up that Friday. So I wouldn’t be worried just yet.

    <div class="md"><p>I usually take 4 sprays - I space them out about 5 minutes each so they all absorb. I know 2-3 is recommended, but I have very bad ADHD and just felt like a little extra helps. Maybe I’ll try to work down to the 2-3 range eventually.</p>

<p>Honestly, this is the closest thing to a miracle product I’ve ever experienced. Bromantane makes me able to focus. I feel somewhat stimulated, but not in as much of a drug-like feeling as Adderall. It’s not as strong as Adderall, but it replaced all my Adderall doses this week, and I still can get work done. I hope to replace Adderall with Bromantane permanently if the effects continue. I also like that I don’t have issues sleeping on it, getting hungry, or feeling a fast heart rate. It’s really good.</p>

<p>Additionally, I struggle with an addiction I struggle with, and I haven’t had cravings while on Bromantane. Maybe I lucked out with my biology, but this product really helps me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t tried sublingual for bromantane, so I don’t have that as a benchmark to compare it to.</p>

<p>I also haven’t tried modafinil, though I’ve used adrafinil quite a bit. In my experience, adrafinil was good for wakefulness but didn’t do too much to help me focus. I feel that bromantane helps me focus more. It also helps me with wakefulness, but maybe a little less than adrafinil.</p>

<p>My addiction is a sex addiction. I frequently do all day binge sessions of porn and edging. I’ve let these sessions go on even if there’s other tasks I need to be doing. I also frequent strip clubs way more than I should, and I’ve spent a pretty penny on OnlyFans. On my first week using bromantane, I went an entire week without any porn or masturbation. I didn’t even feel compelled to look at porn. For me, this is unheard of. The only sexual activity I had was intercourse a couple of times with a woman. Frankly, I’d like to limit my sexual activity to real women, so this is all a win for me.</p>

I thought bromantane suppose to increase dopamine so how is it helping you with sex addiction? I am going to try it so i can become addicted to things since i don&#39;t have any addictions now so life is more boring.</p>
