    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately not a whole bunch of research has been done on Bromantane so this could also be untrue in humans given that most of the data we do have comes from animals. However it is believed that due to Bromantane&#39;s unique pharmacology tolerance is not built and of course plenty of anecdotes exist supporting the theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great write up, that post was actually what led me to this sub. I don’t understand the discrediting of 9-me-bc, though. It was easily one of the best noots I’ve ever taken, and had long lasting positive effects for months after that I believe only diminished because I got back into the habit of using dopaminergic drugs again with semi-frequency. It’s not meant to be taken long term, just like once or twice in your life over the course of 2-3 weeks daily. Idk.</p>

<p>Don’t want to seem like I’m discrediting your post though, you’re clearly way more educated on neurochemistry than I am, and your write up on bromantane was brilliant. I’m just saying I don’t think 9-me-bc should be brushed under the rug as it so often is, bc it has worked miracles in some people in this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s nothing to credit about it. There is no evidence it has an &quot;after effect&quot;, most likely the opposite is true. And there&#39;s no safety testing, beyond the worrisome results of predictive software analysis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a MAOI, they have a long history of helping people, but it&#39;s nothing special.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But 9 ME BC is not only a MAOi, it regulates several genes related to dopaminergic pathways. It lacks clinical trials, but the substance works and feels very differently compared to MAO inhibitors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>then why does everyone find it more powerful at a dose that inhibits like 5% MAO-A &amp; 1% MAO-B than shit like moclobemide with 40% inhibition at 150mg  </p>

<p>my conclusion here is that it&#39;s worthwhile to look into anti-inflammatory substances like low dose naltrexone to gtfo the usefulness of 9-me-bc. I invite you to research this paradigm even if you think that 9-me-bc doesn&#39;t have anfi-inlammatory effects. I would say it&#39;s better for everyone if people have less reason to ingest it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dopaminergic effects that i experienced the first few days are exactly what stopped. Things like motivation and sharpness/clarity of thinking. Unless those aren&#39;t dompaminergic. This is just odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tolerance has been (probably) real for me.But there is a lot of folks out there that report using the substance for a long time with not tolerance issue. </p>

<p>When I bring up the issue of lowering efficacy of Bromantane I get one or two ppl agreeing with me. There is probably a strong element of bias in these reports,it is possible that if Bromantane, or any substance, stops working for someone they just move on after a time, which I think is skewing the number of ppl actually experiencing a lowering efficacy to appear lower than it actually is. That or the few that seems to be unable to get more than a week of effect from Bromantane are just freaks for some reason we don&#39;t know yet.</p>

<p>I am currently going through 3rd day of cycling it &#39;off&#39; hoping it will regain its effect when I go back on it.</p>
