        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>F-Phenibut is the 4-fluoro (halogenated) deviate of the popular &quot;nootropic&quot;/research chemical Phenibut. It behaves similarly to that of Phenibut with the exception of being roughly around a couple magnitudes more potent of a gaba-b full agonist. This makes it appealing to people who are chasing stronger highs and drugs that require less to achieve more euphoria. F-phenibut not only is an addictive drug with the same addiction liabilities as normal Phenibut but also possesses additionally negative aspects such as inherent Neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>This toxicity is mediated through potassium pumps and potassium channel inhibition causing brain damaging via potassium influx. It may also through a similar mechanism disable or irreversibly damage/deactivate the gaba-b receptor sites that the drug binds to. This may cause irreversible gaba-b receptor damage. </p>

<p>This is unique to Fluorophenibut and doesn&#39;t seem to share with Phenibut in these properties. It is proven to be neurotoxic through the studies provided below. Additionally there have been reports of potential heart damage from fluorophenibut is just further reason to stay as far away as possible from this compound.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post advises people to stay as far away as they can from this compound and help spread awareness of the toxicity of fluorophenibut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through 5-10 grams of this stuff in a year and noticed aftereffects on motor coordination and verbal acuity that exceeded that of either benzos or regular phenibut. F-phenibut had actually felt fairly kind to me mentally (I experienced no addiction or perceptibly lasting aftereffects), but this post is really worrying me. So to clarify, it should be neurotoxic because it destroys GABA-B receptor sites? If so, should an f-phenibut user be more concerned about the destruction of GABA-B sites or the potentially resulting excitotoxicity? Finally, in what ways (if any) could this GABA-B mediated neurotoxicity be ameliorated?</p>

<p>EDIT: Just noticed OP only linked one study, and that study was linked twice but from different publications. The first three links are all based on a single <em>in vitro</em> study; the last link is entirely anecdotal and doesn&#39;t even support your point (the OP came back and posted that his symptoms were most likely due to withdrawal). I&#39;m not saying this post is wrong, but there doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s enough evidence to draw such drastic conclusions. Is there any more proof backing this hypothesis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have been experimenting with f-but/baflofen for nearly 3 years now for quite a couple months of which i have abused it on a regular basis, mixing it with all kinds of other drugs, a lot of which have mediated their effects through similar mechanisms of action as well etc.</p>

<p>even though my dosing didn’t escalate and never exceeded 600mg per dose, i have dosed high multiple times a day daily for over 2 months straight just to gauge the habituation/weaning timeline, tolly buildup and compare to other substances/just to see if what ppl were saying held true. (one of my buddies warned me to be extremely cautious since dude he knew got seizures after using f-but at moderate doses for hardly even 2 weeks)</p>

<p>tolerance buildup was very slow at first compared to other gabapentinoids, and high doses felt much more enjoyable/less negative side fx. (i haven’t used in 300-400mg+ doses in ages though)</p>

<p>i haven’t noticed any mental decline, and had a complete physical checkup a cpl months ago including long term ecg, sall good.</p>

<p>a bunch of times when mixing with fluorobut i couldn’t enjoy the nod at all (besides the notorious gabaB OD twitches) cos i was genuinely scared my hearts gonna jump out of my chest. kratom and zolpidem in particular come to mind, think it’s due to qt interval prolongation or whatever the fuck.</p>

<p>purely from experience i doubt it’s directly cardiotoxic or neurotoxic, at least not particularly much more so than a lot of other drugs, the prospect of insane receptor downregulation/straight up destruction of receptor sites on the other hand is p scary..</p>

<p>&quot; The mechanism of fluorine<br/>

not been fully explained. Defluorination of<br/>
fluorinated drugs can readily occur during<br/>
biotransformation, or may also occur spontaneously,<br/>

direct reaction with a nucleophilic group present in<br/>
proteins and amino acids, such as the amino group<br/>
in lysine, the sulphydryl group in cysteine or the<br/>
hydroxyl group in serine (Park et al. 2001). Such<br/>
defluorination was observed for example in the case<br/>
of an antimalarial drug 5-fluoro-amodiaquine<br/>
(Harrison et al. 1992) or hormone<br/>
2-fluoroethynilestradiol (Morgan et al. 1992). In rare<br/>
instances, even the trifluoromethyl group may<br/>
undergo defluorination (Thompson et al. 2000)&quot;</p>
