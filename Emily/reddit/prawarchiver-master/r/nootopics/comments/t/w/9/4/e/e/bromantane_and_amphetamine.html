Any reason to think alternating bromantane usage may have some tolerance, safety, or efficacy benefits? I was thinking maybe through the immediate early gene effect of bromantane. Obviously there could be other mechanisms by which there may be some potential benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been taking sirsad&#39;s bromantane spray (1-2 sprays per nostril) with ~5-6mg Vyvanse 4-6 days a week for about a month now with no adverse effects.  Once a week I also take a second dose of Vyvanse a few hours after the first.</p>

<p>Bromantane was the addition; have been on low-dose amphetamine for a few months prior. First few days on bromantane I had some pretty pleasant body euphoria, but now I don&#39;t notice really notice anything from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dicearx, slightly off the original topic of the post, but I&#39;m just curious how you arrived to that specific dosage of Vyvanse, and how do you go about measuring it? to you crush the pill into a powder and then measure it using the mg scale? </p>

<p>Just for some context, I&#39;m asking you this because doctor wants to start me on vyvanse 30mg (for adhd) , but I&#39;ve never taken amphs regularly before (only &quot;receationally&quot;), and I think even 10mg might even be too much for me at once, because I know I&#39;m very sensitive to stimulants and prone to get hyper/anxious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vyvanse comes in powder form in a capsule. It&#39;s a very inexact science, but I crack the capsule open and fill the smaller half about halfway with powder, then dump that directly on my tongue. The 5-6mg number comes from the fact that I can do this 5-6 times with each of my 30mg pills.</p>

<p>It sounds as if your recreational experience has been with Adderall, which has a much more peaky effect due to, if I remember correctly, the d form of the amphetamine isomer, whereas Vyvanse is just the l isomer. Something like that, but the point is the doses between the two are not equivalent - Vyvanse is definitely a milder come up and down, less euphoria (as a therapy, you probably want to avoid this effect anyway), and lasts longer than Adderall</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for taking as little amphetamine as you can to get by, just know that 10mg Vyvanse might not be as strong as you expect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I <em>also</em> know this is almost a year later (fist bump, <a href="/u/insaneinthecrane">/u/insaneinthecrane</a>!), but I gotta say to you and <a href="/u/annapoh56">/u/annapoh56</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vyvanse is <strong>not</strong> the levorotatory enantiomer. It is, in fact, <strong>purely</strong> d-amphetamine, <em>unlike</em> Adderall, which is 75% d- and 25% l-. </li>
</ul>

<p>The reason it&#39;s &quot;smoother&quot;-feeling is partly:</p>

<ul>
<li>a), because dextroamphetamine is usually a bit nicer like that anyway; it&#39;s the l-amph that tends moreso toward the uncomfortable peripheral stimulation that many associate with jitteriness (although <em>supposedly</em> some people actually get the reverse effect from the enantiomers, feeling more CNS stimulation from l-amph instead... or so the marketers said); </li>
</ul>

<p>...and partly:</p>

<ul>
<li>b), because Vyvanse is actually <em>lis-</em>dexamphetamine: i.e., it has an amino acid (<strong>lys</strong>ine, see?) attached, which your liver enzymes have to cleave away before you can make use of our friend the dexamphetamine molecule — hence causing a slower come-up, steadier release, and longer duration of action.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><em>warning: amphetamine-induced logorrhea in this section</em></p>

<p>If it causes less euphoria — though I&#39;d <em>bet</em> that we&#39;d find people on both sides on this question* — it&#39;s because, even though d-amph tends to be more pleasurable for most, euphoria seems to be unusually dependent on some sort of neural calculation regarding <em>how much and how quickly</em> one&#39;s mental state has changed...</p>

<p>...rather than the (seemingly-more-sensible/sensical) method of looking at something like &quot;total happychemical concentration&quot; or the like. </p>

<p>I.e., for some reason, euphoria and pleasure seem particularly sensitive to &quot;distance between current_state and initial_state&quot; / &quot;change in happy_chemical concentration&quot; <em>within some unit of time</em> — instead of caring more about the total &quot;distance traveled&quot;, or absolute concentration.</p>

<p>Why relative instead of absolute? I don&#39;t <em>think</em> anyone really knows why; but there are some weird complicated theories which I can&#39;t decide whether to judge like Continental philosophy or like Everett&#39;s universal wavefunction.</p>

<p>(...that is to say: stupid... or brilliant and merely <em>apparently</em> stupid?)</p>

<hr/>

<p><em>back to actually relevant stuff</em></p>

<p>*I&#39;d <em>bet</em> that the more experience one has with (ab)using stimulants, the less relatively-euphoric lisdexamphetamine will be. When you&#39;re still real sensitive to it, the superior action of d-amph will dominate; when you need to pop &#39;em like candy, the harder-hitting quality of downing lots of regular mixed-amphetamine-salts (a.k.a.: Adderall or generic) will become more important. </p>

<p>Maybe we could do a poll.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Uh, that&#39;s all I wanted to say, I guess. Also: boy, I sure do love  amphetamine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for your reply,  that&#39;s really helpful to me! May I ask what difference have tou been feeling between taking Vyvanse alone vs. Vyvanse and bromantane together (I mean, Ince your body settled, after the initial few days of euphoria sensation with Bromantane). What was your reasoning for adding the Bromantane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I added bromantane because I was curious after looking over all of sirsad&#39;s research. I knew it could potentiate the amphetamine, but at such low doses, I figured I&#39;d be safe</p>

<p>I actually have pretty much stopped taking it at this point. Don&#39;t think I was getting anything out of it, unfortunately, but won&#39;t know for sure until I&#39;m a few weeks removed from taking it so I can evaluate a before/during/after</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is almost a year later but if you want a MUCH more accurate way to split vyvanse, open the capsule and dump the entire contents in a graduated water bottle. Wait a few minutes, shake it up and then drink the portion you want</p>
