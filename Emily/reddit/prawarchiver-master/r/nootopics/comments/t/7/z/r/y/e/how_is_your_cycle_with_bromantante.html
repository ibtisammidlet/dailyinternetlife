<p>Benefits seem to be a nice sense of calm and motivation. For me it&#39;s primarily about the help for exercise than the nootropic effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be depending on dosage and on individual factors that govern dopamine receptor sensitivity. Its not necessarily a tolerance to the medication itself. </p>

<p>So somebody with low levels of dopamine would likely already have very sensitive receptors, a small increase would not likely cause much down regulation if any at all.</p>

<p>In a case of somebody with high levels of dopamine due to natural production or using other dopaminergics concurrently, then yes they would likely experience more down regulation of the receptor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had good results for a few days that then the effect of bromantane stopped even when tripling the dose. I have asked ppl that said their results have been consistent for months. What do you think could be a reason for this huge variance of results. I have ADHD, so I was surprised to read ur comment about high dopamine producers possibly developing tolerance. Any help info in how this can be fixed would be really üëç</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the effect return if you cycle it?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know being completely honest. It could be a myriad of things. If using bromantane increases L-dopa production then it may be subject to the same issues with tolerance developed to L-dopa. In this situation it is best to cycle the compound on and off. </p>

<p>You could concurrently run 9-me-bc to resensitise dopamine receptors but considering it is a research chemical with no long term data, this would be a potentially hazardous option. There are theories that the compound can be toxic or carcinogenic. I do not consider the toxicity of the compound to be a strong possibility, but I do not know enough about its potential as a carcinogen to refute that theory. </p>

<p>Try cycling it for now, or use a very low dose and use something else concurrently like selegiline. Or use your ADHD diagnosis to use first line stimulants, modafinil or armodafinil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for taking the time.
I did as you suggested and did not take Bromantane for 3 days, after which the effects returned for the most part.
I have always been a bit puzzled on how something that strengthen dopamine signaling like bromantane can have no tolerance as a lot of ppl claim from experience, since even though the mechanism seems different from stimulants, must non the less result in more dopamine signaling at the receptor. So, if that is the case, I wonder if someone is sensitive enough to the substance that the effect of bromantane causes an increase of dopamine sudden enough to cause downregulation of receptors?</p>

<p>I have access to prescription stimulants, and they do OK but I prefer to not rely on it in the long term. It would take a longer post to explain all my thoughts behind that. But in short, I prefer the effects of Bromantane, which also does things for me that Adderall doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.</p>

<p>You should look into other strategies to increase dopamine synthesis in that case. </p>

<p>There is the MAO-B inhibitor I spoke of, Selegiline, or Rasagiline. </p>

<p>High protein diet. Consistent exercise. There is a few ways to do it.</p>

<p>The resistance to Bromantane does not make sense to me either. However, my L-dopa theory might be right and that is well known.</p>

<p>So programme days off each week and don‚Äôt take as high of a dose. Go 5 days on and 2 days off each week. Personally I have only really used 10-20mg at a time. </p>

<p>The high protein diet &amp; exercise will further increase dopamine synthesis. The increase in tyrosine from your dietary protein will increase the substrate used to make dopamine. So you will further benefit from Bromantane usage.</p>

<p>The MAO-B inhibition helps keep it in the synapse instead of it being transported out and degraded. Its effects are mild so it would compound well without increasing L-dopa tolerance but also allowing you to increase dopamine activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve been dosing daily in the 50mg x 3-4 times per day (powder) or with the nasal spray maybe 2-3 times per day. I agree, I don‚Äôt feel anything acutely but also assume effects are cumulative‚Ä¶ so have been doing this for a few months now. I assume taking a break makes sense, not just for tolerance reasons, but I haven‚Äôt done that yet as I‚Äôm using it to help reduce other things that I‚Äôve been probably over-doing.</p>
