<h1>1. Why increase dopamine?</h1>

<p>Proper dopamine function is necessary for the drive to accomplish goals. Reductively, low dopamine can be characterized by pessimism and low motivation.</p>

<p>These conditions benefit most from higher dopamine:</p>

<li>And of course Parkinson&#39;s and ADHD<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30097390/"><sup>\</sup>2])</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of stimulants vary by condition, and likewise it may vary by stimulant class. For instance a mild dopaminergic effect may benefit those with social anxiety, low confidence, low motivation and anhedonia, but a narcoleptic may not fare the same.</p>

<p>In the future I may consider a more in-depth analysis on psychostimulant therapy, but for now revert to the summary.</p>

<h1>2. What are the downsides of stimulants?</h1>

<p>In the two sections to follow I hope to completely explain addiction, tolerance, withdrawal and neurotoxicity with psychostimulants. If you are not interested in pharmacology, you may either skip these passages or simply read the summaries.</p>

<h1>3. An analysis on addiction, tolerance and withdrawal</h1>

<p>Psychostimulant addiction and withdrawal have a common point of interest: behavioral sensitization, or rather structural synaptic changes enhanced by the presence of dopamine itself.<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1014269108"><sup>\</sup>66])</a> This dopamine-reliant loop biasedly reinforces reward by making it more rewarding at the expense of other potential rewards, and this underlies hedonic drive.</p>

<p>For example, stimulants stabilize attention in ADHD by making everything more rewarding. But as a consequence, learning is warped and addiction and dependence occurs.</p>

<p>The consequences of hedonism are well illustrated by stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization: aberrant neurogenesis<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7090037/"><sup>\</sup>16])</a><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/21/8491"><sup>\</sup>67])</a> forming after a single dose of amphetamine but lasting at least a year in humans.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17146013/"><sup>\</sup>68])</a> Due to this, low dose amphetamine can also be used to mimick psychosis with schizophrenia-like symptoms in chronic dosing primate models,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1395233"><sup>\</sup>69])</a> as well as produce long-lasting withdrawal upon discontinuation.</p>

<p><strong>Reliance on enkephalins:</strong> Behavioral sensitization (and by extension dopamine) is reliant on the opioid system. For this section, we&#39;ll refer to the medium spiny neurons that catalyze this phenomenon. Excitatory direct medium spiny neurons (DMSNs) experience dendritic outgrowth, whereas inhibitory indirect medium spiny neurons (IMSNs) act reclusive in the presence of high dopamine.<a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/133398"><sup>\</sup>70])</a> DMSNs are dopamine receptor D1-containing, and IMSNs are D2-containing, although DMSNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) contains both receptor types. Enkephalins prevent downregulation of the D1 receptor via RGS4, leading to preferential downregulation of D2.<a href="https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1423-0127-18-83"><sup>\</sup>65])</a> It&#39;s unclear to me if there is crosstalk between RGS4 and β-arrestins.</p>

<p><strong>Note on receptor density:</strong> G-protein-coupled receptors are composed of two binding regions: G proteins and β-arrestins. When β-arrestins are bound, receptors internalize (or downregulate). This leaves less receptors available for dopamine to bind to.</p>

<p>Since D2 acts to inhibit unnecessary signaling, the result is combination of dyskinesia, psychosis and addiction. Over time enkephalinergic signaling may decrease, as well as the C-Fos in dopamine receptors (which controls their sensitivity to dopamine) resulting in less plasticity of excitatory networks, making drug recovery a slow process.</p>

<p><strong>D1 negative feedback cascade:</strong> ↑D1 → ↑adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP → ↑CREB → (↑ΔFosB → ↑HDAC1 → ↓C-Fos   → receptor desensitization), ↑dynorphin → dopamine release inhibition</p>

<p><strong>D1 positive feedback cascade:</strong> ↑D1 → ↑adenylate cyclase → ↑cAMP → ↑CREB → (↑tyrosine hydoxylase → dopamine synthesis), neurogenesis, differentiation</p>

<p>Upon drug cessation, the effects of dynorphin manifest acutely as dysphoria. Naturally dynorphin functions by programming reward disengagement and fear learning. It does this in part by inhibiting dopamine release, but anti-serotonergic mechanisms are also at play.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3523715/"><sup>\</sup>71])</a> My theory is that this plays a role in both the antidepressant effects and cardiovascular detriment seen with KOR antagonists.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Psychostimulant addiction requires both D1<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2961413/"><sup>\</sup>72])</a> and the opioid system (due to enkephalin release downstream of D2 activation). Aberrant synaptogenesis occurs after single exposure to dopamine excess, but has long-lasting effects. Over time this manifests as dyskinesia, psychosis and addiction.</p>

<p>Tolerance and withdrawal, in regards to stimulants, involves the reduction of dopamine receptor sensitivity, as well as the reduction of dopamine.</p>

<p>The synaptogenic aspects of psychostimulants (behavioral sensitization) delay tolerance but it still occurs due to D2 downregulation and ΔFosB-induced dopamine receptor desensitization. Withdrawal encompasses the debt of tolerance, but it&#39;s worsened by behavioral sensitization, as both memory-responsive reward and the formation of new hedonic circuitry is impaired. Dynorphin also acutely inhibits the release of dopamine, adding to the detriment.</p>

<h1>4. An analysis on dopamine-induced neurotoxicity</h1>

<p>Dopamine excess, if left unchecked, is both neurotoxic and debilitating. The following discusses the roles of dopamine quinones like DOPAL, and enkephalin as potential candidates to explain this phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Dopamine&#39;s neurotoxic metabolite, DOPAL:</strong> Dopamine is degraded by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form DOPAL, an &quot;autotoxin&quot; that is destructive to dopamine neurons. Decades ago this discovery led to <em>MAO-B inhibitor</em> Selegiline being employed for Parkinson&#39;s treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Selegiline&#39;s controversy:</strong> Selegiline is often misconceived as solely inhibiting the conversion of dopamine to DOPAL, which in an ideal scenario would simultaneously reduce neurotoxicity and raise dopamine. But more recent data shows Selegiline acting primarily a catecholamine release enhancer (CAE), and that BPAP (another CAE) extends lifespan even more.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320516306257?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>22])</a> This points to dopamine promoting longevity, not reduced DOPAL. Increased locomotion could explain this occurence.</p>

<p>Additionally, MAO-A was found to be responsible for the degradation of dopamine, not MAO-B,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8333267/"><sup>\</sup>23])</a> thus suggesting an upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in dormant regions of the brain as Selegiline&#39;s primary therapeutic mechanism in Parkinson&#39;s. This would be secondary to inhibiting astrocytic GABA.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928877/"><sup>\</sup>24])</a> Tolerance forms to this effect, which is why patients ultimately resort to L-Dopa treatment.<a href="https://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/41/5/839"><sup>\</sup>25])</a> Selegiline has been linked to withdrawal<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs007020170089"><sup>\</sup>26])</a> but not addiction.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC1360227/"><sup>\</sup>27])</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary on Selegiline:</strong> This reflects negatively on Selegiline being used as a neuroprotective agent. Given this, it would appear that the <em>catecholaldehyde hypothesis</em> lacks proof of concept. That being said, DOPAL may still play a role in the neurotoxic effects of dopamine.</p>

<p><strong>Enkephalin excess is potentially neurotoxic:</strong> A convincing theory (my own, actually) is that opioid receptor agonism is at least partially responsible for the neurotoxic effect of dopamine excess. Recently multiple selective MOR agonists were shown to be direct neurotoxins, most notably Oxycodone,<a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-018-0417-0"><sup>\</sup>28])</a> and this was partially reversed through opioid receptor antagonism, but fully reversed by ISRIB.</p>

<p>In relation to stimulants, D2 activation releases enkephalins (scaling with the amount of dopamine), playing a huge role in addiction and behavioral sensitization.<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00222/full"><sup>\</sup>29])</a> Additionally, enkephalinergic neurons die after meth exposure due to higher dopamine<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03033973"><sup>\</sup>30])</a>, which they attribute to dopamine quinone metabolites, but perhaps it is enkephalin itself causing this. Enkephalin is tied to the behavioral and neuronal deficits in Alzheimer&#39;s<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3315282/"><sup>\</sup>31])</a> and oxidative stress<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143417904000526?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>32])</a> which signals apoptosis. Intermediate glutamatergic mechanisms are may be involved for this neurotoxicity. <em>In vitro</em> enkephalin has been found to inhibit cell proliferation, especially in glial cells, which are very important for cognition.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002432059090041O?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>33])</a> Unlike the study on prescription opioids, these effects were fully reversed by opioid receptor antagonists. It&#39;s unclear if enkephalin also activates integrated stress response pathways.</p>

<p><strong>Summary on enkephalin excess:</strong> This theory requires more validation, but it would appear as though dopamine-mediated enkephalin excess is neurotoxic through oxidative stress. This may be mediated by opioid receptors like MOR and DOR, but integrated stress response pathways could also be at fault.</p>

<p><strong>Antioxidants:</strong> Since oxidative stress is ultimately responsible for the neurotoxicity of dopamine excess, antioxidants have been used, with success, to reverse this phenomenon.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-008-9843-1"><sup>\</sup>44])</a> That being said, antioxidants inhibit PKC,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10924854/"><sup>\</sup>57])</a> and PKCβII is required for dopamine efflux through the DAT.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820807856"><sup>\</sup>55])</a> This is why antioxidants such as NAC and others have been shown to blunt amphetamine.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19277967/"><sup>\</sup>56])</a> TLR4 activation by inflammatory cytokines is also where methamphetamine gets some of its rewarding effects.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282647/"><sup>\</sup>58])</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary on antioxidants:</strong> Dopamine releasing agents are partially reliant on both oxidative stress and inflammation. Antioxidants can be used to prevent damage, but they may also blunt amphetamine (depending on the antioxidant). Anti-inflammatories may also be used, but direct TLR4 antagonists can reverse some of the rewarding effects these drugs have.</p>

<h1>5. Prescription stimulants and neurotoxicity</h1>

<p><strong>Amphetamine (Adderall):</strong> Amphetamine receives praise across much of reddit, but perhaps it isn&#39;t warranted. This isn&#39;t to say that stimulants aren&#39;t necessary. Their acute effects are very much proven. But here I question the long-term detriment of amphetamine.</p>

<p>Beyond the wealth of anecdotes, both online and in literature, of prescription-dose amphetamine causing withdrawal, there exists studies conducted in non-human primates using amphetamine that show <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/sm7ib5/low_dose_amphetamine_is_neurotoxic_causes_severe/">long-lasting axonal damage, withdrawal and schizotypal behavior from <strong>low dose</strong> amphetamine</a>. This suggests a dopamine excess. These studies are the result of chronic use, but it disproves the notion that it is only occurs at high doses. Due to there being no known genetic discrepancies between humans and non-human primates that would invalidate these studies, they remain relevant.</p>

<p>Additionally, amphetamine impairs episodic memory<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4244906/"><sup>\</sup>9])</a> and slows the rate of learning (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/pikxw0/review_of_pemoline_the_forgotten_nootropic/">Pemoline</a> as well, but less-so)<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4381149/"><sup>\</sup>10])</a> in healthy people. This, among other things, completely invalidates use of amphetamine as a <em>nootropic</em> substance.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneliu_E._Giurgea"><sup>\</sup>11])</a></p>

<p><strong>Methylphenidate (Ritalin):</strong> Low-dose methylphenidate is less harmful than amphetamine, but since its relationship with dopamine is linear,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327450/"><sup>\</sup>21])</a> it may still be toxic at higher doses. It suppresses C-Fos,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12692480/"><sup>\</sup>20])</a> but less-so<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20600661/"><sup>\</sup>19])</a> and only impairs cognition at high doses.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0163104781914813"><sup>\</sup>12])</a> Neurotoxicity would manifest through inhibited dopamine axon proliferation, which in one study led to an adaptive decrease in dopamine transporters, after being given during adolescence.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/104454601750143366"><sup>\</sup>13])</a></p>

<p>Dopamine releasing agents require a functional DAT in order to make it work in reverse, which is why true dopamine reuptake inhibition can weaken some stimulants while having a moderate dopamine-promoting effect on its own.<a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-6-220"><sup>\</sup>73])</a></p>

<p>Therefore I agree with the frequency at with Ritalin is prescribed over Adderall, however neither is completely optimal.</p>

<h1>6. Failed approaches to improving dopamine</h1>

<p><strong>Dopamine precursors:</strong> L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine are used as supplements, and L-Dopa is found in both supplements and prescription medicine.</p>

<p>Both L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine can be found in diet, and endogenously they experience a <em>rate-limited</em> conversion to L-Dopa by tyrosine hydroxylase. L-Dopa freely converts to dopamine but L-Tyrosine does not freely convert to L-Dopa.</p>

<p>As elaborated further in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics_that_upregulate_dopamine_v20/">prior posts</a>, supplementation with L-Tyrosine or L-Phenylalanine is only effective in a deficiency, and the likelihood of having one is slim. Excess of these amino acids can not only <em>decrease</em> dopamine, but produce oxidative stress.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18602789/"><sup>\</sup>14])</a> This makes their classification as <em>nootropics</em> unlikely. Their benefits to stimulant comedown may be explained by stimulants suppressing appetite.</p>

<p>L-Dopa (Mucuna Pruriens in supplement form), come with many side effects,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA"><sup>\</sup>15])</a> so much so that it was unusable in older adults for the purpose of promoting cognition. In fact, it impaired learning and memory and mainly caused side effects.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7090037/"><sup>\</sup>16])</a></p>

<p><strong>Uridine monophosphate/ triacetyluridine:</strong> A while back &quot;Mr. Happy Stack&quot; was said to upregulate dopamine receptors, and so many people took it envisioning improved motivation, better energy levels, etc. but that is not the case.</p>

<p>Uridine works primarily through inhibiting the release of dopamine using a GABAergic mechanism, which increases dopamine receptor D2, an inhibitory dopamine receptor, and this potentiates antipsychotics.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019701868990082X?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>59])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2906500/"><sup>\</sup>60])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25088943/"><sup>\</sup>61])</a> Uridine is solidified as an <em>antidopaminergic</em> substance. In order for a substance to be labeled a &quot;dopamine upregulator&quot;, its effects must persist after discontinuation.</p>

<p>Furthermore the <em>real</em> Mr. Happy was not paid a dime by the companies who sold products under his name.</p>

<p><strong>9-Me-BC (9-Methyl-β-carboline):</strong> Years after the introduction of this compound to the nootropics community, there is still no evidence it&#39;s safe. Not even in rodent models. The debate about its proposed conversion to a neurotoxin is controversial, but the idea that it &quot;upregulates dopamine&quot; or &quot;upregulates dopamine receptors&quot; is not, nor is it founded on science.</p>

<p>Its ability to inhibit MAO-A and MAO-B is most likely soley responsible for its dopaminergic effects. Additionally, I ran it through predictive analysis software, and it was flagged as a potential carcinogen on both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/s4af1o/predicted_toxicity_for_9mebc/">ADMETlab</a> and ProTox.</p>

<h1>7. How Bromantane upregulates dopamine and protects the brain</h1>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Bromantane is non-addictive, and as opposed to withdrawal, shows moderate dopaminergic effects even 1-2 months after its discontinuation.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11109517/"><sup>\</sup>34])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19491814/"><sup>\</sup>35])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/"><sup>\</sup>37])</a> It is not overly stimulating,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3762282/"><sup>\</sup>36])</a> actually reduces anxiety,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/"><sup>\</sup>37])</a> reduces work errors, and improves physical endurance as well as learning.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10934588/"><sup>\</sup>38])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10998997/"><sup>\</sup>39])</a> Its dopaminergic effects also improve sex-drive.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15341065/"><sup>\</sup>40])</a> It is banned from sports organizations due to its nature as a performance enhancing drug.</p>

<p><strong>Bromantane&#39;s clinical success in neurasthenia:</strong> Bromantane, in Russia, was approved for neurasthenia, which is similar to the west&#39;s Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - &quot;disease of modernization&quot;.<a href="https://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/45318/1/73169.pdf?accept=1"><sup>\</sup>18])</a> Its results are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a large-scale, multi-center clinical trial of 728 patients diagnosed with asthenia, bromantane was given for 28 days at a daily dose of 50 mg or 100 mg. The impressiveness were 76.0% on the CGI-S and 90.8% on the CGI-I, indicating broadly-applicable, high effectiveness...  </p>

<p>...We determined clinical efficacy of ladasten in regard to anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders, autonomic dystonia, and sleep disorders. Ladasten therapy led to the significant increase of quality of life, which was seen not only after the end of therapy, but after the withdrawal of the drug. These results suggest the stability of the therapeutic effect achieved. Adverse effects were observed only in 3% of patients, the therapy was discontinued in 0.8%. No serious adverse effects were found.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/"><sup>\</sup>37])</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bromantane&#39;s mechanisms:</strong> Bromantane&#39;s stimulatory effect is caused by increased dopamine synthesis, which it achieves through elevating CREB.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028390807002109?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>74])</a> Dopamine blocks tyrosine hydroxylase, and CREB disinhibits this enzyme, leading to more dopamine being synthesized.</p>

<p>That is the mechanism by which it increases dopamine, but the Russian authors give us little context as to how we get there. Due to striking similarity (both chemically and pharmacologically), my hypothesis is that Bromantane, like Amantadine, is a Kir2.1 channel inhibitor. This stabilizes IMSNs in the presence of high dopamine and thus prevents aberrant synaptogenesis. In human models this is evidenced by a reduction in both OFF-time (withdrawal) and ON-time (sensitization).<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd181565"><sup>\</sup>80])</a> Bromantane relates to this mechanism by promoting work optimization and more calculated reflexes.</p>

<p>Through immunosuppression, Amantadine alleviates inflammatory cytokines, leading to an indirect inhibition to HDAC that ultimately upregulates neurotrophins such as BDNF and GDNF.<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605330/full"><sup>\</sup>76])</a> This transaction is simultaneously responsible for its neuroprotective effects to dopamine neurons.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21586298/"><sup>\</sup>42])</a> Bromantane reduces inflammatory cytokines<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22288152/"><sup>\</sup>75])</a> and was shown to inhibit HDAC as well.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22235395/"><sup>\</sup>77])</a> Literature suspects its sensitizing properties to be mediated through neurotrophins<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10517-012-1516-z"><sup>\</sup>78])</a> and indeed the benefits of GDNF infusions in Parkinson&#39;s last years after discontinuation.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3795600/"><sup>\</sup>79])</a></p>

<p>Amantadine&#39;s sensitizing effect to dopamine neurons, as a standalone, build tolerance after a week.<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605330/full"><sup>\</sup>81])</a> This does not rule out Kir2.1 channel inhibition as being a target of Bromantane, as tolerance and withdrawal are not exactly the same due to the aforementioned discrepancies. Rather, it suggests that Bromantane&#39;s effect on neurotrophins is much stronger than that of Amantadine.</p>

<p>Given its anti-fibrotic<a href="https://algernonpharmaceuticals.com/ckd-np-160/"><sup>\</sup>43])</a> and protective effects at mitochondria and cellular membranes,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9929819/"><sup>\</sup>39])</a> it could have unforeseen antioxidant effects such as Bemethyl, but that is yet to be discovered. On that note, Bemethyl is said to be another adaptogenic drug. Despite much searching, I found no evidence to back this up, although its safety and nootropic effect is well documented.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> In addition to clinical trials indicating safety and as evidenced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics_that_upregulate_dopamine_v20/">past works</a>, absurd doses are required to achieve the amyloidogenic effects of Bromantane, which are likely due to clinically insignificant anticholinergic effects. More specifically, β-amyloids may present at 589-758.1mg in humans. A lethal dose of Bromantane translates to roughly 40672-52348mg.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Bromantane increases dopamine synthesis, balances excitatory and inhibitory neural networks, and increases neurotrophins by reducing neuroinflammation through epigenetic mechanisms. Increased dopamine receptor density is not necessary for the upregulatory action of Bromantane.</p>

<p><strong>Bromantane nasal spray:</strong> On <a href="https://bromantane.co/">https://bromantane.co/</a> I have created the first Bromantane nasal spray product. It is both more effective and equally as safe. More about that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/sfisay/a_breakdown_on_bromantane_nasal_spray/">here</a>. I&#39;m proud to announce that the community&#39;s results with it have been objectively better.</p>

<h1>8. How ALCAR upregulates dopamine and protects the brain</h1>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine) is a cholinergic, antioxidant, and neuroprotective drug shown to increase dopamine output long after discontinuation.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1395896"><sup>\</sup>45])</a> Additionally it is a clinically superior antidepressant in older populations, compared to SSRIs<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q5s1vk/alcar_equally_efficacious_in_treating_depression/"><sup>\</sup>46])</a> and was shown to improve ADD, yet not ADHD, strangely.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18315451/"><sup>\</sup>48])</a> It helps fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis better than Amantadine<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14759641/"><sup>\</sup>47])</a> pointing to it possibly helping CFS, and has a protective effect in early cognitive decline in Alzheimer&#39;s patients.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14759641/"><sup>\</sup>49])</a></p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> ALCAR is safe and well tolerated in clinical trials, but anecdotally many people dislike it. This may be due to its cholinergic effects, acetylcholine giving rise to cortisol.<a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinicalneuropharm/Citation/1988/10000/Acetyl_L_Carnitine_Acutely_Administered_Raises.9.aspx"><sup>\</sup>50])</a> There is no proof it increases TMAO, but there is a chance it <em>might</em> after conversion to L-Carnitine. Even so, it has a protective effect on the heart.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6984015/"><sup>\</sup>51])</a> Likewise, there is no proof it causes hypothyroidism, only that it may improve hyperthyroidism.</p>

<p><strong>ALCAR&#39;s mechanisms:</strong> What both Bromantane and ALCAR have in common is their influence on HDAC. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics_that_upregulate_dopamine_v20/">Reference</a>. Instead of inhibiting HDAC, ALCAR donates an acetyl group to proteins deacetylated by HDAC1, which blocks the downregulatory effect of ΔFosB on C-Fos, promoting dopamine receptor sensitivity. Additionally this promotes GDNF<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20302919/"><sup>\</sup>53])</a> and these together could be how it upregulates dopamine output, or how it helps meth withdrawal.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/s55k1y/effects_of_acetyllcarnitine_terguride_and/"><sup>\</sup>52])</a> ALCAR&#39;s donation of an acetyl group to choline also makes it a potent cholinergic, and that combined with its antioxidant effects are likely responsible for its neuroprotection.</p>

<p>ALCAR&#39;s dose seems to plateau at 1500mg orally despite its low oral bioavailability as indicated in my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/n8iqey/the_oral_bioavailability_of_every_nootropic_84/">post on the absorption of nootropics</a> but one study in people shows recovery from alcohol-induced anhedonia is only possible with injected ALCAR, as opposed to oral.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21256179/"><sup>\</sup>54])</a> Unfortunately there does not seem to be a cost efficient way to enhance the bioavailability of ALCAR yet (i.e. ALCAR cyclodextrin), and intranasal is not advisable.</p>

<h1>9. Conclusion</h1>

<p>Dopamine is a vital neurotransmitter that can be increased for the benefit of many. Addiction, psychosis and dyskinesia are linked through synaptogenic malfunction, where the opioid system plays a key role. On the other hand, tolerance can be attributed to receptor desensitization and withdrawal involves receptor desensitization, synaptogenic malfunction and dynorphin.</p>

<p>There have been many flawed strategies to increase dopamine, from Selegiline, dopamine precursors, Uridine Monophosphate, dopamine releasing agents and others, but the most underappreciated targets are neurotrophins such as GDNF. This is most likely why Bromantane and ALCAR have persistent benefits even long after discontinuation. Given its similarity to Amantadine, it&#39;s also highly likely that Bromantane is capable of preventing psychotic symptoms seen with other psychostimulants.</p>

<h1>An important message from the author of this post</h1>

<p><strong>Backstory:</strong> I want to start this off by thanking this community for allowing me to rise above my circumstances. As many of you know, biohacking and pharmacology are more than a hobby to me, but a passion. I believe my purpose is to enhance people&#39;s mental abilities on a large scale, but I have never been able to do so until now due to a poor family, health issues and a downward spiral that happened a few years back before I even knew what nootropics were.</p>

<p>Through the use of nootropics alone I was able to cure my depression (Agmatine Sulfate 1g twice daily), quit addictions (NAC), and improve my productivity (Bromantane, ALCAR, Pemoline, etc.). Autoimmunity is something I still struggle with but it has gotten much better in the past year. I can say now that I am at least mostly functional. So I would like to dedicate my life towards supporting this industry.</p>

<p>My goal is to create a &quot;<a href="https://science.bio">science.bio</a>-like&quot; website, but with products I more personally believe in. The nootropics of today&#39;s market I am not very impressed by, and I hope to bring a lot more novel substances to light. If you want to support me through this process, please share my work or my website. Really anything helps, thankyou! I will continue to investigate pharmacology as I always have.</p>

<p>Just a quick disclaimer, as prescription medicine is discussed: don&#39;t take my words as medical advice. This differs from my personal opinion that educated and responsible people can think for themselves, but I digress. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before my mini rant, let me say I do love your posts and all the work you put into them, and I wish there were more folks like you. So don’t read the following in the wrong way.</p>

<p>Now you seem to encourage folks to get off stimulants which is great, but I think you might not understand fully where most people are at, and just how far they have to be lifted up to get into the functional range, not to even mention an optimal range.</p>

<p>I would LOVE to replace amphetamines with anything else that is less harmful and/or more beneficial but bromantane+acalr did not do the trick. </p>

<p>I unfortunately don’t understand it enough but my experience and intuition says that it’s more complex than just dopamine regulation.</p>

<p>Imagine multiple bars indicating various metrics of things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Mental anxiety/restlessness </li>
<li>  Physical anxiety </li>
<li>  Motivation/Resistance</li>
<li>  Working memory </li>
<li>  Cognitive processing power/speed</li>
<li>  Alertness/energy</li>
<li>  Focus/being able to stay on task</li>
</ul>

<p>Etc etc. </p>

<p>Various things you take affect those various verticals acutely and over time. </p>

<p>Maybe B&amp;A affect some of these in some people but I suspect, like me, for many people they don’t move the needle on things like cognitive processing and working memory. So maybe I can start a task and stay on it but I feel like I can’t think and process anything. </p>

<p>Find me anything that targets enough of these in the right combination/amount to allow people to function and they’ll toss their Adderall in an instance.</p>

<p>The problem could be something else all together and each person is different and these things are hard to diagnose so I still appreciate the work even if it hasn’t helped me as it may help others. I guess I can’t help but react to a call to stop stimulants when I feel that I can’t (mind you I’m not even taking a lot or every day).</p>

<p>Thanks again for all the knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that many people are fans of amphetamine, but don&#39;t act like that&#39;s the only drug on earth capable of treating ADHD. I explicitly state that not all drugs work for all conditions i.e. narcolepsy, and that bromantane is a &quot;moderate&quot; stimulant. And this is reflected with the study in amantadine: <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cap.2006.0128">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cap.2006.0128</a></p>

<p>Like I state in the post, methylphenidate makes more sense than amphetamine, even.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s also modafinil: <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022395616301777">https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022395616301777</a></p>

<p>Piracetam: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15071842/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15071842/</a></p>

<p>And more. So Bromantane and ALCAR aside, lashing out every time someone criticizes amphetamine is not justified. And btw, many people were non-responders before Bromantane nasal spray, so it&#39;s not a fair comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I&#39;ve taken Adderall since elementary school, and I&#39;m in college now. It definitely isn&#39;t an ideal solution. I developed OCD-like tendencies, at times I had paranoid and delusional thoughts, and stimulants seem to blunt my personality. If I watched a sad movie on Adderall, I would be unable to cry. I have difficulty feeling any level of empathy while on Adderall. It sucks. Currently, as it is, I have to take Adderall to make it through college. I take the minimum effective dose, and only when I need to get work done. Still though, it often feels like Adderall slowly changes who I am to be someone I&#39;d rather not be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely curious about the combination of Bromantane and ALCAR. I can&#39;t stop taking Adderall yet. So, I&#39;m curious, would it be advisable to try Bromantane+ALCAR combo while still taking Adderall? Or should I wait until a period of my life in which I can try Bromantane+ALCAR on its own? Let me know, and thanks for the post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could but my opinion is that it may also be worth it to employ alternative strategies that are better proven as well if it doesn&#39;t work. Piracetam, Modafinil etc. are all shown to have an effect on ADHD. Amantadine is too, so perhaps Bromantane, but there&#39;s no saying if it would be enough.</p>

<p>ALCAR also only treated ADD, and not ADHD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, is <a href="https://bromantane.co/">https://bromantane.co/</a> legit? I was looking for the Tabernanthalog....</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Researchers found that a single dose of tabernanthalog (TBG) can correct stress-induced behavioral deficits, including anxiety and cognitive inflexibility, and also promotes the regrowth of neuronal connections and restores neural circuits in the brain that are disrupted by stress. The study was published May 25 in Molecular Psychiatry.&quot; source (</strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/tabernanthalog.html">https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/tabernanthalog.html</a>)</p>

<p>wait for it...</p>

<p>&quot;The compound 7,8-dihydroxyflavone mimics BDNF, one of the brain&#39;s own growth factors, and can protect brain cells against damage in animal models of seizure, stroke and Parkinson&#39;s disease. 7,8-dihydroxyflavone is a member of a family of antioxidant compounds naturally found in foods ranging from cherries to soybeans.&quot; (source <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100125173459.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100125173459.htm</a></p>

<p>also: 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), a naturally-occurring plant-based flavone, is a high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) agonist and a bioactive molecule of therapeutic interest for neuronal survival, differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. In the family of neurotrophic factors, this small BDNF-mimetic molecule has attracted considerable attention due to its oral bioavailability and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. source <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018621001145">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018621001145</a></p>

<p>&quot;Natually just mix those two for neuroplastic... or psychoplastogen.. . Therefore, a substantial amount of effort has been directed toward the identification of compounds that mimic the beneficial effects of ketamine. To classify compounds like ketamine capable of altering neural circuits by rapidly promoting plasticity (Figure 1), and to distinguish them from other slow-acting molecules that induce plasticity, we have recently introduced the term “psychoplastogen,” from the Greek roots psych- (mind), -plast (molded), and -gen (producing).3&quot; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1179069518800508">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1179069518800508</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>TrkB</p>

<p>Rationale: It is widely recognized that methamphetamine (METH) induces behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its specific receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase (TrkB), in METH-induced behavioral abnormalities.<br/>
Objective: In this study, we examined whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a novel potent TrkB agonist, could attenuate behavioral abnormalities and dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH.<br/>
Results: Pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10, or 30 mg/kg), but not the inactive TrkB compound, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF) (30 mg/kg), attenuated hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose-dependent manner. The development of behavioral sensitization after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg/day, once daily for 5 days) was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg). Furthermore, pretreatment and subsequent administration of 7,8-DHF (10 mg/kg) attenuated the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum after repeated administration of METH (3.0 mg/kg × 3 at 3-hourly intervals). Treatment with ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a potent TrkB antagonist, blocked the protective effects of 7,8-DHF on the METH-induced reduction of DAT in the striatum. Moreover, 7,8-DHF attenuated microglial activation in the striatum after repeated administration of METH.<br/>
Conclusions: These findings suggest that 7,8-DHF can ameliorate behavioral abnormalities as well as dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice after administration of METH. It is likely, therefore, that TrkB agonists such as 7,8-DHF may prove to be potential therapeutic drugs for several symptoms associated with METH abuse in humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>vSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) signaling pathway plays a role in behavioral abnormalities observed after administration of psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine (METH). This study was undertaken to examine whether the potent TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) could improve prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits in mice seen after a single dose of METH. Treatment with 7,8-DHF (3.0, 10 or 30 mg/kg) improved PPI deficits in mice associated with exposure to METH (3.0 mg/kg), in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, co-administration of ANA-12 (0.5 mg/kg), a TrkB antagonist, significantly blocked the effects of 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) on METH-induced PPI deficits. In contrast, administration of 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (5,7-DHF: 30 mg/kg), an inactive TrkB ligand, did not affect METH-induced PPI deficits in mice. An in vivo microdialysis study in conscious mice showed that 7,8-DHF (30 mg/kg) significantly attenuated increased dopamine release in the striatum, after METH administration (3 mg/kg). This study suggests that 7,8-DHF can improve PPI deficits in these mice, through the inhibition of METH-induced dopamine release. Therefore, it is likely that TrkB agonists, such as 7,8-DHF, may constitute a novel class of therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases such as METH-use disorder and schizophrenia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is an interesting review of general neurobiology a la addiction mechanisms. However, there is an abundance of overly-strong wording that implies a definite effect in humans via extrapolation of rat and primate studies. There are severe apparent limitations to this, especially from a statistical, behavioral, and clinical standpoint, even if primates at first might seem like the ideal model. Unfortunately, as is often the case, things are more complicated than they may appear. I mainly comment on amphetamine and addiction because there is actually quite a bit of human data on this that can be applied here.</p>

<h2><strong>Reward, Addiction, and Withdrawal</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, stimulants stabilize attention in ADHD by making everything more rewarding. But as a consequence, learning is warped and addiction and dependence occurs.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed. You can&#39;t claim that &quot;learning is warped&quot; and &quot;addiction and dependence&quot; occur in ADHD as if this is a given... This is contrary to the truth that the majority of patients who do not get addicted to these chemicals. There is also no increase in substance abuse potential in adults (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4147667/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4147667/</a>) and children (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-research-suggests-stimulant-treatment-adhd-does-not-contribute-substance-abuse-later-life">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-research-suggests-stimulant-treatment-adhd-does-not-contribute-substance-abuse-later-life</a>) prescribed amphetamine nor methylphenidate. Do you really think the vast majority of people, if for some reason their doctor stopped rx&#39;ing their stimulant, would buy stimulants illegally? No.. They&#39;d be pissed off or disappointed, but the fact that there&#39;s no demonstrated increase of substance use risk to people prescribed them means your assumption of people prescribed stimulants becoming addicted is baseless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The consequences of hedonism are well illustrated by stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization: aberrant neurogenesis[16][67] forming after a single dose of amphetamine but lasting at least a year in humans.[68] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does this study (68) reflect the &quot;consequences of hedonism... in humans?&quot; </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The study had n = 10 and n = 7 on the one-year follow up. These numbers are incredibly low and means that at LEAST one or two of the variables they had were bound to show the result they want. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_p-values</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/882/">https://xkcd.com/882/</a> for a satirical, yet critically true, point.</p></li>
<li><p>Indeed, as in (1), the study showed NO effect on &quot;euphoria,&quot; &quot;anxiousness,&quot; or &quot;drug wanting.&quot; However, they did show demonstrated of the sensitization on &quot;energy&quot; (P=.03; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.06), &quot;alertness&quot; (VAS alert:
F4,36=11.6, P&lt;.001; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.048), &quot;clearheadedness&quot; (POMS clearheaded: F4,36=3.02; P=.05; dose
1 vs dose 4: P=.009), and &quot;positive mood&quot; (POMS agreeable: F4,36 =3.68, P=.04; dose 1 vs dose 4: P=.002). Note that when one p-value did not show or was on the verge of statistical significance, they simply ignored it and accepted the other one. With such a small sample size, wide number of variables, and borderline significance, you can claim just about anything, but a simple few point difference in a single person would have changed the entire outcome from &quot;no effect&quot; to &quot;effect&quot; or vice-versa, so there&#39;s really nothing conclusive here I don&#39;t think, especially in chronic use, which isn&#39;t considered. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>3. If anything, the <strong>results of this study support the opposite of your points</strong>. There&#39;s no increase in addictive measure (euphoria, drug wanting), but there is of focus, clear-headedness, and mood. So, that amphetamine &quot;makes everything more rewarding&quot; to the point of &quot;addiction and dependence&quot; are NOT supported by this data. Further, the idea that it supports a &quot;hedonistic&quot; mindset (defined as &quot;striving to experience pleasure, enjoyment, and comfort (Huta and Ryan 2010)... The definition focuses on striving for such experiences rather than having them&quot; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9485-0">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9485-0</a>) is also not supported by the data, which you cite to make the opposite point.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to this, low dose amphetamine can also be used to mimick psychosis with schizophrenia-like symptoms in chronic dosing primate models,[69] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, but &quot;low-dose&quot; amphetamine doesn&#39;t mimic psychosis in humans (people rx&#39;ed it for ADHD do not spontaneously develop psychosis or it wouldn&#39;t be approved by the FDA...), so how does the primate comparison really have relevance? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>as well as produce long-lasting withdrawal upon discontinuation.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed (human). Also, define &quot;long-lasting.&quot; Let&#39;s turn up the stakes from amphetamine therapeutic use to methamphetamine abuse to make a point. In humans, depression, obsession, psychoticism, anxiety, phobia, paranoia, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, and more are considered to not be present after 1-2 weeks of abstinence. This was one of, if not the largest and longest stimulant withdrawal studies in humans as of 2015 when it was published; it does not rely on primate or rat data. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3071736/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3071736/</a>
The only symptom that continued past these (up to 5 weeks, as the study is) was drug craving. This is a confounding variable obviously (this is a study of methamphetamine addicts, so the data is not heterogenous to those without addictive predisposition). Because therapeutic doses are not associated with  increases in drug abuse (adult and children, see above), and because those doses are obviously much lower, one could imagine a lower propensity of depression, obsession, drug wanting, etc., most of which would not persist past a few weeks, in normal users. </p>

<p>Also, do not forget, these results are in the CHRONIC use of HIGH doses stimulants. Despite pharmacokinetic dose &quot;equivalence&quot; between primates and humans, your study 69 shows many withdrawal effects that terminate after only 4 days. Either way, as evidenced by the primate psychosis paradigm you highlight, an equivalent effect in humans is not demonstrated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But here I question the long-term detriment of amphetamine.<br/>
Beyond the wealth of anecdotes, both online and in literature, of prescription-dose amphetamine causing withdrawal, there exists studies conducted in non-human primates using amphetamine that show long-lasting axonal damage, withdrawal and schizotypal behavior from low dose amphetamine. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again critically, <em>not in humans</em>. All withdrawal symptoms but one above were found to dissipate after 1 week. On the other point, humans who are not especially predisposed to psychotic symptoms (i.e. most of them, including those with ADHD to whom they&#39;re prescribed) do not exhibit psychosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These studies are the result of chronic use, but it disproves the notion that it is only occurs at high doses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t &quot;disprove&quot; anything. It shows one or two examples of association in the primate brain. If withdrawal symptoms dissipate after 1-2 weeks in high doses of methamphetamine abuse in humans, why would low doses of amphetamine use present clinically significant symptoms for a year? The behavioral sensitization study showed neurobiological changes after a year in humans, but it did not show clear, statistical behavioral outcomes. </p>

<h2><strong>Cognition</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, amphetamine impairs episodic memory[9] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This summary leaves out crucial info from this study, which has information contradictory to it. The study cited around a dozen studies showing <em>increases</em> in working memory, episodic memory <em>consolidation</em>, attention, associative learning, and cognitive flexibility from amphetamine. The study characterizes impairments in episode memory <em>retrieval</em>. Consolidation is largely related to how working memory feeds thru the hippocampus and encodes information in a way that involves cross-modal cortical association areas. Retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on pre-formed cortical networks.</p>

<p>If attention and memory consolidation are raised, then later recall would be  improved. However, this study isolates the effects of amphetamine <em>only</em> to the retrieval day. The study supports that amphetamine increases the ability to form memories if taken when learning, but interferes with the ability to recall memories by proxy of increased confidence reflected in an increased error rate. Note that there wasn&#39;t a decrease in correct responses, but an increase of incorrect responses (and only of a certain type of stimulus). So, the solution would to be <em>take amphetamine when learning AND retrieving, not just retrieving</em>. If you don&#39;t encode it more strongly in the first place, then you can&#39;t really recall it stronger later...</p>

<p>This calls upon the idea of &quot;context-dependent learning&quot;. If you take amphetamine to learn and experience an increase in encoding, you will perform better if you also take amphetamine on retrieval. On the other hand, if you do not take amphetamine when you learn something, then you will do better if you do not take amphetamine when retrieving. This is why people with ADHD are told to take their stimulant when testing only if they took it while studying. </p>

<p>and slows the rate of learning (Pemoline as well, but less-so)[10] in healthy people. This, among other things, completely invalidates use of amphetamine as a nootropic substance.[11]  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see that they list five criteria for &quot;nootropic,&quot; but I&#39;m just going to focus on the first one (learning and memory) for simplicity sake and because this post is getting long.</p>

<p>Study 9 looked at a single aspect (recall) of a single type of memory (episodic declarative) in n = 34 participants while specifically negating context-dependent memory. Here I present an analysis of 1,300+ participants across a variety of cognitive domains for amphetamine:</p>

<p>&quot;We found evidence for small but significant stimulant enhancement effects on inhibitory control
and short-term episodic memory. Small effects on working memory reached significance, based on one
of our two analytical approaches. Effects on delayed episodic memory were medium in size.&quot; (The other effects, such as long-term memory, had publication bias and so they did not conclude anything on it.) <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&amp;context=neuroethics_pubs">https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&amp;context=neuroethics_pubs</a>. </p>

<p>Note that this is in healthy subjects, who are much less likely to benefit than a person with a cognitive deficit, such as ADHD. Despite this, there seems to be a small-medium benefit in a variety of cognitive domains (there&#39;s unfortunately no &quot;Limitless&quot; pill yet... darn), particularly working memory (aka &quot;short-term&quot; memory or cognition) and episodic memory (a form of long-term memory), the former of which I believe is more relevant for nootropic users to care about over episodic (which is more associated with memory than cognition). </p>

<hr/>

<p>Off of healthy subjects, subjects with ADHD achieve neuronal patterns that more closely resemble healthy subjects after chronic amphetamine use (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3801446/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3801446/</a>). This was observed by analyzing 29 imaging studies, mainly fMRI. This should further speak to the fact that chronic amphetamine use in rodents and even primates != those in humans, in whom the benefits may be greater.</p>

<p>0_o what? Where did a discussion on genetics come from? It doesn&#39;t matter if only 1% of the DNA is different; the human and primate brains are incredibly different from a neuronal and neurophysiological perspective.

<p>Because behavioral sensitization becomes addiction with repeated use, but begins after a single dose. That was why I included that study.

<p>No. &quot;Even at 20 months postdrug treatment, some monkeys continued to show aberrant behaviors in the absence of additional pharmacological challenge.&quot; This study also shows 9-15 month impairments to locomotion, a sign of decreased dopamine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true, I&#39;ll edit that line to be more specific to what it impairs.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true, though, memory is inseperable from cognition, as well as learning. And you&#39;re missing the point. While stimulants are known to improve some aspects of cognition, amphetamine fails because it&#39;s not neuroprotective and has side effects. The improvement to some things with detriment to others doesn&#39;t help its case either.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more comedic, the fact that this was posted to <a href="https://psychiatry.com">psychiatry.com</a> or the page-long list of funding disclosures.

Why do you still not understand that Tyrosine Hydroxylase is rate limited despite it being common knowledge that Tyrosine Hydroxylase upregulation underlies the neuropharmacological benefits of many drugs, and that L-Tyrosine has failed in many circumstances.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you think you&#39;re doing the right thing with your persistent attempts to detract from my work (I know my stance is not public opinion due to years of misinformation), but the truth of the matter is that you&#39;re not right about this stuff and even worse you&#39;re rationalizing the use of amphetamine and methamphetamine and slowing the innovative process.</p>

<p>The sensitization effect you described in the human study from before again showed only half of the measures reaching statistical significance, *none of which were related to the addicting effects*. And, of the half that did reach significance, the significance was weak best. Further, even if every single effect did reach significance and showed clear sensitization, you realize that this was mainly based on subjective self-reports, right? They show a lack of sensitization in drug-wanting, euphoria, etc., have weak statistics, have an extremely small n, and do not have objective outcomes.    </p>

<p>As for the new study you listed, yes, RATS show this, but you don&#39;t point to any evidence of human use at normal doses. I&#39;m not sure to which citation in there you&#39;re referring specifically, but they reference associations of impulsivity and DRUG USE several times in humans. How is this relevant to therapeutic, normal dose use of stimulants at all?   </p>

<p>People with ADHD may have a higher chance than the average person in the population to be impulsive and start using drugs, but <em>the use of amphetamine itself in those with ADHD is NOT associated with higher drug use</em>, to which I&#39;ve provided two substantially large citations. Your reasoning that amphetamine use in people with ADHD is due to their higher addictive disposition is thus far unfounded. The sensitization effect, even if present, does not appear to worsen actual outcome with respect to addiction potential.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware. I never said they were worthless. They are extremely useful. Rodents point toward research to be done in humans, <em>but the rodent studies themselves cannot be directly extrapolated to humans without this</em>. You can theorize all you want from rat studies, but you can argue that the same effects will show up in humans until you&#39;re blue in the face, but that doesn&#39;t make it true. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how they define &quot;right,&quot; or what data these were looking at. But for example, say researchers show that abusing amphetamine causing addiction and sensitization in rats and then predict it would also occur and decide to study it in humans. If they show any effect at all, then the prediction was &quot;correct,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean that the degree/severity of it is behaviorally relevant in humans. Lastly, this was from the early 1960s! I shouldn&#39;t even need to say why a retroactive study on animal model accuracy in humans from this period wouldn&#39;t be relevant...  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I did read it, did you? It talks about substance abuse and addiction, including the &quot;possession and use of illegal substances.&quot; Substance abuse is a PREREQUISITE for addiction, so these results indirectly incorporate the addiction potential of the substance. They say, &quot;One possible mechanism would be that ADHD medication leads to less exposure to substances and, thus, less chance of developing dependence or addiction.&quot; </p>

<p>I further present studies which do not rely on hospitalizations.
&quot;The use of stimulants to treat ADHD has been controversial
for some years, in part as a result of speculation
that exposure to stimulant therapy somehow leads directly
to substance abuse. This persistent fear has been generated
somewhat by the fact that stimulants have a potential
for abuse in spite of the fact that there is little responsible
evidence that this [that stimulant prescriptions lead to it] is actually the case.&quot;
<a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/4662/">https://www.psychiatrist.com/read-pdf/4662/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Despite some discrepancies among the findings of the 7 studies, the meta-analysis demonstrated that exposure to stimulant therapy for ADHD does not increase the risk for developing substance use disorders but is, in fact, protective against it. Stimulant treatment of ADHD appears to reduce the risk for substance use disorders by 50%, thus reducing the risk for substance use disorders in ADHD youth to levels well within the normal population risk.&quot;

</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant? So the RAT models of addiction are superior to ADHD models of humans to predict results in humans? The truth is, we don&#39;t have human data on long-term use of the addictive potential of stimulants in clinically healthy people, and probably will not for a long time. I&#39;m using the available data that we have. The HUMAN data does not support that acute use of amphetamine will lead to addiction. Humans have more self-control than rats in case you haven&#39;t noticed, despite possible sensitization effects that may occur.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; anybody. I&#39;m trying to present the facts of human research.</p>

<p>Acute studies in healthy people (without ADHD) show minor-moderate benefit on several aspects of cognition, as I linked before. Your personally being against amphetamine is fine, but that does not mean that the effects you claim in humans are necessarily true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s a study that does show the development of behavioral sensitization, tolerance, euphoria and drug-wanting/ drug-wanting in low dose amphetamine in HUMANS: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1395696">https://www.nature.com/articles/1395696</a> interestingly also showing some differences between men and women as well. This also backs up my use of hedonism, which is self-indulgence, not the sub-par definition you used. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hedonism is about not only self-indulgence but the <em>pursuit</em> of self-indulgence; my &quot;sub-par&quot; definition incorporates what you say into it. Regardless, from your own study: &quot;In summary, we observed significant progressive increases in <em>some</em> subjective behavioral ratings following repeated d-amphetamine administration, which may serve as a human model for behavioral sensitization. <em>However, a decrease or tolerance to drug liking also seemed to occur, suggesting a separate process from these other behavioral ratings.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This again suggests that it is not as simple as just sensitization like in rats. There are changes in behavior with repeated use that OPPOSE each other; this is also relevant in the other study on human sensitization you linked before that are at play. Further, humans have a different degree of self-control, and have not been found to have increased potential to abuse substances (which is a pre-requisite for addiction). </p>

<p>I did not say that it isn&#39;t linked to depression! I said that the incidence of depression mostly decreased after 2 weeks of abstinence. </p>

<p>As for cognition, my original study did not mention that. The effects of the withdrawal are wide and varied. So far, no affective symptoms have been shown to last longer than a week or two. The only effects that persisted were drug wanting (my study) and now cognitive impairment (your study). The results of these even are mixed, as the study mentions. All the other effects went away (my study). My point was that, for those effects, amphetamine therapeutic use ought to have even more benign outcomes. Either way, the cognitive impairment thus described is in methamphetamine abusers. No such effect, and in fact the opposite effect, has been shown in humans (acute healthy use and chronic ADHD use, as there are no healthy chronic use studies in humans I know of).</p>

<p>Um, it is easily separable. Episodic memory recall in a non-context dependent manner as in that study has nothing to do with episodic memory consolidation and then recall in a context-dependent manner. Recall of facts and your current working memory are related insofar as cognition and memory are related, but these processes are easily separable in cognitive psychology.

<p>And you&#39;re missing the point. While stimulants are known to improve some aspects of cognition, amphetamine fails because it&#39;s not neuroprotective and has side effects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it has side effects. Is it perfect? No, of course not. No one&#39;s claiming it is. however, does it show effect and is it tolerated in the majority of users? Yes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The improvement to some things with detriment to others doesn&#39;t help its case either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s personal risk vs. reward. You can be personally against it, and have the opinion that the benefits are not worth the risks; that&#39;s fine and I have no issue with that. I only have issue when you claim that there&#39;s no benefit in a context where it would not be expected to (i.e., non-context dependent settings), or use rat studies as undeniable evidence for an effect that hasn&#39;t been shown in humans. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more comedic, the fact that this was posted to psychiatry.com or the page-long list of funding disclosures. Additionally this study is fundamentally useless because it thinks it can depict the enhanced neurogenesis I described with a MRI, but again, it&#39;s malfunctioning. An MRI would not be capable of determining the difference.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither are comedic. If randombumfuck.com posts the results of a study they found on PubMed, does that make the study itself comedic? As for the funding thing, yeah... that is just the state of much research unfortunately. If you don&#39;t want to accept such research, then you have even less human data among the paucity already. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did cite it. Dude, are your stimulants already wearing off? Regardless, here it is again: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics%5C_that%5C_upregulate%5C_dopamine%5C_v20/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/q4s5pm/nootropics\_that\_upregulate\_dopamine\_v20/</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, avoid use of ad hominems when it has no relevance at all. It&#39;s pretty annoying. I was just referring to the fact that you could have linked the study you were referring to directly, instead of making the reader dig for it themselves when it&#39;s surrounded by many similar studies... It should always be clear what you&#39;re referencing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the exclusion criteria? Where are they ruling out dietary restrictions? Why do you still not understand that Tyrosine Hydroxylase is rate limited despite it being common knowledge that Tyrosine Hydroxylase upregulation underlies the neuropharmacological benefits of many drugs, and that L-Tyrosine has failed in many circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand it. And it is not as simple as you are saying. Tyrosine hydroxylase, like any enzyme, is rate-limiting when it is <em>saturated</em>. Do you have any evidence that it is saturated during these acutely stressful events. Do you have evidence that tyrosine can&#39;t interact with some upstream effector protein to alter the expression of TH? I don&#39;t; I haven&#39;t looked. But, because there are several studies that <em>do</em> show benefit, it is worth investigating <em>how</em> it might be causing such an effect. Just because it is rate-limited and saturated in normal conditions (when L-tyrosine shows no benefit), doesn&#39;t mean that alternate conditions (acute stress), in which <em>things aren&#39;t normal</em>, when it may indeed. You can&#39;t say that L-tyrosine has no effect and is &quot;likely not &#39;deficient&#39;,&quot; just like I can&#39;t say that that TH is saturated or not, for certain without some sort of evidence. We can only hypothesize based on existing data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you think you&#39;re doing the right thing with your persistent attempts to detract from my work (I know my stance is not public opinion due to years of misinformation), but the truth of the matter is that you&#39;re not right about this stuff and even worse you&#39;re rationalizing the use of amphetamine and methamphetamine and slowing the innovative process.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m doing this because there is some misinformation and misleading extrapolation of information. It&#39;s not about doing &quot;the right thing,&quot; I just don&#39;t like it. How am I &quot;persistently detracting&quot; from your work? This is the second or third post I&#39;ve commented on like this over the past year. We both have high affinities for argument; it&#39;s no surprise that those encounters get drawn out.</p>

<p>My goal is just to provide constructive/critical points and to get you and others here to stop saying and extrapolating things with such certainty. You can say, &quot;X has shown behavioral sensitization in humans. In rat models, this indicates addictive potential. In human models, the results are more mixed and there are opposing results of sensitization on addictive potential, but these are nonetheless risks that must be weighed.&quot; Basically, just to be more critical and cautious of your wording and to let readers form their own opinion from the data. You can highlight more than just your own points/beliefs/conclusions. People often accept any information as fact, especially if they look up to you, so I hope you consider it.</p>

I have been unable to get a refill for up to 1.5-2 weeks and the withdrawal never got any better.

    <div class="md"><p>A long time ago I was taking 60 mg of Adderall per day. Stopped taking it when laid off. Took it a few times a month for job interviews etc. Took my brain  and endocrine system 6 months to feel like my pre medicated self. I had only been on Adderall for 1.5 years by then. Don&#39;t know where you were at when unable to get a refill. But it sucked for me for the first 2 or 3 months I think. Tired, agitated. etc. I have ADHD but also convinced I have Sluggish Cognitive Tempo which has effects of sleepy during the day and brain being, well, sluggish. So anything that even minutely makes me sleepy I am hypersensitive to. And anything stimulating at night I am hypersensitive to.  So, my issues may or may not be worse than yours. If your endocrine system isn&#39;t also taking a hit, then that is better than I was. I&#39;m only surviving the shortage so far because I held onto meds when I was switching between so had so 10mg adderall from 2010 and a month and a half of 60 mg Adderall XR from 2009 or so. Taking Strattera that I have from 2018 which helps to need less Adderall.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting ready to switch to Modafinil if it works for me, with Strattera. You may look into that. People have mentioned that being on Modafinil or it&#39;s racemic twin Armodafinil with Adderall, they only needed a fraction of the adderall they would use without it. May try Adrafinil  which is related since i&#39;ve seen it on nootropic sites without a prescription.   </p>

<p>Ultimately I am on this thread to find out about upregulating my broken brain from Amphetamines so I can get onto a reasonable dose of Modafinil with Strattera and mitigate the withdrawal while trying to I don&#39;t lose my job.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Wait, what the hell am I talking about. You wrote this. You don&#39;t need my help. :P</p>

<p>Edit 3: Dude I&#39;m so inspired and grateful for this. Sounds like we came from similar situations. I&#39;ve written articles of similar depth but always tended to rely on amphetamines or other dopaminergics for the focus necessary to complete them.</p>

<p>Seeing that you&#39;re able to write something like this after repairing your dopamine system is inspiring. Especially since the two nootropics you honed in on are two of the only ones I haven&#39;t tried, and another two (agmatine and NAC) are two of the only ones I&#39;ve found to be effective.</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;d grown so wary of trying new noots that I probably wouldn&#39;t have ever gotten around to trying ALCAR or bromantane. But I&#39;m going to rehab next week and I&#39;m going to order some while I&#39;m there (the bromantane from you, if you ship to Canada!) so I can start fixing myself once I&#39;m back.</p>

Now I finally got my adderall script and find my tolerance is much higher which I expected, but was curious if anyone else has had a similar experience where basically all ur dopamine got used up in a day or two and stims stopped working lol. Also if there’s any tips on how to protect against any damage I did from that short use of meth and prevent any from a relatively low dose of adderall. </p>

<p>Thanks again for the info, sorry for the long comment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody said that L-carnitine has hypo-thyroidic mechanisms I think in Nootopics itself. Without any reference though, so this thing intrigues me now.  As then ALCAR by default, should do that too, but again there is no reference. Mayby not researched just. But if you have any proper research on this would be valuable as this topic may pop up every now and then. </p>

<p>But then again ALCAR does not FEEL very hypothyroidic, since the effect is so clearly only energising. Also there is no anecdotes basically what point into this direction with ALCAR no matter it is cheap and common supplement. Some people have reported wildly negative reactions but seemingly those have more to do acetylcholine overload when in combination with other cholinergics with ALCAR just enhancing those. Hypothyroid issues should manifest in gradually deepening laziness and weight gain and brain fog - when the effects are just opposite for nearly all users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Excess of these amino acids can not only decrease dopamine, but produce oxidative stress.\14]) &quot;</p>

<p>The study mentioned nothing about dopamine levels... what are you using to back your claim of Tyrosine administration causing decrease in dopamine?</p>

<p>And if you find oxidative stress problematic, why are you recommending a drug that increases TH activity? Increasing TH activity is known to cause oxidative stress... and if it truly has the ability to increase dopamine synthesis, it would also cause increased DOPAL buildup.</p>

<p>Bromantane is an antioxidant, anti inflammatory and increases neurotrophic growth factors including GDNF. All three of these things are protective against dopamine toxicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarification.</p>

<p>In your post, only study I have found was the During, Acworth and Wurtman one, which was mainly talking about Phenylalanine... its a good study, but due to the fact that it was done in rats, which have significantly different ability to convert Phenylalanine to Tyrosine, it is unjust to claim that excess of Tyrosine can decrease dopamine based on it.</p>

<p>And while mentioned qualities are protective against dopamine toxicity, since they are not quantified, and there has been no research done to measure relevant markers such as DNA/RNA damage, lipid peroxidation or DOPAL levels, I am struggling to see how you consider it as enough of an counter argument.</p>

<ol>
<li>They gave L-Tyrosine to people after eating a protein heavy meal and their dopamine decreased.</li>
<li>L-Tyrosine excess generates oxidative stress.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no counter argument. That&#39;s the truth. The studies are all there, feel free to re-read them as many times as you need to.</p>

<p>And in regards to Bromantane, I could say the same about your lazy remark about it generating oxidative stress. There are more mechanisms that would reduce oxidative stress, or the damage that it may cause, than to generate it. All with significant implications in literature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Coming a little late. </p>

<p>Can these supplements (agmatine, ALCAR, bromantane) cause insomnia or lead to another side effect if taken long term or at night? </p>

<p>Do they need to be cycled?</p>

<p>In another post you mentioned they aren&#39;t addictive, but what about withdrawal? Back then  you were hesitant to discontinue due to fear of depression coming back, so you didn&#39;t know. Do you know now? </p>

<p>Do these supplements interact with CBD/THC oil or any of the most popular herbs/adaptogens? </p>

<p>Do your recommended doses remain the same?
Agmantine 1g morning, 1g evening.
Alcar 1g morning. 
Bromantane 100mg. And why did you divide the agmantine dose in two?</p>
