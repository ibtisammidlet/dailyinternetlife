        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to take Fasoracetam after Phenibut to “decrease tolerance” and all it was doing was increasing anxiety, withdrawals and feeling like I was tripping whilst on it. This is when I was heavily addicted to phenibut and was never taken with phenibut at the same time.</p>

<p>I was told it would be social and mood boosting but it was completely the opposite at the time. </p>

<p>A few months clean from phenibut, I decided to give Fasoracetam another try and it feels amazing. It also changed in effects the more I use it. On week 1, the effects were primarily stimulating, it would help me clean the house and focus on tasks. From week 2 onwards, I’ve felt less stimulated and more relaxed, mood is elevated, an increased desire to socialise and I also feel light body euphoria very reminiscent of a light phenibut dose. </p>

<p>I have to say with it synergises well with Bromantane too. I have tried it both with and without it. With Bromantane, it feels stimulating and I get a little hyperactive. Without it, im more relaxed. They’re both good in their own ways.</p>

<p>I just want to ask what’s going on here. Why is it when I was addicted to phenibut, Fasoracetam sucked but after my addiction was over, it’s fantastic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t had much effect from bromantane. It probably because you had decreased gaba signaling and increased glutamate signaling when you went off phenibut, meaning at that point you had a disbalance towards glutamate signaling adding a racetame on top which is inherently modulates glutamate receptors and increases their activity only making, brain fog, anxiety and dissociative feeling more likely. Dosen&#39;t suprise me sounds like glutamatergic excitotoxictiy OR at least glutamatergic oversignaling (the tripping and increase in anxiety). Now that your natural gaba has recovvered your neurons can handle the increase in glutamate signaling better from the racetam. Do your research before doing any kind of substances. As you can see they can heavily fuck up your brain if you don&#39;t know how they work!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe your phenibut doses &amp; tolerance were very high, because fasoracetam is quite excitatory and can cause seizures at high doses by itself already. even if you were at baseline in the moment because you had enough phenibut in your system to prevent withdrawal, your brain&#39;s adaptations that give tolerance would still be able to potentiate excitatory shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. By the first, I have no more brainfog. My focus really improved, im more productive at work. Also computer games feel intense, because of the increased acetycholine. Music listening somehow better, even started singing to it in the work xD My mood is much better, more stable and on increased level(until you overdose, then it makes angry). It also improved my sleep. I do go bed with 10mg sublingual for better sleep, intense dreams which I do remember afer waking up. It is now two months since started therapy, and I think noopept will stay with me, as base of all stacks. Yesterday finished last oxiracetam dose, today first of coluracetam (5mg sublingual) and my mood and focus is even better!</p>

<p>I must also mention that since 7 years i had full abstinence of alcohol and any other drugs changing my brain chemistry, which could make results better.</p>

<p>Edit: forgot to mention that my speech quality increased. I use more words. My sentences are longer(sometimes too long) and more complex. My sense of humor is much better
I always liked situational (spontanic) jokes, now I do it even better, and people appreciate it.</p>
