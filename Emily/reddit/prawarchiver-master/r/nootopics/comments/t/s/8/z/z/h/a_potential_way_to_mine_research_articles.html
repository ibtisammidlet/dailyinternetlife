        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I&#39;ve recently gotten into learning a language. Reading up on recommend ways to learn a language, there&#39;s a concept known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">i+1</a>, or &#39;comprehensible input&#39;. Basically, the idea is that you learn most effectively when you understand everything in a sentence <em>except</em> one piece of vocabulary or grammar.<br/>
Now, there&#39;s this wonderful flashcard program out there called &#39;Anki&#39;. It&#39;s commonly used by medical students and language learners to memorize tens of thousands of pieces of information in a (overall) short amount of time. It utilizes <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> in order to quickly commit large amounts of information to long-term memory.</p>

<p>If you do the math, on average, you&#39;ll never spend more than thirty minutes total on any given card in order to memorize that information long-term. And by long-term, I mean years. Anki does this by trying to guess when you&#39;re just about to forget the card, and showing it to you then. Each time you see the card at that critical moment, it reinforces the memory in your brain, making it last even longer. </p>

<p>After a bit, the &#39;interval&#39; for a card will reach the length of months or years, meaning you won&#39;t see it again for a long time. This is how medical students can memorize thirty thousand facts with this program, and not be overwhelmed. Because, even if they have thirty thousand cards, most of those cards are going to end up with an interval of months or even years, leaving only maybe 100-200 reviews needed per day.</p>

<p>Okay, so this is where I finally get to the point. There&#39;s this wonderful article I read recently about how to use Anki to learn anything. <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Here&#39;s the link</a>. It&#39;s about a 20-30 minute read. I suggest you all take a look at it, because it&#39;s a stroke of pure genius. This guy talks about how he used Anki to build up an understanding of advanced fields of study that he has no background in (he writes news articles so he has to learn this stuff to report on it).<br/>
He would make cards on things he could understand from whatever book/study/lecture/etc., and slowly quiz himself to solidify that information. Then he would go back through, finding something he was now able to understand that he previously was not able to, and then make cards on those. It&#39;s i+1; comprehensible input. Doing this, he was able to understand the research paper written on Google&#39;s AlphaGo, despite not having any background in the field. If that doesn&#39;t quite make sense to you, just read the article and he explains it much better than I can.<br/>
If you read what he says, all this stuff seems very relevant to this community. I doubt anyone here would say they wouldn&#39;t like to have a better understanding of the science of nootropics. And this would only take a half hour to an hour of commitment each day to build up a better and more robust understanding.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you could commit to memory much more accurate information. Exact statistics, with the studies they come from included. An example he gave is this card: “What does Jones 2011 claim is the average age at which physics Nobelists made their prizewinning discovery, over 1980-2011?” (Answer: 48). This is information he has committed to long-term memory. It&#39;s very precise and specific, and he has done this for <em>thousands</em> of pieces of information. Again, I highly suggest you read the article, some of you may really like the idea. Let me know what you all think.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">6</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/The-Swiss-Chad.html">The-Swiss-Chad</a> 2022-03-30</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Alright so first I just want to say anki isnt bad it works. However I personally still think it is too slow to learn things. I think you can do it faster. This is how I personally learn things even faster then with anki.</p>

<p>So first what makes anki sub optimal:
For one yes anki is better then regular flasch cards I agree.</p>

<p>The issue is if your gonna study with anki *usually you will have to create your own flasch cards to have them personalised to what you need. This takes time and IMO is too long.</p>

<p>Ideally you do the following which speeds up the process and allows you to learn and remember things probably nearly as well as with anki, but much faster.</p>

<p>For concepts I suggest you use a simplified version of the fayman technique. Its pretty brilliant, but so simple. So usually when you learn something your consuming the information through a medium like a book, video or whatever. Right after you consumed a part of it (or something important was said) you quickly stop and you basicly ask yourself: What did I just read/watch/hear? (depending on how you consumed it) Then you will have to repeat and reexplain the concepts in your own words in your head, this process imediately internalizes the information and allows you to recall it much easier then if you wouldnt have done that during reading. Its very powerful since you can also work with visualisation if your memory is more visual like in my case. Its also super fast.</p>

<p>(Important note to this technique at the end)</p>

<p>For vocabulary, facts and dates
Mnemonics combined with a memory palace IMO is the easiest way of learning vocab or numbers.  I think the guy in the article also mentioned heres just a quick overview of when and how I use it. I generally only use this technique for very difficult vocab usually the simplified fayman technique is enough.</p>

<p>Example word baobab
Medical Definition of baobab</p>

<p>: a broad-trunked Old World tropical tree (Adansonia digitata) of the silk-cotton family (Bombacaceae) with an edible acid fruit resembling a gourd, leaves and bark formerly used medicinally, and bark that is used in making paper, cloth, and rope</p>

<p>So if I wanted to remember this I say the world out loud in my head and see what the sound reminds me of in this case the word that comes in mind for me is boar. It sounds  similar to baobab imo. So the meaning is a tropical tree and the name for it sounds like boar. So I imagine a tropical tree growing from my ceiling with a boar hanging from it. Make the image absurd the more absurd the easier to remember. Now I just need to think of my room. What do I see? A boar hanging from a tropical tree which is attached to my ceiling. So I know the meaning is the topical tree and the name is going to be something that sounds like boar. The closer the word is the better to the thing you decided to take as your mnemonic the better. This train of thought allows you to sort of plant lots of hints within your brain to get to the word and thereby remember by not really actually remembering the word. </p>

<p>But like I said the simplified fayman technique usually is enough. If...</p>

<p>Important: You should use noots that improve LTP and or memory directly. Thats very important. You need to have this otherwise you will struggle memorising things just by reviewing them once with fayman, but it works if you pay attention and actively try to memorise what you just consumed when you use the fayman technique with noots.</p>

<p>As you can see generally faster then anki. For people that still struggle even though they use these technqiues anki might be better.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Also may I just point out I read the fayman technique over a year ago and I overtime forgot the name but remembered the technique. I just now when writing this I tried to figureout the name again and at first I came to freeman which was wrong and then to frayman. I read this in a article over 1 year ago! I fucking love noots. Allowed me to remember this by simply thinking back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say, in the article it was said that the cards he uses are just really simple front and back cards. That&#39;s what I do and it doesn&#39;t take more than a few moments. Also, I&#39;ve been considering combining the feynman technique with Anki in order to get the best of both worlds: periodic reminding to reduce memory decay, and comprehensive internalization. What noots do you take for LTP? I&#39;m on Lion&#39;s mane and Synapsa (Bacopa Monnieri).</p>
