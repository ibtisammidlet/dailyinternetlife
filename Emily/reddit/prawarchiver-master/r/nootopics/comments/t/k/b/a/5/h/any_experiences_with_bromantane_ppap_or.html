<p>Whilst my productivity has indeed gone up, I‚Äôm wondering if I can enhance it any further with nootropics. I‚Äôve already tried Modafinil and Armodafinil, and whilst they are certainly effective, the benefit is modest only.</p>

<p>Out of all the remaining nootropics: PPAP, Bromantane and Phenylpiracetam appear to be the only ones that elevate dopamine. And they appear to do this through novel and unique mechanisms.</p>

<p>Before I part with my hard-earned cash, can anyone vouch for any of these? What was your experience like? And what dosage were you on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all be careful and start low when combining any of these with methylphenidate. It can be risky. PPAP is also a kind of a releaser (a classical releaser like amphetamine you dont want to combine with a reuptake inhibitor like methylphenidate) but anyway its not the same, PPAP is not a releaser in the classical sense so doesnt seem to have this problem in my eperience (taken close to 75g total btw - one of my favs and highly effective!). The combo seems beneficial and synergistic. More on that later. </p>

<p>Yes thorough experince with all three for exactly what you want with it and even combining PPAP with a DRI like methylphenidate (Im taking 4f-mph, a methylphenidate analog, its not as good as methylphenidate IMO). i would also like to raise your attention to another you may have disregarded, tianeptine sulphate, which I have found potentiates and synergizes so extremely well with 4f-methylphenidate that if you take a strong dose you just feel like shit because its too much. More on that later.</p>

<p>Phenylpiracetam I can certainly vouch for. It got me through some hard times. Ive been through most of life with pretty bad ADHD that is unmedicated. Im depressed and crazy social anxiety. Anyway, phenylpiracetam is the second most mild perhaps and the most researched of the three. It is not overly stimulating, in doses of 50-100mg it gives you a boost and helps you stay focused, alert, and perform better. Doses of 100-200mg are more stimulating and probably as high as I would go when combining. I used to take 200-300mg by itself when I was taking it every day for a long time. Thats a really high dose for most I think but it seemed to be losing effectiveness with me. </p>

<p>PPAP. Truly one of my most favourite of all the hundreds of compounds ive tried (I have thought about posting a list but it sounds too braggy) to improve cognition and memory, manage ADHD, etc. It is highly potent, 10-15mg is my typical dose with or without methylphenidate, but I have taken up to 25-35mg with my dose of 4f-methylphenidate without issues. It greatly enhances focus, and improves motivation by increasing the reward you feel completing tasks. Its a very powerful tool in our circumstances. Its also one of the only &quot;stimulants&quot; I can take and fall asleep anytime after it kicks in. It doesnt stimulate all the time, so if your doing nothing you dont really notice it, but when you do anything, I dont know how to explain it exactly, but that activity is enhanced. Focus is greatly enhanced. Anything you enjoy, you will enjoy it more on PPAP, the more you enjoy it normally, the greater the increase in enjoyment you will experience. Activities like intense gaming are so much more intense and enjoyable with no negative performance effects. </p>

<p>Can increase anxiety, especially at doses higher than 10-15mg.</p>

<p>Can also lead to getting locked into a task not really willing to break your concentration or overdoing a topic in a convo, stuff like that. Can also lead to higher emotional volatility by increasing the amount of anger or other emotions you feel when something upsets you. Contributed to a huge fight once in a completely inappropriate setting once between my father and I, by amplifying the negative feelings I had when he did something that wouldve bothered me a lot without the PPAP. Just gotta keep these in mind (especially getting too much in the zone as people with ADHD - thats a symptom of our affliction and sometimes stims like methylphenidate can make that worse) and dont get sucked in, the feeling passes quickly if your aware its being amplified (focus or emotions) and dont let it take over.</p>

<p>I have also taken higher doses of it alone and with other things, around 50-75mg, but ive noticed lately a dose above 35mgish gives a headache and not much more postive effects than a lower dose. Stck to below 50mg I think.</p>

<p>I used to game semicompetitively and take high doses of PPAP, about 100mg and sometimes up to 200mg. I had never felt so focused and so deeply into the game, never been so undistracted as I was during these sessions. I have never felt so much enjoyment from video games as I did here. It created hardcore 4-8 hour gaming sessions that were so much fun. Kinda wore out the effectiveness and especially the pleasure increase for me so moderation is big with this one. It could potentially lead to a problem if you abuse it. </p>

<p>I tried a lot of bromantane, didnt feel a thing, might be a non-responder but only took it orally. Never combined with DRI like methylphenidate. Combined with other stims though maybe that was the problem...  Need more testing I think. </p>

<p>Another you should consider is tianeptine suplhate. It is long acting and absorbs slowly, taking about 2hrs max to fully kick in and lasting for 4-6 hours after roughly. Regular dose for antidepressant/anti anxiety is 40mg. I woiuld reccomend starting with only 10-15mg and giving it 4 hours to feel it and go from there. By itself I took 40-80mg. Combined with 4f-mph, my dose depends on how long ago I took the stimulant. Taking it at the same time as the tianeptine, I take maybe 15mg. Since im using 4f-mph for adhd management, I take 10-15mg in the morning and slightly less once again at noon. It lasts over 12 hours but the strongest effects and the most positive effects start dropping off 4-6ish hours after it kicks in. It last at least 12 hours though, enough that you cant sleep before 2am if you take some at 2pm. Therefore, usually the evening, having take 10mg of stimulant at or before noon I take iiia 25-35mg does of tianeptine, taking this brings back the stimulation and positive effects of the stim (after about 2 houra)takign meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to help. My advice: start with phenylpiracetam. Easiest to get, probably the cheapest, and while we can&#39;t say it&#39;s the safest of the three its perhaps the one you can feel most confident in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not studied enough in humans to be sure, like most compounds in nootropics/resear chemicals.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not safe, it means we need several large studies to establish a drugs safety, but no one is willing to sacrifice billions run them.</p>

<p>It only happens with new pharmaceuticals because the pharma company that invented them is looking for a new medication, is heavily invested in the chems and while usually costing billions or trillions to develop a new drug, the company hopes to earn more than that to once they receive approval for sale.</p>

<p>Noots and research chems are like public domain, no pharma company is really that interested in them sadly...</p>

<p>That said, I have never had issues and have been taking it for 5-6 years on and off I think. Not sufficient enough to say &quot;yes it&#39;s safe, don&#39;t worry&quot; but it&#39;s at least proof you won&#39;t die from taking it responsibly.</p>

<p>Hell, I used to abuse it and take waaaay too much but I&#39;ve stopped that now and it had no noticable negative effects on me aside from a kind of general fogginess the first couple days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PPAP is not a releaser of any form. It‚Äôs an activity enhancer. It creates a sort of chain reaction ‚Äúping‚Äù effect that activates more dopamine receptors during dopamine releasing activity (or combined with other compounds). The entire point of its existence is to create a dopaminergic stim thats not at all a releaser lol</p>

<p>It‚Äôs like Selegaline but reduced down to just that one of its base core functions. Zero amphetamine conversation, zero releaser activity, and zero MAO-B inhibiting properties. Fascinating stuff!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have combined it with both phenibut and f-phenibut with no negative reactions, definitely helped alleviate any anxiety increases from PPAP</p>

<p>I have never set out to test and experiment with the combo on its own to get good quality experiential data </p>

<p>I did not combine them for long enough periods to have much more to say about it.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s safe I can not say, I can&#39;t even really say whether it&#39;s a worthwhile combination or not but drawing from my experience with other compounds that are indirect/downstream dopamine releasers, I would wager that PPAP will potentiate the downstream dopamine release caused by phenibut </p>

<p>Meaning I believe the effects of both will be potentiated by the combo and you would need lower doses of both for the same effects</p>

<p>Take it with a grain of salt because I do not have extensive experience with the PPAP/phenibut or PPAP/f-phenibut combo, as I mentioned.</p>

<p>What experience I do have, I do not recall specifics and they were probably stacked with other noots which may confound my  results. All I recall specifically is no negative reactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he most certainly should NOT consider taking Tianeptine sulfate ü§£ Ik I‚Äôm biased as hell because I associate it with high, opioid activity doses and (most of all) HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL!!! But I just don‚Äôt think it should be promoted as something safer than stuff like PPAP/Bromantane.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the difference between those for me. PPAP and Bromantane haven‚Äôt once caused me catastrophic withdrawals or rebound of any sort. And I know I know, you can use Tia completely different in low doses. However it‚Äôs STILL an ssri! That‚Äôs nothing to take lightly lol SSRI‚Äôs have shitty withdrawals too and many more potential side effects.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd go with PPAP over Tia ANY DAY after my experiences with both opioids AND ssris‚Ä¶</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bromantane and PPAP both have mechanisms which allow them to have reduced neurotoxicity and tolerance. MPH and amph directly increase extracellular dopamine, in comparison bromantane and PPAP more or less proportionally increase how much can be released in response to neuronal neurotransmission. Basal dopamine levels are less affected  </p>

<p>I would also like to say though, it appears the hyperactivity element of ADHD might benefit from the decreased variability in dopamine. either way, it depends on the user.   </p>

<p>i vouch for bromantane, PPAP, selegiline &amp; alcar in terms of consistency. Modafinil and MPH have been consistent for me but only in a low dose with the right stack. everything here potentiates everything else and i can use low doses.  </p>

<p>phenylpiracetam is cool with modafinil, achieves something unique in my experience. but tolerance is an issue</p>

<p>reduced tonic (you can think of it as baseline/resting) dopamine, and enhanced phasic release of dopamine (happens on the scale of milliseconds) is already a finding in ADHD  </p>

<p><strong>Synaptic DA transmission</strong> section  </p>

<p>Grace has pointed out that by interfering with dopamine re-uptake, stimulants allow dopamine to escape the synaptic cleft, thereby <strong>depressing subsequent spike-dependent phasic dopamine release by increasing the tonic stimulation of the auto-receptor</strong>. Thus subcortical down-regulation depends on presynaptic auto-inhibition through autoreceptors. This mechanism is similar to that proposed by Seeman and Madras, who pointed out that stimulants raise extracellular levels of dopamine several-fold, but <strong>reduce the extent to which dopamine is released with nerve impulses</strong>, compared with the impulse-associated release in the absence of the drug. However at higher doses, stimulants are found to produce generalised stimulation of the nervous system, as a result of very high concentrations of extracellular dopamine at rest, and markedly increased release of dopamine with nerve impulses overcoming presynaptic inhibition of dopamine release  </p>

<p>So essentially a popular theory is that it&#39;s not only more dopamine that helps ADHD, but more consistent dopamine levels promoting less variable behavior you could say.</p>

<p>Apparently it&#39;s non-addictive too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to help. My advice: start with phenylpiracetam. Easiest to get, probably the cheapest, and while we can&#39;t say it&#39;s the safest of the three its perhaps the one you can feel most confident in</p>
