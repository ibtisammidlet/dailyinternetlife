        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>So I don&#39;t need tips on my medication; taking Vyvanse for ADD has been amazing for my focus, productivity, mood, general wellbeing. So no desire to change that.</em></p>

<p>Only problem is, it&#39;s killed the &quot;bodily energy&quot; I used to have in my body. Best way I can describe it is that I have lost the pent up &quot;buzz&quot; in my body in terms of that physical urge to be active and instead feel a kind of zen vibe; like very relaxed and content and still.</p>

<ul>
<li>Before meds I would workout after work in the late afternoon, whereas now on meds I find I struggle to find the right kind of energy/motivation to go workout.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve tried a few supplements/nootropics (Vitamin B, Tyrosine, Matcha, Preworkouts with some L-Theanine, DHA, COQ10, Creatine) and at best they&#39;ve just extended the duration of the calm relaxed focused vibe of my medication (which is great but not the kind of boost I need to go workout).</li>
<li>Cholinergics I&#39;ve tried (Alpha GPC, Ginkgo, Ginseng, Bacopa) have just made me tired and have been no help at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I&#39;m looking for supplements that will give me a workout specific energy; a physical energy boost that will give me that &quot;yeah let&#39;s go workout and lift heavy things&quot; kind of vibe rather than a deep focus energy.</p>

<p>But also something that won&#39;t jack up my heart rate (e.g. too much caffeine without L-Theanine) as that also stops me being able to workout for being too heightened and jittery (seems to synergise with Vyvanse)</p>

<p>Diet is fine, ample daily protein, recent blood test results were all fine in terms of all major vitamins (especially Mg/Zn), testosterone, TSH, etc.</p>

<p>I know but what <em>type</em> of caffeine though? Because I&#39;ve tried various different types and have found they do different things; e.g. some like Matcha just extend the mellow focused feeling/duration of my meds, whereas things like coffee and white tea made me too heightened and jittery, whereas things like Yerba Mate gave me the right kind of energy but way too fast and made me very irritable too.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried ALCAR and possibly Agmatine sulfate as part of pre-workouts but never separately. I do have some ALCAR on hand but have been putting off trying it since all the other Cholinergics have just made me tired.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Been on Vyvanse about 1.5 years now, was on short-acting Dex a for a year before that. Built up to 70mg last year (was on that for 4 months, too high!) then came down to 65mg around January which I&#39;ve stayed at since. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only taken two singular days off (not in succession) since starting it. </p>

<p>Reason I don&#39;t take days off more often is because I notice that when I do take a day off, then that day is just a complete write-off because I just end up sleeping all day (withdrawal symptoms?). I don&#39;t go back to my normal unmedicated self on a day off meds, just a wiped out drowsy state.   </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I was on Ritalin first and it led to disastrous results for me, even at small doses.</p>

<p>Amphetamines have been much better for me, might be worth a shot for you? Or maybe a non stimulant med?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, let me elaborate on that.</p>

<p>By the time I finish work at the end of the day, that&#39;s when I start to wind down in terms of the positive effects of Vyvanse and so am looking for the right kind of thing to perk me back up again.</p>

<p>This is because when the meds start wearing off, I start becoming depressed, spacey, feel like I have no soul. When this happens I have no motivation to do anything, whether productive or fun. This is also the state I&#39;m often in the following morning before taking my next day&#39;s Vyvanse dose (which is why AM workouts would not work).  </p>

<p>Interesting, I&#39;ll look into that.</p>

<p>When would I be looking to take that? As Vyvanse is wearing off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the additional info. </p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking you&#39;d take forskolin an hour before wind down. It works pretty quickly, so, you&#39;d know in a few days if it&#39;s going to help. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could take the vyvanse later in the day, so when you finish working, you still have the energy/motivation, or a dex booster, later in the day.</p>

<p>You could also cycle bromantane with vyvanse, 3 days on bromantane and 4 days on vyvanse, it helps lower tolerance aswell as extend the duration of effects of vyvanse, I take 30mg dex for my adhd and cycle it like this, it definitely works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to comment on the blood test results. It is thought that magnesium deficiency won&#39;t easily show up on a serum test as it&#39;s released from cells in response to stress or even bones.</p>

<p>In chronic magnesium deficiency, serum magnesium levels are often within the normal reference range (<em>usually</em> lowest quartile) and may not progress to overt hypomagnesaemia.</p>
