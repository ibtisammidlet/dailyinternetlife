        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m experimenting with cerium nanoparticles which are SOD and catalase mimetics. They are also rechargeable and basically work like artificial antioxidant enzymes (nanozymes).</p>

<p>I have an initial batch of simple cerium nanoparticles arriving next week, size 2-7nm, not conjugated with anything. Their zeta potential is negative, so they won’t permeate into mitochondria. By default, shouldn’t pass through the blood-brain barrier as well, unless mine is leaky somewhere.</p>

<p>I’m looking for any compounds that could temporarily and reversibly open up my BBB so that they could have a chance to get in. The safety and accessibility of the method are a priority. </p>

<p>I haven’t started analyzing literature about such a method but thought to ask if anybody would know anything interesting already.</p>

<p>EDIT:
since I have depression, I may already have BBB hyperpermeability: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220803/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4220803/</a> however, I shouldn&#39;t assume such a thing and still need to find some manual intervention to open it up.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no way to &quot;safely&quot; get untested nanoparticles into your brain. What is the goal even? The benefit is unclear and the potential harms are significant. Antioxidants aren&#39;t universally &quot;good&quot; for you either, redox processes are crucial for immune defense against pathogens and malignancy. Animal studies of some high dose antioxidants have shown increases in risk for some cancers. So I&#39;m not sure if the primary mechanism of what you&#39;re trying to do will have a net benefit or harm, and additionally, there is serious potential for unintended harms and off-target effects if you damage the blood brain barrier and try to mess with the brain parenchyma and immune system</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are biocompatible nanoparticles that were even tested in humans. The goal is to suppress microglial activation, neuroinflammation, lipid peroxidation, ROS damage etc that’s shown to occur in depression, anything brain related. I’ve analysed the literature and came to this transient bbb permeability enhancement stack: high dose ginkgo, borneol, tdcs, loud music, cbd (or other a2a agonist). Other interventions are not realistic enough to consider, e.g not going to do on myself intracarotid injection to the neck of mannitol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re way out on a limb here, and online communities like this can sometimes be dangerous echo chambers when it comes to self medication. I looked at your profile and if you aren&#39;t trolling you seem highly invested in some goals of self medication/biohacking/experimentation with novel compounds that you are hoping will help your mental health. You seem curious and intelligent but are seriously underestimating your risk of harming yourself. Why not seek out professional help and conventional therapies? Self medication and self experimentation can become a form of self harm. You might want to take a step back and look for perspective here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The professional help that you can get from today’s average professionals is not professional enough. They have no idea about microglial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, damage due to inability to cope with ROS (all shown to play a causative role in depression and anything brain related), and even if they do, they have no tools (drugs) to even influence that. There is no point for them to even be following new studies in the area as they are only prescribers and there is no drug to prescribe to treat e.g mitochondrial dysfunction in depression (which doesn’t mean such a molecule or intervention doesn’t exist). In this day, I believe I either help myself myself or no help will be gotten. Here I’m not looking to debate that. Check your DMs. Send me please a list of studies to suggest why I’d not want to antioxidate my brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my notes, you need 5g of a standard 24% extract, to replicate the study I found. It’s a lot of ginkgo. Many supps are 2% or so, and give like 50mg per capsule. Found terravita has a powder product</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me check what mine was. It was from bulk supplements. Can you send me a PM and remind me. I have the most severe case of Anhedonia and TRMDD due to a neurometabolic condition and low enzyme activity. The fact I felt anything for two weeks speaks to its power. I remember nausea being a factor at that dose.  It also made me attracted to mermaids that have always been repulsive… why idk</p>
