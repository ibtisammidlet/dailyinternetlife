<p>Does it even make sense since piracetam works primarly by facilitating better glucose uptake into neurons and since being on keto I get majority of brain energy from ketones not glucose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this thought just the other day. </p>

<p>Neural cells still expect 25% of their energy from glucose (other from ketones) when fully keto adapted. It does seem piracetam&#39;s enhancement in neural glucose oxidation (measured by glucose metabolites) - I would of thought perhaps its more of an increase energy oxidation (not just glucose), but it may not be the case and may be specific to glucose oxidation. In that case it could lead to be an oxymoron in that specific mechanism of Piracetam. </p>

<p>Regardless, being on ketogenic diet, keto adapted. You wouldnt need any nootropics - from personal experience, the brain is in such an optimised state that nootropics lead to anxiety (due to bell shaped curve of enhanced neural activity) </p>

<p>If you have ever gotten your blood ketones to 3mmol, you know exactly how &#39;meth&#39; like the experience is, especially when you have a 30ml shot of MCT oil.</p>

<p>Also, drugs in general work different on a ketogenic adapted biology. The utilisation of ketones changes the fundamental activity of the body (through modulation of GABA and NMDA).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you get blood levels to 3mmol purely on keto diet or do you need to add fasting for 2-3 days? I&#39;m starting on keto diet and want to get keto adapted to potentially drop modafinil from my bupropion, vortioxetine, modafinil stack I take bunch of other noots (hup a, cycling racetams,
ginkgo, saffron, alcar) since starting a keto I need to make a selection and evaluate which one are actually relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can get up to 5-7mmol on keto diet without anything else.. even if you drink 30ml of coconut oil will get you high up whilst on a keto diet.</p>

<p>Not sure why you would fast like that for that purpose in this situation. I get the point but on a ketogenic diet it mimics the state of fasting, atleast from an insulin concentration point of view.</p>

<p>Plus the dietary fat is easier to convert to ketones than it for lipolysis of adipose tissue.</p>

<p>It will take 3-4 weeks strict for the flip to switch. First 3 weeks you need approx 150g of protein per day (no exercise), after you can do well on 50-100g, exercise or no exercise.</p>

<p>I always encourage a 36hour water fast between going from mixed diet to keto as a way to rapidly deplete glycogen stores and Induce the hunger suppressing hormone in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is it necessary to eat a lot of fats, or is eating a low-carb diet sufficient?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends if you are obese. Higher body fat means more surface area for Metabolism. Which means more fatty acids can be released. Leaner you get, it becomes less, which means you need to accommodate the difference through dietary fat.</p>

<p>Ketosis it self isn&#39;t an issue to enter in. The Keto adaption takes minimum 21 days. First 21 days you should consume 150g protein per day. Then you can drop it to 50g if you want.</p>

<p>If you are doing keto, you shouldn&#39;t think about how much carbs you can get away with. At this stage you better off just cutting it out in full and just count what comes from nuts and seeds.</p>

<p>The feeling of ketoadaption is pronounced and is like off on switch.</p>

<p>You need a blood ketone meter. It&#39;s literally only $20</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is that much protein necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. brain uses same amount of energy 247 (slightly less during sleep) regardless of mental effort. </p>

<p>Brain needs approximately 600 calories in a 24 hr period.
600 calories in protein is 150g.
The brain can derive 75% of its energy from ketones only after keto adaptation. Prior, 75% comes from glucose even if it means to convert stored or dietary protein to acquire it.</p>

<p>under starvation (low insulin/keto/fasting/under eating) the body can convert upto 58% of Protein into glucose.</p>

<p>if 75% of 600 calories needs to be glucose energy the first 21 days then you can do the math yourself. I believe ketone energy is 4 calories per gram same as glucose and protein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. Need to look it up. An optimized, or a reved up, brain, should use up more glucose though. So in that sense most noots should do that. I&#39;m not to familiar with brain glucose utilisation mechanics though, so can&#39;t be too smart about it ... I know that piracetam did not help my post prandial brain fog, caused probably, by unresponsible rhGH use. Nicergoline, however, completely abolished it. But that has an effect on insulin secretion, due to it&#39;s alpha 2a agonist features ...</p>
