As you can see in this website they are not at the top of income or education expenditure per inhabitant so I don&#39;t think those are the main causes. I was thinking maybe it is because they consume lots of fish which provides DHA. I also read that obesity is less prevalent among Asians. What do you think? Can it be something about their diet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to start out by saying I don&#39;t believe China&#39;s statistics. They are known to skew national statistics and I heard they collected this data from colleges which would alter the results.</p>

<p>Japan&#39;s on the other hand I do believe. They&#39;re a wealthy country that has good education and eats a lot of fish. Their brains are given all they need to fully develop. The same can be said about South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.</p>

<p>But keep in mind Asia is definitely not all high IQ. Look at the Philippines or Nepal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the answer is more to be found in emphasis on education rather than nutrition. IQ tests certainly aren&#39;t some perfect test of one&#39;s inherent, genetic ability to learn &amp; perceive that eliminates any influence of prior learning experience. There are plenty of data suggesting that average IQ scores improve with level of education within a society.  </p>

<p>In terms of nutrition, yes obesity is less prevalent in Asian countries, because of our lifestyles and the things we eat. However, with globalization and growth in income levels, this has become less so, and obesity in many asian countries is on the rise. (Although we&#39;ve got ways to go.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a trait that varies between species, could provide any conceivable advantage or be affected by selective pressures, and is dependent on the functioning of most complex biological structure known. Those kinds of things never have anything to do with genes.</p>

<p>We just need to throw more money at people who decided to get educated in education and make being talked at by them a full-time job for everyone up to the age of 18 at least. After a century of this, we have a society of geniuses. It&#39;s a marvel.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more practically, a society could easily achieve cognitive equity by dosing the smarter children with lead and beating them for thinking anything different than the others. I daresay we could even remove the frontal lobe at birth. So long as these children are properly educated about their true identity as cognitively normal yet unbrained people, they should turn out to be quite functional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the extent of your research on &quot;smartness&quot; is googling IQ by country then you have a lot of work to do with your research questions and data collection methodology before you even remotely get to any hypotheses about fish consumption.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s genetic. It goes way deeper than more commonly ingesting a few chemicals than other races. It&#39;s most likely an incredibly multifaceted evolutionary process. But this is stepping into controversial territory because apparently genes can cause a multitude of different traits in different people except for intelligence.</p>
