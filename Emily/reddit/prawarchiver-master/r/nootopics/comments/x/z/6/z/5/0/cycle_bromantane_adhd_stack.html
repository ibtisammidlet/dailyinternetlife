    <div class="md"><p>I tried it all for ADHD. I mean so many damn stacks. Including Bromantane. Unfortunately you need an actual drug stimulant stack for real gains. Pemoline is the best for this but basically very hard to come by. So best bet is itâ€™s relative compounds or standard ADHD medication stimulants. With some other stuff to counter side affects, down regulation, and to further enhance it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be on methylphenidate (Concerta/Ritalin) but the psychiatrist prescribing me retired and due to the absolute shitshow that is the healthcare system in my country, I have to sit through a three year waiting list before I am able to get a new one and continue getting prescribed it. Bromantane actually works very well for me, it&#39;s the best alternative I&#39;ve tried by far and works almost as well as methylphenidate did. Doesn&#39;t help my focus quite as much but it does have the big bonus of helping with anxiety, depression, and motivation which methylphenidate doesn&#39;t.</p>

I have tried 50mg and it had no noticeable effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take 50-75mg every morning. Genuinely the best nootropic I have ever tried. If you got no results at 50mg then I&#39;d try a higher dose. Try upping it to 75mg and then 100mg and then 150mg if that doesn&#39;t work. According to the original manufacturer up to 200mg is safe and well tolerated. Ideal dosage seems to vary a lot per person with bromantane. I&#39;ve heard of people getting strong results from 25mg but that does nothing for me. </p>

<p>Also did you take it for more than one day? For some people it can a week or two until they start getting noticeable effects.</p>

<p>Do you take it with anything else?
Either at the same time or as part of your daily routine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The supplements I take every day are just a multivitamin, green tea extract, and AAKG every morning but those don&#39;t really have any nootropic effects. </p>

<p>I do often take polygala with bromantane though as I find it synergizes really well with it and potentiates the mood lifting and stimulant effects. I take usually around 150-250mg of polygala at a time (most people only need 100mg for effects from it though, I&#39;m just less sensitive to it) and it works nicely. I also sometimes take some phenibut (around 500mg or so) in the morning as it works well with bromantane and polygala in my experience and I do that a couple of times a week for socializing as phenibut helps with social anxiety and social ability for me.</p>

<p>You have experience with pemoline and found it more useful than, like, adderall? That&#39;s interesting to me because many people therorize that the &quot;push&quot; from norepinephrine is an important part of the adderall, not just the dopamine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used pemoline before and it&#39;s definitely not as effective as Adderall but barely has any side effects which is nice. It lacks the &quot;get up and go&quot; feeling and if I took it before I went to work I&#39;d definitely do more work but if I took it when I was sitting at my house then literally nothing would happen. My favorite part of pemoline was that it didn&#39;t effect my personality, didn&#39;t cause me to become robotic and numb like literally every other ADHD stimulant does to me which is why I stopped taking them</p>
