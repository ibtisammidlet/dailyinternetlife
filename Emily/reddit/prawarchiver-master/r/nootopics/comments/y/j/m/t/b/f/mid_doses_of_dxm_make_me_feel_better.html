        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been modulating my dopamine for a while, with substances such as ALCAR uridine bromantane, Cordyceps, low dose aspirin, and all the support minerals and noots that go along with them.</p>

<p>I had reached a point where my new normal was lower, and I new I needed a reset. I forced myself off caffeine and anything dopamine related (I would occasionally use things like Kratom/ sabroxy for the push to dopamine, but always cycled and I never developed a tolerance to any single substance)</p>

<p>I began dosing upper normal ranges of dxm for its affects on NMDA, around 100-140mg at night or sometimes I’d move that night dose to mid day.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing around with it, and I never feel high or anything but I just feel <em>better</em></p>

<p>More in tune with my senses, more grounded, more <em>real</em> and when I had cycled off everything for several weeks, I caught myself greatly enjoying life again. Laughing at minute things, belly laughing and enjoying things. </p>

<p>It took some getting used too, as my energy output took a hit. Mind you I felt terrible for a couple days from caffeine withdrawal and just not having that “thing” to push me through my more intense work.</p>

<p>2 months later, I’m back to some nootropics and hitting plateaus performance wise again, and when I dosed I again notice dxm always levels me out.. gives me more passion for life and improves my mood on top of adding this <em>realness</em> to my perception.</p>

<p>I believe I don’t have the typical neurochemistry already from some past things however, what could be causing dxm to be therapeutic to me? Purely just clearing those receptors of calcium influx, etc?</p>

<p>How long could this go on without being problematic? I know of lesions in mice models, however I believe that was at 4-5 times my dose (human equivalent)</p>

<p>Could I perhaps need a longer flush/ abstaining from dopamine release and clearing out NMDA?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you lower your dose to 90mg a day you can at least know that your dose is the same as an FDA approved drug (45mg twice a day as prescribed in combination with bupropion) if that has any value to you from a safety standpoint.  In fact bupropion slows the metabolism of DXM so it is somewhat comparable to taking a higher dose. To what specific degree is difficult to say, but I think this a reasonably safe treatment option as long as as you are aware of the potential for interactions with other medications. Particularly as it concerns serotonin syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’m prescribed 150mg buproprion and 30mg dxm twice per day and i feel reborn. i’ve struggled with major depression, severe generalized and social anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder the majority of my life. tried every antidepressant you can think of, including wellbutrin on its own and i only ever saw really mild reduction in symptoms or just straight up nothing. i’ve only been on it 3 weeks but holy fuck i feel like my true self again. no cravings to abuse substances, total executive function, positive mood, and lots of energy but not too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love taking dxm here and there. It does more than just mess with NDMA. I take 90 mg here and there and it really turns me into a kid again. Just happy, full of wonder, belly laughing at simple things. I’ve tried other dissociative drugs and they help but not to the extend as dxm does. I’ve been messing with it for 18 years. Tripped on it a lot in my younger years and always cherished the afterglow more than the high. The last ten years I’ve only ever taken up to 90mg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I know the dosage is slightly higher than upper tolerable limit for steady dosing,
However I do not notice the antagonistic reducing effects until I break 100mg,</p>

<p>Ie after a week or two of dosing and abstaining from substances, at even 90mg I hardly notice a benefit when caffeine or others are reintroduced,</p>

<p>But even 120mg daily will offer benefit.</p>

<p>I have abused dxm as an adolescent, and I’m not quite sure if that could of gave me permatolerance.
-actually I’m not quite sure if that’s possible as it pertains purely to its mechanism on the NMDA that I’m using it for</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are responder to dxm you may look into memantine, amantadine and ha-966. The third one especially has profound and rapid motivational and activating effect but tolerance develops unbelievably fast. Amantadine works quite rapidly too. Memantine takes time and patience but is very reliable. Also you may mix dxm with bupropion for longer and stronger effect. This combination of medicines is currently investigated for the rapid treatment of depression under asx-05 name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me memantine has pretty bad side effects. Horrible insomnia and I even notice this like jittery anxiousness.</p>

<p>Dxm is the only of its kind I have responded well that I’ve tried.</p>

<p>I don’t notice much for agmatines antagonistic effects or magnesium (both obviously leagues weaker in effect)</p>

<p>The other substances you mentioned seem intriguing, I may look further into them.</p>

<p>My question for the ha-966 is if tolerance develops rapidly,</p>

<p>Does this have other downstream effects? Is it just tolerance to specifically that substance, or the aspect of antagonizing the NMDA receptor?</p>

<p>If so, I’d believe I wouldn’t like to risk it as I like to go on breaks from anything that pushes dopamine and just take an antagonist to clear things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lesions for sure occur in humans after a certain amount of abuse(probably not a worry for you unless you develop a habit). Ndma antagonism in general feels really good to many people. The drop in glutamate is what you are considering therapeutic. </p>

<p>You’re using it as a recreational drug IMO, just not quite tripping. I used to do the same thing; use it in a way similar to weed, but it usually spirals out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s complicated.</p>

<p>“Mechanistically, antagonist-mediated blocking of NMDA receptor (hypofunctioning) leads to the excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate and acetylcholine) in different brain regions, which in turn causes hyperstimulation of postsynaptic neurons and subsequent induction of psychotic conditions.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s interesting, I’ve always wondered how NMDA antagonism in general affects the brain (as opposed to specific NMDA antagonists)</p>

<p>Magnesium seems to be calming.</p>

<p>Agmatine I read mixed reviews, some people say it’s calming; some people say it’s stimulating.  For me I notice nothing from it.</p>

<p>DXM, PCP and Memantine feels speedy to me.  Ketamine though I sit back and chill.  </p>

<p>But I don’t quite understand NMDA antagonism in general, or really the function of NMDA.</p>

<p>On the flip side what would agonism of NMDA feel like?</p>
