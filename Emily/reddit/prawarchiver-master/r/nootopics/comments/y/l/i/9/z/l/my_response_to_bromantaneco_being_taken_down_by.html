<p>Please be patient with me as I deal with njal.la delisting Bromantane.co. Because of this the new domain will be everychem.com, which I had been planning on transitioning to anyways. It will go live 11/6/22. All orders placed before this backstabbing will still be shipped, but we will be a few days in limbo as everything is taken care of.</p>

<p>Please stay updated with me, I will follow this up with another post and I&#39;m going to need your help here.</p>

<p>Going to attempt to transfer my domain from njal.la but they are acting unprofessional and possibly doing illegal things to keep me from my domain. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>I have received 0 response from njal.la and not even so much as a warning before they did that to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone did. Sirsad made a good post in r/Nootropics with well elaborated science, and a small announcement launching <a href="https://bro.co">bro.co</a>. Then he&#39;s immediately banned? Without any reasoning whatsoever? Which rule did he break? Why are comments mentioning <a href="https://bromantane.co">bromantane.co</a> removed, but not other vendors?</p>

<p>Possibly related or completely not, just wanted to bring this datapoint to this sub&#39;s attention: I remember that somebody asked MYASD if he would consider selling bromantane. MYASD replied that he wanted to, <strong>&quot;but the bank just wouldn&#39;t let us&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>Which always struck me as strange? Why not allow him to sell a compound with over 50 years of excellent safety data and no addictive qualities or other side-effects (and isn&#39;t restricted in any way)? What does the bank care about that, it&#39;s not like it would bring a risk of lawsuits. They sell other russian noots that can be VERY addictive, like phenibut...</p>

<p>Yes bromantane is banned by some sports organizations because it improves athletic performance under cold conditions, but phenylpiracetam is banned much more generally and is sold by Nootropics Depot (well not now that the world seems to have eaten all the PP :( )</p>

<p>Could it be that interests are not against Sirsad per se, but against bromantane becoming popular? Someone working on a patentable analog? A CFS drug? Wild speculation I know, but anyone can think of a reason for Nootropics Depot&#39;s bank to refuse specifically bromantane?I have no knowledge of how banks operate when dealing with medium-level companies. Are banks usually dicking around companies over details like this?</p>

<p>My order also arrived completely smashed, the packaging really isnt suitable to send something 4000 miles away, just a thin flimsy envelope with thinnest layer of bubble wrap.</p>

<p>I am very disappointed and would like either a replacement that is packaged properly or my money back.</p>

<p>I dont know why my thread was deleted or my emails are being ignored as they were both very polite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I just placed an order of bromantane off of the new site everychem.com</p>

<p>Never received a confirmation email about order through email. I hope it’s shipped Monday and no later. If shipping gets dragged out I’m just going to start making my own nasal sprays, buy Caprylic Acid (or another MCT oil, empty nasal spray bottles, bromantane powder. Do some easy math
And spray away</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey please message me your order number and a pic of what happened so I can understand and I&#39;ll refund that order, sorry USPS did that. I&#39;ve noticed that this didn&#39;t use to happen and that USPS has been more reckless lately. I bubble wrapped a hard plastic container and mailed it to my friend and there was a hole punched through the entire package and bottle, of which I wasn&#39;t compensated for and had to refund my friend for. For the time being there&#39;s no better option for me as a small business owner than to use USPS. Though I&#39;m going to offer priority shipping for domestic purchases soon.</p>
