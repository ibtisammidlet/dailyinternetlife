    <div class="md"><p>I would actually expect to have better absorption when my nasal passages are (semi-)closed. Two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It means the nasal mucous membranes are swollen, thus well-blooded(=more absorption) and have more surface area. More surface area = faster absorption.</li>
<li>Because they are swollen, the fluids you spray up there can&#39;t drain very well. So they keep sitting exactly where they need to be to get absorbed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I always notice if one of my nostrils is blocked, I get no fluid coming back out my nose or down my throat, without any effort whatsoever, while through the open nostril I feel it running down my throat within seconds.</p>

<p>(I use a spray with capsaicin (the spicy molecule of red pepper), which allows me to feel exactly where the fluid ends up, my throat burns way more than nasal passages)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Now trying to balance the fluid between your nostrils and throat without losing anything is usually an impossible task. Then I read someone saying they would lay down on their side. Did this for a few weeks, but now I could feel the fluid going down my Eustachian tube...</p>

<p>Fortunately someone else was more inventive: <strong>Lay on your bed with your head hanging down from your mattress (after spraying upright), and gravity does the trick. I do this for about 5 - 10 minutes depending on the amount of fluid.</strong> As a bonus you get way more blood-flow to your head and sounds become softer. A moment of peaceful quiet!</p>

<p>How much sprays do you use? I suggest taking more if you don&#39;t feel much. Some people take 6 sprays / day (though I would recommend to do 2 - 3 at a time, and redose every 30 mins). The effects build up with the days so that helps as well, peak maybe at 30 days? Higher dosages tend to be more gabaergic.</p>
