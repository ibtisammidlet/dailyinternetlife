<p>I&#39;m having big trouble with distractions making it impossible for me to concentrate on reading and listening to stuff. I constantly get distracted by all kinds of thought when I try. Do you have any prefered noop in terms of making it easier for you to concentrate on a subject or a task for a longer period?  </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you pop into <a href="/r/adhd">/r/adhd</a> or any Facebook group or Instagram page or offline support group and see how many people literally could not function in live before they got on medication. The people who take these drugs via legitimate prescription and see improvements in their lives vastly outnumber the people who abuse them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;long term positive change&quot; because ADHD is a neurological disorder that doesn&#39;t go away. If I were missing a foot and used a prosthetic and then someone took it away you wouldn&#39;t turn around and talk shit about prosthetics because wearing it didn&#39;t make my foot grow back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish you would be at least a little bit more considerate. I would have failed high school without medication, same with college. I would not have a life. I would be miserable, depressed, and working minimum wage. Stimulant medication is the only thing that helps with my ADHD.</p>

<p>I have tried many nootropics (yes, I tried bromantane, TAK, Tropi, even cere). I tried Methylphenidate and also all the non-stimulants. Yes, I am seeing an ADHD therapist. It&#39;s still not enough on it&#39;s own. Like, sorry bro, this is the only thing that allows me to function. Maybe that fact doesn&#39;t vibe with your rat models or whatever, but I don&#39;t care about that, I just want to live a normal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The person you linked to likely went on a Wiki spree BECAUSE they took a lower dose instead of their correct dose. ADHD peeps are well known to get into “hyperfocus” and medication can help us focus on what we are supposed to, and help us task switch easier.</p>

<p>Studies and clinical experience have shown that people settle on a dose and do not get tolerant.  The vast majority of people find their therapeutic dose and are able to stay on that same dose which stays effective.</p>

<p>People chasing a high or “feeling it” are different and most ppl with ADHD are not looking for that, we’re just looking to be able to do our laundry and not get fired from our jobs, not become superhuman everyday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sabroxy is really weak. This is because very little is absorbed  orally like few percents. In order to work it few grams are required to feel the effect. Oroxylin A itself is much weaker DAT inhibitor than methylphenidate. There is and experimental synthesized derivative of Oroxylin A which has potency similar to methylphenidate but it is impossible to obtain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sabroxy is weak in the sense that you don&#39;t feel much from it. But 100 mg reliably makes me more focused and less distracted. The difference is bigger when combined with caffeine, as caffeine makes me more easily distracted, but adding Sabroxy allows me to stay focused. Plus, it makes caffeine feel better overall. I think Sabroxy has a better synergy with caffeine than theanine, which I don&#39;t use anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, stimulants suck. NAC 2000mg/day really helped like 50% my work ethic. A lot of people develop anecdotal anhedonia, despite studies show anhedonia improvment due to high dose NAC. YMMV </p>

<p>Also if you don&#39;t have problems with cortisol throw out every adaptogen. For some reason even rhiodiola made me don&#39;t give a f*ck about what I have to do.</p>

<p>Moda/Ritalin made me jerk off all day, in my case NAC was a life changer :)</p>

<p>My ADHD brain is diff though, Stimulants only give you higher motivation and concentration. But you have to work out how to use it.

    <div class="md"><p>Sabroxy is really weak. This is because very little is absorbed  orally like few percents. In order to work it few grams are required to feel the effect.
