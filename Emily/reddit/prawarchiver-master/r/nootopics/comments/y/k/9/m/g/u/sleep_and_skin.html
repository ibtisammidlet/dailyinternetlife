        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, I&#39;ve noticed, that after taking lysine to improve the quality of my sleep, my skin also improved. I&#39;m intrigued. Yes, elastin is being synthesized from lysine, but, as we age, not only our skin deteriorates, but also sleep. Does our body need ever more lysine, i.e. it&#39;s becoming ever more inefficient in processing whatever lysine we obtain through food, or maybe there&#39;s some other connection? Maybe, the ever worsening sleep, as we age, is the reason why we don&#39;t utilize lysine as well as we once used to (i.e. bad sleep = bad skin). If you google &quot;lysine sleep&quot;, you will see that lysine can be used as a sleep aid. Remember, when we were young, we had no problem falling asleep. I once read about a theory, that the ever-worsening sleep is a self-destruct mechanism of our bodies, the every worsening state of our skin is then an indicator of how far this mechanism has progressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is super interesting.. especially because I have very hard time falling asleep. My regular schedule is 2am to 9 or 10 am of sleep. But several times a month I cannot sleep all night. Last 2 nights I was able to only fall asleep at 5 am!</p>

<p>The most hit I see is skin tone and color, and red eyes, and my hair started to grey in past 2 years. </p>

<p>I take lysine sometimes so will try to take more often to see if there&#39;s any difference.</p>

<p>But the most impactful skin booster for me personally, is regular exercise. </p>

<p>I fell of the bandwagon for several weeks and my skin not only looked tired and gray but also got major acne and dryness.</p>

<p>Then one day recently by mistake and getting caught up with neighbors in convos, I ended up on a 3 hr walk around my village, on a crisp day. </p>

<p>When I came back, tired as hell, the first thing I noticed, was my face looked beautiful, glowing, clear and eyes revived.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been working out twice since then but my skin has improved exponentially just by that one event. </p>

<p>Last thing that gives immediate reviving effect is a mask made of honey,ot of seaweed powder and a bit of moringa. If I do this even once for 2 days my skin looks lovely. What&#39;s in these ingredients?</p>
