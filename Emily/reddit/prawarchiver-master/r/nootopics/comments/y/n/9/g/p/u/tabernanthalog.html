        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Took 52 mg in the morning after a good night&#39;s sleep. ROA sublingual/oral: some grains are slightly larger though soft. Didn&#39;t take anything else or eat anything. Just coffee and water. Within about 15 minutes felt an energized, &quot;coming up&quot; feeling, though possibly placebo it was very strong, but never transformed into anything too unusual. Thinking was normal, perhaps a bit more articulate than normal. Did some reading and had no difficulty with processing ideas. Went outside several hours later and colors did seem brighter, trees and houses seemed more interesting and patterns more noticeable, but nothing dramatic and again very subjective. Conversation with companion was also normal. Finally ate about 9 hours later. Still felt bright energetic feeling. </p>

<p>Wondering if there is any info on human trials. Also wondering if there are other experiences, and if it makes sense to use time in any particular way: meditating, writing, reflecting, socializing, exercising etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ordered Tabernanthe Manii hoping to experience increased energy, clarity etc. After reading up on how great it was I ordered it. Started with one drop. Then went to 3 drops, then tried 10 drops, finally as a last try I did the whole stopper full, probably about 15 drops. Got absolutely nothing from it. Apparently a non responder. My credit card responded though lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn’t seen any positive reports on it prior to taking it. The information and studies I’ve found don’t reveal much. </p>

<p>It is very subtle, but did you measure precisely on a scale? Like I said, the thing I noticed most distinctly was a “coming up” feeling reminiscent of other broadly similar compounds, and I only tried it once so I think there’s a high likelihood this was a placebo effect. I will try 50 mg again soon to see if it is consistent.</p>

If you have no issues with this it may be difficult to notice any benefits. On the other hand, if you have a little ADHD or depression and reading is typically difficult, then this is a valuable anecdote.</p>
