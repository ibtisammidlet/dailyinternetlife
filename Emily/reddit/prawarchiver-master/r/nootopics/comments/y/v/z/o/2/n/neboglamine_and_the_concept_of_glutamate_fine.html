        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A while back I did a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/rjed4f/dserine_the_holy_grail_of_cognitive_enhancers/">guide on D-Serine</a>, but since then I have decided it is not good enough. That is despite it doing some very cool things. But for a year I have been planning to make Neboglamine, and I think this will be the answer to it all.</p>

<p>And by the way, if you haven&#39;t read my D-Serine post, I suggest you give it a read. And of course, I&#39;ll leave a conclusion at the end for all those who aren&#39;t interested in science.</p>

<h1>The concept of glutamate fine tuning</h1>

<p>Glutamate forms the very basis of thought. As such, glutamatergic drugs can be some of the most potent nootropics. We saw that with TAK-653, where cognitive testing scores improved consistently for all who participated. However, these pathways are notoriously ubiquitous and nuanced, so anything targeting it should be geared towards maximum rewards. This requires rather specific mechanisms.</p>

<p>Touching down on the interactions between AMPA and the NMDA coagonist site, it is worth noting that both AMPA trafficking and a coagonist are required for NMDA to function,<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.25.112701.142758"><sup>\</sup>6])</a> and that NMDA currents increase as a delayed response to AMPA currents.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15048122/"><sup>\</sup>7])</a> A necessary part of learning is the process of endocytosis, or weakening of synapses by internalization of AMPARs, and this appears to be facilitated by NMDA. By this nature, both AMPA PAMs<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703758/"><sup>\</sup>10])</a> and D-Serine increase NR2B activation<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016643281400326X?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>8])</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1301486"><sup>\</sup>9])</a> which appears useful for reversing trauma.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/06bsgnqli40a1.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e40b50eb88ba311de8523f756fafb0e2131c3b92">https://preview.redd.it/06bsgnqli40a1.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e40b50eb88ba311de8523f756fafb0e2131c3b92</a></p>

<p>D-Serine&#39;s role in endocytosis also seems to extend to NMDA, where it is shown to acutely internalize NR2B and mimic the antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine (NMDA antagonist), despite being a coagonist.<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b04217"><sup>\</sup>11])</a> This is mediated by increased AMPA receptor trafficking, and TAK-653 can produce similar results. Yet AMPA PAMs,<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp20176"><sup>\</sup>12])</a> D-Serine<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17854919/"><sup>\</sup>13])</a> and Neboglamine<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12917004_Activity_of_putative_cognition_enhancers_in_kynurenate_test_performed_with_human_neocortex_slices"><sup>\</sup>14])</a> can reverse the cognitive impairments caused by NMDA antagonists. And Ketamine requires NR2B for its antidepressant effects.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269589/"><sup>\</sup>15])</a></p>

<p>Glutamate fine tuning is basically the dynamic strengthening and weakening of synapses to form the most accurate memories.</p>

<p>Sound complicated? That&#39;s because it is. The dynamics between AMPA and NMDA governing thought have tons of overlap, and cannot be easily stereotyped. However, given what we know about D-Serine and AMPA PAMs, it is not a stretch of the imagination to say that a PAM of the glycine site would have added benefit. Additionally, TAK-653 and Neboglamine could even be combined, perhaps bringing a 7 point IQ increase to 15 points. This I hope to explore by following through on creating Neboglamine.</p>

<h1>Neboglamine is much more potent than D-Serine</h1>

<p>At a ~50mg human equivalent dose, it would appear that Neboglamine improves learning acquisition in healthy rats,<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-7158.1996.tb03938.x#"><sup>\</sup>1])</a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1527-3458.1997.tb00326.x"><sup>\</sup>4])</a> much like how D-Serine improved areas of short term memory in healthy young<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25554623/"><sup>\</sup>2])</a> and old people.<a href="https://www.oncotarget.com/article/7691/text/"><sup>\</sup>3])</a> Since recent data is suggesting D-Serine should be dosed at over 8g, this is a big improvement.</p>

<p>So far there has only been one comparison between Neboglamine and D-Serine, wherein a large dose of Neboglamine increased neuronal activation in similar regions as a low dose of D-Serine, but with twice the potency.<a href="https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661809003053?via%3Dihub"><sup>\</sup>5])</a> Due to the dose discrepancy, however, this data can&#39;t be extrapolated.</p>

<h1>The pharmacology of Neboglamine</h1>

<p>The most interesting part about Neboglamine is that it is a <strong>NMDA glycine site positive allosteric modulator (PAM)</strong>. In practice, it enhances the binding of endogenous D-Serine which is important because D-Serine is released regionally and during critical periods of learning.</p>

<p>In theory, this more dynamic mechanism should translate to better nootropic effects. This is supported by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/vyb4kg/a_guide_to_ampa_positive_allosteric_modulators/">TAK-653</a> being a superior AMPA PAM due to being the most selective of its class.</p>

<h1>Neboglamine is probably safer than D-Serine</h1>

<p>One legitimate caveat I encountered with D-Serine was that it caused oxidative stress, even in small amounts, and that it wasn&#39;t reversed by L-Serine <em>in vitro</em>.<a href="https://sci-hub.yncjkj.com/10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.036"><sup>\</sup>16])</a> It appears to do so on a molecular level, but also worth considering is that D-Serine may act as an excitotoxin when taken orally due to flooding extrasynaptic regions it normally doesn&#39;t exist in.<a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(12"><sup>\</sup>17])</a>00786-6)</p>

<p>It also has phase one clinical trials demonstrating safety and tolerability.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neboglamine"><sup>\</sup>18])</a> It appears they have chosen the 200mg dose for maximum effects, and because it was able to prevent ischemia at this dose.<a href="https://data.epo.org/publication-server/document?iDocId=3826953&amp;iFormat=0"><sup>\</sup>19])</a></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Neboglamine enhances the binding of D-Serine in the brain, which could be used as an alternative strategy to AMPA PAMs for cognition enhancement. In short Neboglamine could be used alone or alongside TAK-653 to improve executive function, with all data pointing towards less addictive tendencies, higher IQ and better mental stability. It is the only drug with this mechanism, and everychem will be the first to carry it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s a great overview on acteylcholine and depression: <a href="https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/mental-illness-the-cholinergic-system">https://www.leoandlongevity.com/post/mental-illness-the-cholinergic-system</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t think you have to worry about tropisetron. Tropisetron is selective. It just acts as a partial agonist at the a7 nicotinic receptor. Nicotine, which selectively agonizes nicotinic receptors, has been found to be anti-depressant. Further, deletion of the a7 nicotinic receptor has been shown to induce depression in mice. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5099687/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5099687/</a> This matches with depressed human genetic data. The a7 receptor has a giant role in combatting neuroinflammation, which partly explains its anti-depressant effects. Due to tropisetron’s selectively and the data around the a7 receptor, tropisetron shouldn’t cause depression even in those sensitive to cholinergics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t worry much about that. Tropisetron mainly is a α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, the receptor also being a target of acetylcholine and nicotine. It could still cause an increase in Acetylcholine, to which the symptoms of anxiety and depression you mentioned are linked, by antagonizing 5-HT3 receptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;know, I had a terrible time trying to take Wellbutrin once (e.g. poor working memory, word recall, verbal fluency, etc.)- which, to my knowledge, was likely due to its inhibition of nicotinic receptors. That makes me all the more interested in what partially activating that receptor may do for me.</p>

<p>For now, Tak 653 will be tested in isolation. Then I may add bromantane and/or Tropisetron!</p>

<p>I appreciate the insight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.. From what I&#39;ve read so far Bupropion exhibits the weakest inhibition at the alpha-7 nicotinic receptor (the one tropisetron also acts on), which would also explain why it doesn&#39;t affect cognition negatively in healthy people. But of course individual experiences differ, some being drastically different from the majority. I can imagine that the inhibition of the other subtypes of nicotinic ACh receptors caused those issues for you, or the weak inhibition of the alpha-7 nAChR already caused you issues. Would love to learn more about this. TAK-653 is also amazing! I&#39;m currently using Piracetam for that purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it would theoretically lead to upregulation of all the affected receptors, except the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor which upregulates with chronic exposure to an agonist rather than an antagonist. I&#39;m not sure how that would result in antidepressant effects and cognitive improvement, Bupropions main MOA is the reuptake inhibition of noradrenaline and dopamine. But that I definitely can&#39;t say for sure, since I haven&#39;t read much about this yet. Your theory is interesting though, maybe somebody is more educated on this..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In study 16, they incubated cells with L-Serine, and it produced oxidative stress due to metabolism to D-Serine, although in vivo L-Serine might metabolize into cysteine and other antioxidant compounds. But still, that was only to reference D-Serine itself, and how L-Serine did not protect from its oxidative structure.</p>

<p>In regards to eNMDA, I&#39;ve basically discovered that antagonizing it is only good for Alzheimer&#39;s. eNMDA is necessary for social defeat, and antagonizing it can worsen it (probably why Memantine failed as an antidepressant). In general I&#39;ve found out more since writing the D-Serine post. </p>

<p>On the topic of Neboglamine and excitotoxicity, it seems like it&#39;s neuroprotective rather, based on what I&#39;ve read about it. No signs of toxicity are found in the brain or body within dose range. Looks like D-Serine has off-targets besides the NMDA glycine site that cannot be excluded: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9758163/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9758163/</a></p>

<p>The study I linked showing D-Serine being excitotoxic in synaptic regions was pretty flawed, and probably not the best example I could have used. And its implications for the safety of NMDA coagonist site enhancement isn&#39;t clear, especially because antagonists at the recognition site of NMDA had greater protection than deleting D-Serine. However, this also wasn&#39;t with added D-Serine, but with added N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. To disprove the involvement of eNMDA, they used a NR2B antagonist. However, NR2B can translocate between the synaptic and extrasynaptic regions, so they probably should&#39;ve used gold nanostructured memantine, which has been shown to produce a neuroprotective effect (which also doesn&#39;t fit their hypothesis): <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988</a></p>

<p>In general there are a lot of other studies demonstrating a stronger role of eNMDA in neurotoxic response, so I think their study has a long way to go if it&#39;s to disprove the theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d avoid memantine. As mentioned, eNMDA antagonism worsens social defeat, and eNMDA is necessary for glutamatergic signaling. It&#39;s also an a7 antagonist, and a7 is important for cognition and releases D-Serine. The chronic sNMDA antagonism by memantine will also produce psychotic effects over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agmatine sulfate is not a selective NMDA antagonist. It&#39;s a very weak one if anything, and does appear to activate NR2B. It has a ton of mechanisms and in most studies it improves memory/ learning. Also seems to increase CREB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks. Memantine definitely has its flaws. It antagonizes the a7 nicotinic receptor which is very bad, as well as synaptic NMDA receptors which is also pretty bad. However the relevance of that scales with dose, and in small amounts it probably isn&#39;t cognitively impairing, likely due to more antagonism in extrasynaptic regions.</p>
