        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all.</p>

<p>I have used Bromantane for two weeks before sublingually with no noticeable effects.  I ended up titrating up to doses as high as 650 mg.  Still nothing.  I ordered the nasal spray to try, is there any hopes that I will receive an effect from nasal administration?</p>

<p>Also, I saw ONE comment on reddit that due to Bromantaneâ€™s anti-fibrotic effects, it MAY inhibit muscle protein synthesis, but I could not find any more information.  Is this a legitimate concern for using Bromantane alongside bodybuilding?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may not notice anything with the nasal spray...maybe you are a not responder to the drug...There are many things that can be interfering with your response to the drug that is why you gotta try a lot of ways of administration ðŸ˜… </p>

<p>About the bodybulding purpose...No, It is not an issue as far as I know and after trying bromantane for 6 months the mental effects on motivation, happines and even on &quot;mental recovery&quot; can be performing enhancing too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most recent, post Soviet research, was done in Canada only a few years ago.  Bromantane has no known side effects, nor is it habit or tolerance inducing.  The company who paid for the new research discovered it had a powerful regenerative effect on certain types of liver damage.  They successfully passed all phases of clinical trials, so Bromantane, under a new branded name I think, is now an Rx in Canada for liver disease of some specificity I donâ€™t know. </p>

<p>As to Bromantane not being good for bodybuilding, it was literally used by the Soviets almost completely as a performance enhancer from 1980-1989.  In those years the Russian special forces (Spesnatz) mountain units used it to combat the high elevation on oxygen intake.  Bromantane enabled them to fight and March in very high altitude, not fatigue, then recover rapidly.  Later, in the 90s, they used it across various Olympic sports for the same reasons as before, but also the endurance Bromantane provides via its effects on oxygen synthesis.  It was effective enough to be banned on the WADA list of doping drugs.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve used Bromantane off and on for 5 years and itâ€™s never not worked, but it also takes about 4 hours to fully peak and is most noticeable halfway thru a workout.  Itâ€™s a unique drug in that it changes based on your output or something.  Hard to explain.  50mg - 100mg is typically plenty, but 25mg is often enough for some.  Going over that youâ€™ll find diminishing returns, or at least no added benefit.  Iâ€™ve never heard of a non-responder, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s possible.  Iâ€™m more curious about your source though.   Did you try those doses to get to 650mg over time or very quickly?  With Bromantaneâ€™s 10 hour + half-life, you should dose once at 25mg for that day.  If nothing, try 50mg the next day, but donâ€™t keep titrating the same day waiting for a pop, because youâ€™ll shoot passed your spot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed response.  I titrated up over the course of two weeks. I donâ€™t know if we are allowed to mention sources on this subreddit, but the source I used is commonly used and is legit.  Guess I may be a non responder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem and my pleasure on the details. I researched Bromantane A LOT when i first stumbled on it, and itâ€™s a really fascinating drug, so I retained a lot of info.  For context on the Alzheimerâ€™s thing.  One of the later Soviet tests, maybe post USSR actually, believed they found some plaque buildup after prolonged use by mice at dosages in the grams.  When more recently studied by a few different groups, no such evidence was found at any dose, so there was something corrupted in the Russian results or something.  Never seen anything about birth defects, nor anything about trouble with weight loss or mass building.  Iâ€™ve had no such issues personally.</p>

<p>Not sure about sourcing either, but I can guess the source anyway, as there are very few for Bromantane.  </p>

<p>Iâ€™m on my 2nd bottle of nasal Bromantane.  It kicks in between 15-30 min and one spray at 9mg is effective, so donâ€™t start out higher than that first.  It does seem to work in a different way, more of a notable kick, but still donâ€™t expect an Adderal type kick.  Itâ€™s very different.  I usually feel it in my jaw first, just a bit of tension.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checking this person&#39;s post and comment history, it&#39;s quite obvious they have absolutely no clue what they&#39;re talking about when it comes to drugs and risk management.</p>

<p>Firstly, no - Bromantane does not cause Alzheimers.</p>

<p>Secondly, it does not cause birth defects (never heard this one before. Interesting!)</p>

<p>Lastly, if you listen to random people on Reddit who clearly are not deeply invested and well researched in the space, you&#39;re going to be taking a bunch of herbal extracts and placebo compounds that do pretty much nothing, rather than taking the actual most effective nootropics available on the market.</p>
