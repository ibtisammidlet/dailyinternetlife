        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Microdosing Fluoxetine/Prozac is said to increase neurosteroidgenesis  (Allopregnanolone) which might have anxiolytic, antidepressant and pro-cognitive.effects. There are a few experience reports on reddit which sound promising.  I wonder if anyone has experience with microdosing Fluoxetine and can report on its effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually went down this rabbit hole about a year ago and read up on a bunch of research/anecdotes and have been microdosing Fluoxetine at 1mg a day for about 6 months.</p>

<p>Overall I would describe the effects as mild but noticeable and positive. The main benefits have been anxiolytic, antidepressant and general mental fortitude. I believe that any pro-cognitive effects have been a direct result of these effects. Additionally I&#39;ve had no side effects.</p>

<p>Whether these effects are actually mediated by neurosteroidgenesis or just serotonin reuptake inhibition and related downstream effects is obviously tough to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havenâ€™t tried microdosing SSRIs but there are some supplements out there with SSRI activity. Namely, polygala tenuifolia extract and saffron extract. Both of them have a very different feel from each other, and are not exclusively SSRIs in their activity, but playing around with each of those may be safer/easier to acquire. </p>

<p>You could also try supplementing with pregnenelone which if I remember correctly is a precursor to allopregnanolone. You can buy it as a powder pretty cheaply and then you arenâ€™t forced to take the high doses that are typically sold in capsules. Dosing very low like 10-12 mg I notice a subtle boost in energy, cognition, and mood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said it&#39;s safer to acquire things from a doctor or pharmacy than it is an unregulated online supplement provider. I&#39;m not talking about regulatory failure of drug companies, I&#39;m talking about the absence of regulation on supplement providers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying doctors or pharmacies are perfect, or good, or that you have to like them. I&#39;m saying that the systems they have in place mean that if you&#39;re getting a drug from them, there is much closer to certainty that the active ingredient will be present in it, and that&#39;s not something that can necessarily be said about supplement retailers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vendors don&#39;t have to put any in in the first place. This is the entire point that I&#39;m making that you seem so determined to walk right past--supplement manufacturers can say anything they want is in there. It&#39;s like a whole industry within regulatory-based scholarship where they test supplements and find that they don&#39;t have nearly the amount of active ingredients in their products, which is not a thing you can do with pharmaceuticals bought through legal channels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make matters more interesting
Supplement and vitamin companies are leaving the quality assurance check to the brands they are trademarking or borrowing from
Because it&#39;s safer to have one company focusing on the marketing while the other focuses on safety
Being that said We&#39;ve been patenting safe and efficient extract process for different plants and chemicals for years now
Look at ksm-66, sensoril, bacognize, synapsa, Meriva, magtein, curcuwin, Albion minerals, etc.</p>

<p>All of these trademarked products are checked and processed by their individual companies that patented the extract, (by US laws) . So when it reaches the market, whether that be amazon, ebay, vitamin shoppe, or Walmart,
All the stores have the exact same quality , amount, strength and Ingredients.</p>

<p>,
In that aspect I would trust zembrin(Kanna patented extract) and polygala Tenuifolia for my depression and wellbeing than Zoloft, prozac,Wellbutrin. </p>

<p>I have 2 huge reasons</p>

<p>1: every medication I received from pharmless like Benadryl and Ibuprofen, to strong like Vicodin or percocet, always has nasty preservatives, dye&#39;s and unnecsssary fillers.
That not only affect the profile of the drug but Interfere with absorption and cause more trouble than it&#39;s worth</p>

<p>2:Every single pharmaceutical provider that supplies drugs in the US(and Europe that I&#39;m aware of) 
Get certified and approved ONCE(code word) 
They go through the process once, assuming everything is up to code and legal
Once they pass, they never ever again get monitored or checked like the first time as long as they keep supplying and their drug works as intended.
Where as FDA regulated facility that produces supplements and such is always under the scope and being monitored. 
The entire world is literally keeping watch of big vitamin brands like true niagen, life extension, swanson and spring valley, etc</p>

<p>Meanwhile we just assume everything on the backend of pharmaceutical is perfectly safe and okay to use
Because we always hear horrorstories about supplements and get concerned and the FDA start banning NAC, or NMN left and right
But we hear horror stories about medications and drugs and we think that&#39;s a given, because it happens more often than not so it&#39;s a norm</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had the exact same provider for dextroamphetamine/levoamphetamines for decades now
Same for SSRI&#39;s
On top of that, there&#39;s being recalls for certain batches and impurities found above the level permitted before
But they still sell them
Because 1 is not gonna kill you
And 2 the drug still works.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m no advocating for supplements or vitamins over drugs or listening to your doctor</p>

<p>But the ignorance that portrayed in saying vitamins are unsafe compared to an actual doctor prescribed medication  makes no sense
Maybe 10-20 years ago it would</p>

<p>But you can get sketchy pills from doctors 
Just like you can get sketchy pills from Amazon</p>

<p>If you can go out of your way to research your doctor
Your medication and your insurance</p>

<p>You can go out of your way
To research brands on vitamins
Their effects/outcome and their safety levels</p>

<p>Supplement and vitamin vendors are forced to disclose everything and anything about their facility and products 
Yet look at zantac, pzifer, Mandela, and several other pharmaceutical providers that are meant to be safe and FDA approved.
They all took longer than 1+ year release date to disclose side effects 
And most of them are being sued/hit with lawsuits about long term side effects, damages and even cancer (zantac)</p>

<p>So please just do your research
Before you take anything or put anything in your body
Honestly...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tolerance does build rather fast. Not that you&#39;ll have any withdrawals if you keep microdosing it and stop. I noticed it&#39;ll only work 2 days in a row and the 2nd day is noticeable weaker. I stick to using it once a week max but usually save it for days where I know I&#39;m gonna want to loosen up a bit. Like I&#39;ll be meeting my girlfriends parents and family this Saturday so I&#39;ll be taking 0.5mg before I go to do that lol. Honestly I just went to the doctor and asked for a prescription of Prozac for social anxiety and he had no issues with doing it. Obviously I didn&#39;t tell him what I actually planned on doing with it. I got it filled for a few months and then just said I didn&#39;t need it anymore. I probably have 10 years worth if not longer with how little I take. Highly recommend trying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just make sure you make a volumetric solution. Like my capsules are 20mg so I would put the powder of one capsule in 20ml of distilled water. I just put it in a glass dropper vial with a measured dropper built into the cap for convenience, can get them dirt cheap off of Amazon. You can put in any small container though and make sure you use distilled water and not tap water so it doesn&#39;t degrade the fluoxetine. Good luck!</p>
