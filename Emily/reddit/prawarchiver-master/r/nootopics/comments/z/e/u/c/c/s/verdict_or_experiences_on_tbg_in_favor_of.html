        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2022-12-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MadScientistRat.html">MadScientistRat</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Despite the limited literature on Ibogaine&#39;s clinical outcomes in the treatment of OPD SUD, the evidence remains undisputed for its remarkable acute OPD W/D withdrawal utility. More surprisingly, Iboaine supersedes most all well-known post-detoxification modalities, comprising the lowest rate of relapse in prolonged abstinence, even in users with protracted poly-drug use sequela.</p>

<p>Following naturally as a perfect analog of Ibogane without the cardiological comorbidities, why then are there so few (anecdotal) accounts of TBG?</p>

<p>More anecdotal experiences would be encouraging, albeit lacking (which is concerning). Although anecdotal accounts are the bottom of the barrel in terms of clinical data quality standards, some data is better than none.</p>

<p>As a clinical statistician (and Kratom user myself for pain management in lieu of painkillers after my accident), I&#39;m in the same boat facing the prospect of a lenghty W/D.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tempted to design an observational (survey/questionnaire) or experimental (informal Reddit unsupervised trial) of TBG with the objective of at least assimilating some borderline-acceptable poorman&#39;s clinical data as a cursory measure of it efficacy in resolving OPD mediated disturbances.</p>

<p>If you have used TBG to the same effect as Ibogaine (or both), for acute W/D management or as an adjunct for PAWS or for the objective of craving-inhibition/abstinence  - may you describe your OPD use history in brief, TBG (or/versus Ibogaine) response, dosage/frequency and outcome?</p>

<p>It&#39;d be extremely valuable to know what the user base/response &quot;temperature-take&quot; is on this promising compound, considering this analog has proven to be effective in rodent studies.</p>

<p>Also, would any current OPD/Kratom users be willing to undertake this collectively under a unified/standardized regimen as a mini virtual clinical trial to obtain experimental data (would involve anonymous clinical history questionnaire, a standardized dosing regimen, a daily reporting questionnaire of symptom improvement, benchmark testing, etc...)?</p>

<p>Having taken both, the ibogaine is hands-down effective at what it aims to do, though can be hit and miss. The TBG gave me weird brain-fog and disassociation without any of the benefits of the introspection and &#39;centering&#39; that ibogaine does .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the information. Did you notice any benefits with TBG in terms of physical withdrawal abatement?</p>

<p>How effective would you say Iboga was in terms of extinguishing residual Kratom/OPD mediated withdrawal disturbances?</p>

<p>Any notes on dosing and frequency? Or other notable remarks?</p>

<p>Do you recommend abstaining from or tapering down Kratom before Iboga/TBG ? Were the diminished withdrawal effects immediately extinguished/apparent?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have at least 8g of sacramental iboga bark I bought from the Netherlands years ago, but can’t take it bc I am on Suboxone. Burning a hole in my drawer and expensive too. Eventually will try it when I go back to using only Kratom bc I’ve stocked up on that for the future</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the information. Do you have any previous experiences whether successful or not using Iboga for withdrawal abatement?</p>

<p>When do you plan on using iboga/TBG/Analogs for jumping off the Kratom?</p>

<p>Have you heard of any other user accounts using Iboga/TBG/Analogs for extinguishing opioid withdrawal / abatement?</p>

<p>Any measure of the effect size or efficacy in terms of extinguishing withdrawal symptoms? Physical/psychological, or both?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bought the Iboga around 2010 or 2011 around the time I was winding down taking Suboxone. I can’t remember how much it cost, but it was pretty expensive for 8g. I did a lot of research but have forgotten most of it now. I wanted to go to Mexico but it never worked out bc of travel &amp; having to be off Sub for at least 2 weeks or whatever to take the Ibo, so I bought the bark but never ended up using it either. Eventually went to a methadone clinic for years &amp; then switched to Kratom for a couple months &amp; felt awesome but then switched back to Subs, then back to Mdone for a year then now back to subs again. Feel like shit everyday bc of subs mess hormones up so bad. I’ve bought so much Kratom over the past 1.5 years for when I switch back. I’ll probably try the bark then, but I don’t really know 8 grams will really do anything</p>
