<p>I checked this with the mods before posting – hope you all don’t mind!</p>

<p>The Centre for Affective Disorders at King’s College London is currently researching the use of lithium supplements purchased over the counter as a health supplement. If you have tried this, please consider taking our questionnaire (link below) and telling us about it (you can choose to enter a prize draw for a £10/$10 equivalent shopping voucher). It takes about 10 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://qualtrics.kcl.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_6mPrmD1zsrVRmZg">https://qualtrics.kcl.ac.uk/jfe/form/SV_6mPrmD1zsrVRmZg</a></p>

<p>This survey aims to find out more about people’s experience of taking lithium supplements, e.g., how much they took, how long for, did it help? etc… The survey is anonymous, albeit you would have to leave an email to be entered into a prize draw.</p>

<p>This project is being completed without funding by academic staff at the university rather than by any pharmaceutical company or individual with financial motivations.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Elliot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try amazon or eBay
You can find loads of suppliers or providers for lithium ororate (not to be confused with lithium aspartate which didn&#39;t work for me and many others)</p>

<p>I would recommend starting with 1 mg 
Instead of the typical 5 mg
As much sugarcoating as you wanna give lithium ororate for being low dose and harmless</p>

<p>The mineral was so good and efficient
They turned it into a drug and started prescribing it(not the ororate one)</p>

<p>So that being said 3 thing stop keep watch for while using it</p>

<p>1: your thyroid, lithium is famous for autoimmune thyroid issues, so if you get any pain or discomfort around your neck STOP</p>

<p>2: your mood, lithium is a strong serotonergic substance.
It blocks and almost inhibits a anything related to dopamine.
Hence why it&#39;s so good for bipolarity, cause it cuts down on hypomania</p>

<p>3:your kidneys and your hormones
At a high enough dosage lithium is detrimental to your kidney
So it&#39;s always good to keep an eye on those
And as for the hormones
Lithium is very estrogenic and in fact promotes the same proteins and enzymes as estrogen like
The Sirt 1 Enzymes
So get your hormones tested and checked before jumping knees deep</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Survey isn&#39;t working. My wife and I are on 10 mg daily for years. Cuts depression and overwhelmed feelings quite well. 15 mg after a short while made me feel flat so 10 is best for me. We haven&#39;t noticed any other sides.</p>
