        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>So I picked up a bottle of IDRA 21 along with a bottle of TAK-653. I just finished my TAK-653, and am currently waiting for my second shipment to arrive.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I was considering giving IDRA-21 a try. All the discussions regarding IDRA date back 5-9 years ago.</p>

<p>The consensus seemed to be that it did not play nice with other compounds and that it has a tendency to cause headaches and turn you into an emotional wreck.</p>

<p>Some individuals seem to respond very well to it, but the majority seem to not recommend or enjoy it.</p>

<p>All these posts are old though. I wanted to reach out to the community and get some new information regarding IDRA-21, interactions, and harm reduction/safety information.</p>

<p><strong>Would IDRA-21 be problematic with any of these compounds?</strong></p>

<p><em>Bromantane</em></p>

<p><em>Armodafinil</em></p>

<p><em>Agmatine</em></p>

<p><em>Lions Mane</em></p>

<p><em>Berberine</em></p>

<p><em>Caffeine</em></p>

<p><em>Oroxylin A (Sabroxy)</em></p>

<p><strong>Any input or feedback is greatly appreciated!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m new to this whole nootropics thing. The last 6 months I started taking a ton of supplements mostly to protect from Adderall and the crap side effects that have accumulated and dependence.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of the more experimental drugs and Russian drugs to play around to eventually get off Adderall. Also taking Strattera.</p>

<p>I know a lot of the things mentioned in this and other threads have low doses. I bought a lot of powders, not pills. How do you accurately measure low doses when it comes to powders. From what I have seen on Amazon, the milligram scales are not good at those low single digit and double digit numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experience on a wide range of doses with IDRA-21 and you hit the nail on the head with the side effects.  Low dose at most every other day is the only way to do it because that 48 hr half life gets you.  Otherwise its an awesome nootropic… just don’t combine it with anything that already has potential to precipitate a dysphoric headspace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Do any of the other compounds I take stand out to you that may be problematic in combination? </p>

<p>I’m thinking armodafinil may be a problem. </p>

<p>Also, do you mind sharing you dose? I was considering either 2.5 mg, or 5 mg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Np! My dose was 12mg every other day but this proved to be too much for me, I would start with 2.5 given that you already have a primarily stimulating stack already, I wouldn’t necessarily expect strange interactions with bromantane or armoda but I also wouldn’t be surprised by them, however I think the lions mane may have an unfavorable interaction given its kappa agonist activity which will be potentiated with IDRA-21</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will start with 2.5 mg then. </p>

<p>Just for confirmation, you’re referring to Kappa opioid receptors? If so, I am on Vivitrol (Naltrexone Extended-Release Intramuscular Injection) for opioid addiction. Naltrexone is an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor, to a lesser extent of the κ-opioid receptor, and to a much lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor.</p>

<p>I am curious if the Naltrexone will negate the dysphoric effects caused by κ-opioid agonism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I tried today, and I am enjoying it. I initially dozed 2.5 mg orally, waited 1 hour. In the time between, I read that sublingual dosing was superior and I also didn’t notice anything, positive or negative, so I dosed an additional 2.5 mg. </p>

<p>Went to the shooting range with friends and family, felt good and shot very well. Upon return prior to work, I dosed an additional 5 mg sublingually. </p>

<p>It’s been 4 hours since, no negative side effects. I was for a brief period slightly snappy and irritable, but I also was in a fasted state. It went away once I ate. </p>

<p>No issues combining Bromantane, armodafinil, TUDCA, Maca Root, Caffeine, CDP Choline, Beberine, and Phosphatidylserine.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice. Tomorrow, I will try out Lions Mane along with it. </p>

<p>I actually am preferring IDRA-21 compared to TAK-653, but I think it’s too early to make a call considering today is my first experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im glad you had a positive experience!  Did you happen to notice the food tasting better? The fast also likely contributed but I always felt like IDRA made food taste awesome and music sound great.  For me every day dosing was fine for about 5 days and then I started getting monster headaches and short episodes of hypomania with intense irritability… I tried to cycle it back into my stack a few times after this but I kept getting side effects back in full force so I tossed it, also I wanted to be able to use thc again because idra made it such a narrow dose window before stuff like usually unpleasant CEV’s and auditory hallucinations set in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food for sure tasted better! I didn’t even resalías that until you mentioned it. </p>

<p>What else, if anything was in your stack at the time? </p>

<p>For myself, today it was the same, I noticed the effects are much better and more pleasant once I’ve eaten. I did notice it boosted my appetite, not insanely but in a positive way. I’m on a cycle of Testosterone as well, not for HRT. For performance enhancement, physique enhancement. Using it as an PED. </p>

<p>I notice you edited it to 5 days rather than a few months. I will keep an eye on it. I dosed 10 mg again today and I haven’t had any negative effects. </p>

<p>Once my second shipment of TAK-653 comes in again, i will compare the two. Have you tried TAK653?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a brief review I posted in this thread. I just received my second bottle yesterday, so once this one is finished I think I can write a more detailed one. </p>

<p>“I really enjoyed it!</p>

<p>I found <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> suggested dosage of 2 mg to be too low for me. I tried dosages from 2 to 10 mg, with 6-8 mg being the sweet spot for me. Once this next bottle arrives, I will stay at 6 mg daily. I also found at doses above 8 mg per day, it caused irritability and made me somewhat emotionally numb and socially withdrawn. </p>

<p>It took 2-3 days to be &quot;noticeable&quot;, but I particularly liked how vivid my dreams were and how refreshed I felt upon awakening. It created a state of clear-mindedness 45-90 minutes after dosing in the morning. I dosed immediately after waking up. Whatever brain fog I may have been experiencing in the morning, TAK-653 alleviated it. I will say, I noticed the intensity of this effect reduced after day 7.</p>

<p>I found it significantly easier to retain information during lectures, especially in Math. I also added 15 mg of PRL-8-53 after establishing a baseline without it, and they were very synergistic together.</p>

<p>My mood improved a lot after 4 days of consecutive dosing. I found it easier to maintain complex conversations (by complex I mean intellectual, deeper conversations rather than &quot;small talk&quot; type conversations). I also found myself more patient, able to wait for my turn to speak more so than before.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice any significant effect on motivation, effort perception (someone else also discussed this in another thread),  or focus. Memory improved a lot along with mood.</p>

<p>I stacked it with Bromantane Nasal Spray as well, and I enjoyed the two together.</p>

<p>Overall, I will be purchasing more and plan on running TAK-653 at a minimum until the fall semester is over.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do now, but I had to make changes with the introduction of Bromantane.</p>

<p>The first two days, I dosed my usual armodafinil dose along with Bromantane and noticed headaches and overstimulation that made me feel paradoxically dysphoric and tired. </p>

<p>I cut out Armod for two days, and the side effects went away but I noticed I would be very sleepy in my afternoon classes. I gradually reintroduced armodafinil back, starting at 37.5 mg.</p>

<p>I now have it dialed in. I take 150 mg of armodafinil upon awakening. If absolutely necessary, I will redose 37.5 around lunch time. I do not experience side effects with this regiment.</p>

<p>Before starting Bromantane, my dose was 375.5-450 mg daily. Lower doses of both modafinil and armodafinil have never been effective for me. </p>

<p>For reference, I’ve been using modafinil since 2014 (on and off, with occasional periods of 3+ months off). I’m currently using Armod just because my vendor had a special and I couldn’t refuse the deal.</p>

<p>In my experience, it works best cycled. It does not have a cumulative effect, in fact I believe (don’t quote me) it becomes less effective with daily dosing. That seems to be the community consensus as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;m curious about is if IDRA-21 will interact with Agmatine. I&#39;ve taken both, but I don&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve taken them at the same time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a few things you should know about IDRA-21 and Agmatine. Keep in mind, I&#39;m not an expert or scientist. I&#39;m just a guy who reads a lot.</p>

<p>Agmatine activates AMPA receptors <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061850/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27061850/</a> and so does IDRA-21. So they might have a synergistic effect, or I don&#39;t know. Maybe both are a little too much. If you try it let me know.</p>

<p>AMPAkines make your neurons more sensitive to the neurotransmitter Glutamate. Too much Glutamate, or sensitivity to it, is a bad thing. It can cause Glutamate excitotoxicity. But Agmatine also protects against Glutamate excitotoxicity. So maybe there is no problem.</p>

<p>Magnesium Threonate does much of the same thing as Agmatine, but has no effect on AMPA receptors, so I think it would have no interaction with IDRA-21 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507254/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507254/</a>   </p>

<p>Let me know if you test out the stack. IDRA-21 is one of my top 5. I love the stuff. I&#39;m curious to see if it works well in your stack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoyed it!</p>

<p>I found <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> suggested dosage of 2 mg to be too low for me. I tried dosages from 2 to 10 mg, with 6-8 mg being the sweet spot for me. Once this next bottle arrives, I will stay at 6 mg daily. I also found at doses above 8 mg per day, it caused irritability and made me somewhat emotionally numb and socially withdrawn. </p>

<p>It took 2-3 days to be &quot;noticeable&quot;, but I particularly liked how vivid my dreams were and how refreshed I felt upon awakening. It created a state of clear-mindedness 45-90 minutes after dosing in the morning. I dosed immediately after waking up. Whatever brain fog I may have been experiencing in the morning, TAK-653 alleviated it. I will say, I noticed the intensity of this effect reduced after day 7.</p>

<p>I found it significantly easier to retain information during lectures, especially in Math. I also added 15 mg of PRL-8-53 after establishing a baseline without it, and they were very synergistic together.</p>

<p>My mood improved a lot after 4 days of consecutive dosing. I found it easier to maintain complex conversations (by complex I mean intellectual, deeper conversations rather than &quot;small talk&quot; type conversations). I also found myself more patient, able to wait for my turn to speak more so than before.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice any significant effect on motivation, effort perception (someone else also discussed this in another thread),  or focus. Memory improved a lot along with mood.</p>

<p>I stacked it with Bromantane Nasal Spray as well, and I enjoyed the two together.</p>

<p>Overall, I will be purchasing more and plan on running TAK-653 at a minimum until the fall semester is over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food for sure tasted better! I didn’t even resalías that until you mentioned it. </p>

<p>What else, if anything was in your stack at the time? </p>

<p>For myself, today it was the same, I noticed the effects are much better and more pleasant once I’ve eaten. I did notice it boosted my appetite, not insanely but in a positive way. I’m on a cycle of Testosterone as well, not for HRT. For performance enhancement, physique enhancement. Using it as an PED. </p>

<p>I notice you edited it to 5 days rather than a few months. I will keep an eye on it. I dosed 10 mg again today and I haven’t had any negative effects. </p>

<p>Once my second shipment of TAK-653 comes in again, i will compare the two. Have you tried TAK653?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At that time I was taking semax, concerta, caffeine, and motsc with it and also I started using low dose bromazolam and spiraled into taking 15+mg per day for a week or two so yeah the timeline is a tad fuzzy.  Never tried TAK, I will be watching for your review</p>
