I am back with yet another IDRA-21 related question lol.</p>

<p>I was wondering if dosing TAK-653 with IDRA-21 still active would be problematic and/or counterproductive. </p>

<p>My last IDRA-21 dose was ~30 hours ago, so I most certainly still have IDRA-21 active.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is copied and pasted from another IDRA-21 post I made but this was my experience: </p>

<p>“I really enjoyed it!</p>

<p>I found <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> suggested dosage of 2 mg to be too low for me. I tried dosages from 2 to 10 mg, with 6-8 mg being the sweet spot for me. Once this next bottle arrives, I will stay at 6 mg daily. I also found at doses above 8 mg per day, it caused irritability and made me somewhat emotionally numb and socially withdrawn. </p>

<p>It took 2-3 days to be &quot;noticeable&quot;, but I particularly liked how vivid my dreams were and how refreshed I felt upon awakening. It created a state of clear-mindedness 45-90 minutes after dosing in the morning. I dosed immediately after waking up. Whatever brain fog I may have been experiencing in the morning, TAK-653 alleviated it. I will say, I noticed the intensity of this effect reduced after day 7.</p>

<p>I found it significantly easier to retain information during lectures, especially in Math. I also added 15 mg of PRL-8-53 after establishing a baseline without it, and they were very synergistic together.</p>

<p>My mood improved a lot after 4 days of consecutive dosing. I found it easier to maintain complex conversations (by complex I mean intellectual, deeper conversations rather than &quot;small talk&quot; type conversations). I also found myself more patient, able to wait for my turn to speak more so than before.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice any significant effect on motivation, effort perception (someone else also discussed this in another thread),  or focus. Memory improved a lot along with mood.</p>

<p>I stacked it with Bromantane Nasal Spray as well, and I enjoyed the two together.</p>

<p>Overall, I will be purchasing more and plan on running TAK-653 at a minimum until the fall semester is over.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was just TAK-653. I only tried IDRA after I ran out of my first bottle. </p>

<p>I also have really enjoyed IDRA, I think TAK is more sustainable and suitable for everyday use. I will post my experience with IDRA once I have some more experience, I only have run IDRA for a week between shipments for my TAK-653.</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>
