<p>LSD I haven‚Äôt dabbled with, usually do shrooms as my micro dose of choice LSD always scared me (likely just feeding into propaganda but still lol)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoops, I meant mcg/micrograms. That would be very expensive. Sorry</p>

<p>But if I had the money, I would do it. I took very high doses of D2 which can deposit calcium in soft tissue, and K2 activates MGP proteins in arteries, which studies show to be promising for arterial decalcification. There is a 50mg MK4 supplement out there for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes I was meaning mcg as well. 
Yes I know some K2 is beneficial, but Dr. Brad Stanfield just went over One recent study that just showed no benefit in preventing calcification or removing any calcification at 720-1080 MCG dose (even though they saw great activation in GLA proteins)</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Yohimbine</strong>.</p>

<p>IME, yohimbine is shockingly powerful for the mental (libidinal) side, which you said is your main interest. You may well become a sex fiend for one to two hours. This is because it&#39;s an Œ±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; its MOA is therefore very different from that of most other supplements or pharmaceuticals in this space.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty potent for the physiological side of things.</p>

<p>The major downside of yohimbine is that many ppl experience significant jitters / anxiety starting around one to two hours after ingestion, lasting maybe for another two to three hours. I therefore almost never take it. Also, it may make your heart thump.</p>

<p>If you buy it, make sure you choose a reliable brand. Some studies have reported that a lot of the yohimbine out there is adulterated with sildenafil, caffeine, etc.</p>

<p>Other options: <strong>Tribulus terrestris</strong>, high-quality <strong>tongkat ali</strong>, <strong>maca</strong>, <strong>boron</strong>. Generally, people take these over weeks, but you can take a double or triple dose of any of them and sometimes notice a libidinal boost within 30‚Äì90 minutes. I find tongkat ali and maca mildly stimulating libidinally, but don&#39;t like taking them on a daily basis because they both decrease cortisol (which will be a plus for some people but makes me drowsy). Tribulus and boron I like better.</p>

<p><strong>Panax ginseng</strong> (i.e., Korean ginseng / Asian ginseng) can be very good too, but ppl react differently to it, so try it out first.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve already mentioned nitric-oxide inducing supplements like citrulline. <strong>L-arginine</strong> is also good in that department. Or you can just take <strong>sildenafil</strong> / <strong>tadalafil</strong> / <strong>vardenafil</strong> / etc. (PDE5 inhibitors). Note that they increase testosterone and DHT, so they not only help with the physiological side but can help with libido.</p>

<p>In the pharmaceutical dopaminergics department, addition to the bromantane you mention, there&#39;s also <strong>cabergoline</strong>. Many ppl report increased libido. Has a very long half-life, for better and worse... I think you take it once or twice a week.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <strong>melanotan II</strong>, which has an unusual mechanism of action, via the melanocortin receptors. Unfortunately, it causes nausea. I read years ago about some couple who would take it together, f**k like rabbits, take a break to vomit, and keep going. Not my idea of a good time, but hey, horses for courses. There&#39;s also <strong>bremelanotide</strong>, which I believe is a metabolite of melanotan II and seems similarly to cause nausea. IME, mild libido boost + significant nausea. I think this kind of designer stuff is overkill and not worth the money.  YMMV.</p>

<p>But for libido, none of those compare to yohimbine. You may or may not feel a libidinal effect with any of the others, whereas I&#39;ve never heard of anyone taking yohimbine and not noticing SOMETHING, whether they like it or not. It&#39;s like rocket fuel... be careful with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...also, take <strong>zinc</strong>, <strong>magnesium</strong>, and <strong>Vitamin D</strong> in the evenings. All of these can help with libido. Of the three, zinc is the most important for libido IME. Also improves sperm count and sperm quality.</p>

<p>However, all three have only a subtle and gradual effect‚Äîwill take at least a few days to be noticeable.</p>

<p>All three also reduce cortisol, which can be very good in general but is probably not what you want before sex (unless you suffer from anxiety). They make me sleepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can‚Äôt thank you enough for this information. Extremely detailed and comprehensive. </p>

<p>Since you seem to be well versed on the matter I‚Äôll ask you. Would rauwolscine (a-yohimbine) be interchangeable with yohimbine? I have some on hand that‚Äôs why I ask. If not I‚Äôm more than willing to pick up some standard yohimbine especially given your endorsement. It‚Äôs pretty inexpensive all told</p>

<p>I remember I was a yohimbine fiend up til about a decade ago (spike energy drinks had it in them) and my libido was ungodly. I just chalked it up to being 20 years old lol but you‚Äôre not the first to mention yohimbine but definitely the most detailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean yohimbine? If you live in the USA, there are tons of brands available on Amazon and other supplement sources. I believe its sale is banned in Canada. Not sure about other countries.</p>

<p>The only kind I&#39;ve ever tried is TwinLab Yohimbe Fuel 8.0. That product may not even be made anymore. It was a bark extract of yohimbe, which contains yohimbine and presumably some other compounds.</p>

<p>Looks like Bulk Supplements sells Yohimbe Extract and Nutricost sells Yohimbine. I&#39;ve never tried either product specifically, but I&#39;ve found those brands to be reliable no-frills suppliers of other supplements.</p>

<p>There are a lot of bodybuilding-oriented yohimbine products out there too. I&#39;m sure most are just fine, but check and make sure they don&#39;t contain caffeine too, unless you want that.</p>

<p>...and if I&#39;ve violated rules on this sub about mentioning particular products, my apologies.</p>

Bromantane I guess a few sprays are no biggie, but try eating 1-2 electrolyte tabs before dabbling with this shit.
Measure your micronutrients and get them somewhat stable before.
You won‚Äôt believe the clarity or mindset you can experience from correcting just something like potassium or sodium, If your a lacking. I regard it as something according to a psilocybin microdose..</p>

Phenibut is also legit for that.

<p>I‚Äôve never used phenibut, I read some horror stories about it and it‚Äôs addiction potential and given my family is littered with addicts I thought it would be best to avoid it. Could be unfounded fear inflated by Internet anecdotes but I wasn‚Äôt willing to find out lol</p>

<p>Thanks for the input I appreciate it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s legit, highly recommended.
The Phenibut stories are highly overblown imo. All those people are ones who legit abuse it in the 5g+ doses and take it everyday day for weeks or months on ends even. I&#39;ve been taking it twice a week for years on end and have had no problems with it
Yeah no problem~</p>
