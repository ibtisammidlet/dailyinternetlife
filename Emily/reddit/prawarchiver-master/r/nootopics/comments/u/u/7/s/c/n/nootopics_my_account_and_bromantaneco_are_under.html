        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Listen up. Things are not as sweet as they may seem. Ever since I made this place, it and myself have been under constant attack by competing forces.</p>

<p>First of all I want to start this off by saying any mention of u/sirsadalot or &quot;<a href="https://bromantane.co">bromantane.co</a>&quot; on r/Nootropics, r/StackAdvice results in immediate deletion. If you really want to tell others about my products, you should either privately message them or use different subreddits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am aware the r/Nootropics moderators are plotting something even greater. There are various ways they may attempt to slander me:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Calling me a scammer.</strong> First of all this is easily disprovable because I have fulfilled many orders and use a mainstream payment processor. Many people here can vouch for what I do.</li>
<li><strong>Saying I&#39;m making false claims.</strong> Everything I say is based on some study, and I never confidently say anything without proof.</li>
<li><strong>Saying I don&#39;t test my products.</strong> I know this is the most common tactic they use, however I came prepared. In addition to having purity of testing, I do conduct third party testing here in the states for everything I sell, to ensure authenticity. I would never sell a bunk product.</li>
<li><strong>Misc.</strong> Using their automod to brainwash everyone like they have done for other companies, astroturfing to spread negativity about my brand, etc. The bottom line is that I cannot do anything to defend myself from them and so it&#39;s an unfair situation.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/z7n79l0kci091.png?width=496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a4cf22a388c9bfc0176efd8123bab4631d03a6d">Screenshot taken by my friend. I am not sure if he&#39;s affiliated, but this is clearly blackmail.</a></p>

<p>The above user, u/MezDez, claimed that I was lying about the content of the Russian document I provided in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/">this</a> post, due to me not translating it to English for him to read. However I thought me translating the document would destroy its credibility, so I opted to just link the <a href="http://library.lol/main/CD8E44AA817FFB656E936429BF0A8496">original Russian book</a> instead. At the time my hands were tied and I couldn&#39;t translate it for him. My good intentions here were taken advantage of, and he made me look like a liar despite my accuracy. I wasn&#39;t expecting people to have so little faith in me, but they did.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here is the complete English translation for anyone interested: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uters3/the_pharmacology_of_adamantanes_full_english/</a>. I would never lie about this kind of stuff. Every claim I made in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/ufdwng/bromantane_spray_research_dump_shipping_prices/">this post</a> is true.</p>

<p>As far as the r/Nootropics moderators are concerned, I am also curious how far they&#39;ll take it. They&#39;ve already attempted to stop our small community by mass reporting, lying about our intentions and saying we harbor the trade of illegal drugs. This has resulted in my account being temporarily disabled multiple times, losing the NooTopics discord servers twice, among other things. We are working on getting <a href="https://nootopics.org">nootopics.org</a> set up as a wiki/forum/blog, however that may take some time. Until then the only surefire way to never lose access to this community is through <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#server:nootopics.org">matrix</a>.</p>

<p>This is after their failed attempts to say I&#39;m a shill for my friend&#39;s company <a href="https://Pglchem.com">pglchem.com</a>. It is now obvious I am independent, and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t take credit for John&#39;s company. Them banning me was unwarranted.</p>

<p>I am especially paranoid about the potential of them swatting me, doxing me, attacking my payment processors or other, more personal forms of harassment. I know they have my address because I was a past customer of ND and told MYASD my order number. I will refrain from condemning him of wrongdoing unless I have proof, and I have tried my best to not let this stuff affect my private life. I&#39;m just saying it could happen. They have a lot of money and connections too.</p>

<p>If anyone has any advice for how I should handle this serious existential threat to our community, please let me know. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big pharma&#39;s goal is to keep people sick so they can keep selling their products which usually do not cure the problem but only hide the symptoms so they can keep selling their medicine for very long and gain huge profits. Certain nootropics will be a huge problem for them because for example bromatame which is suppose is linked on dopamine and if i guess correctly, it helps you to break addictions just like rhodiola rosea. We are nowdays addicted to videogames, porn, tv series and in a bunch of other useless crap. </p>

<p>Big pharma wants us to only take coffee as a stimulant because it causes tunnel vision which means we want to get from a to b and not see things around it. They want us to complete certain task but never question their authority or their falsely made studies about many topics especially in food industry what the general population thinks is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t believe in the validity of studies, how are you so sure these alternative therapies are so efficacious?</p>

<p>I think there are definitely things that have use in a kind of personalized medicine approach, but I don&#39;t think there are that many blockbuster nootropic therapies being forced out.</p>

<p>I agree with a weak version of what you&#39;re saying, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s more a matter of the evolution of the system rather than that of a huge conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some studies are better made but if you have enough money, you can mislead the public into believing into something as a scientifically valid if you would just do 1000 poor quality studies versus 10 good quality which indicate otherwise.</p>

<p>Coffee industry for example could make tens of thousands of studies which would be quite poor quality (manipulating statistics) that indicate that coffee and caffeine is good while on the other hand there could be for example 20 good quality studies which would indicate that coffee and caffeine is bad for you using good scientific methods. </p>

<p>Now a newspaper/new media article pops up about coffee and its huge health benefits. If you would claim otherwise they would just say that &quot;Well there is 10000 more studies which will prove that coffee is very good so you wrong&quot; </p>

<p>Money can buy science nowdays and that is the saddest part. In the most controversial topics such as nutrition the people with the money are not afraid of spending couple billions or even tens of billions into convincing the public that their industry &quot;Scientifically valid&quot; </p>

<p>They have 1000 times more money than the richest nootropic, nofap, pro health/ free information/ freedom activist supporter could ever have...</p>

<p>And yes this is a grand conspiracy it sounds crazy and i doubted it for 4 years but there is just too much evidence and cues which indicate that this is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right in a broad sense, in that money dictates the quantity of the research, and that if you throw enough dirt some will stick, but I don&#39;t think anyone is so much shooting down amazing breakthrough therapies so much as they are bolstering questionable ones and minimizing their risks due to the fallacies of sunk cost and lack of alternatives.</p>

<p>There are individual groups who stand to profit from continued (over)medication, and so that&#39;s a valid concern, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a huge cabal trying to shoot down the distribution of, say, tropisetron and bromantane, because, without being prescribed and pushed by the medical establishment, they&#39;ll never seize a high percentage of the market. They&#39;re just not a threat. We&#39;re not even on the radar.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Big Antipsychotic and Big SSRI are certainly a threat to the public health (which is not to say they have no use whatsoever) due to the overzealous use of their drugs, but I don&#39;t think this justifies persecution fantasies on the part of nootropics users.  The percentage of people who can be helped noticeably by, say, phosphatidylserine or olive leaf extract isn&#39;t large enough to be a problem for big pharma.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Capitalism ensures that if something works for a group large enough to constitute a customer base and profit can be made, it will be sold to them. Point blank.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So much about medicine, especially mental heath, is totes befucked, but the nootropics industry isn&#39;t really all that big of a threat thereto. Mental health is a 225 billion dollar industry in the US alone. That&#39;s not being unseated by some dudes selling herbs and importing random meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no affiliation with u/sirsadalot.</p>

<p>I had no idea that this sort of censorship was going on, until <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/urr26h/sciencebio_is_out_of_bromantane_what_are_the_best/">this poster</a> asked for a source for bromantane.</p>

<p>I shared a link for bromantane.co, and a short blurb about why I thought it might be a good option.</p>

<p>When I happened to check back with my browser (which is logged out) I noticed that my comment was missing.</p>

<p>I made the comment again.</p>

<p>Immediately gone. </p>

<p>I checked my logged in app, both of my comments still showing. Weird. Since it happened so quickly, I assumed it must be an automodertor of some kind, either from the fact that my comment contained a link, or because of the target domain of the link.</p>

<p>No sweat, I&#39;ll just not hyperlink, and type &quot;bromantane (dot) co&quot;</p>

<p>This worked...</p>

<p>For about 20 min. </p>

<p>Poof.</p>

<p>I try again.</p>

<p>Makes it up for just over an hour, then disappears, which means that there is both automatic, and manual censorship/supression of u/sirsadalot and his company Bromantane.co.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who is pulling these strings, or why exactly, but something stinks in the state of Denmark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s easy to live in a bubble as far as these things go, I suppose.</p>

<p>You&#39;re likely right, I guess... People love to air personal complaints, so the very fact that things aren&#39;t being said openly is suggestive of financial motivation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just puzzling, since you sell mostly bromantane. S.bio has been out for a while, and ND never carried it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for that....</p>

<p>I kind of bought that s.bio is just selling off the rest of their inventory (I audibly chortled at the claim that they were going to &#39;destroy&#39; the rest of their inventory though), but it has been going on for a little long now. ND kind of stepped out of the &#39;exotics&#39; game a minute ago, or at least have de facto done so for the most part.</p>

<p>I kind of thought that ND, Cuerpoymente, Ceretropic was one thing, and that THT, IRC and S.bio were another, but they might have some backroom established common interest I haven&#39;t intuited.</p>

<p>You&#39;d know better than I; it all looks pretty open for a rising star to me, but maybe there&#39;s something in the works with SARMs or something that&#39;s being fiercely protected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mention anything positive about Limitless Life Nootropics and it gets auto deleted as well. I even put 3rd party testing results of our bromantane that we had purified by a 30 year Sigma Aldrich vet chemist in the group. They said they were not valid because they didn&#39;t know who Reddy Chem tech was. Nagari Reddi was a master tech at Sigma for 30 years. His job was purifying chemicals. The batch he purified was the best bromantane we ever had. It was so pure there was no residual smell at all. Ever seen bromantane with no smell? Unfortunately he sells cbd and natural products now so no more purification services but while he worked with us, our bromantane was near 100% pure. Welcome to the club. Longecity is where the smart people go to learn, not reddit. Just don&#39;t play the game. Disappear from reddit on their groups. This is the attitude you need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2h2ZixoCCWI">https://youtu.be/2h2ZixoCCWI</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, they could come after you if they wanted to. But, I don&#39;t think this is that kind of situation. You&#39;re right, you are paranoid.</p>

<p>It is a bit fucked the power that mods have. So I like there being more subreddits about nootropics. But with the way reddit works, that&#39;s their prerogative. A while back the subreddits existed to shill Nootropics Depot and Examine.com, but now it seems more neutral to me. So, don&#39;t let it get to you if you have to abide by their rules. No one is allowed to shill. </p>

<p>You link a message from someone who isn&#39;t even associated with <a href="/r/Nootropics">/r/Nootropics</a> , so I don&#39;t see how the mods are slandering you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never purchased anything from you. I&#39;ve never seen anything negative, except well the paranoia in this post. If I were to purchase something from you, oddly I&#39;d prefer that it be tested at MYASD&#39;s lab: <a href="https://omnientlabs.com/contact/">https://omnientlabs.com/contact/</a></p>

<p>Many labs will tell you what you want to hear, so third part testing is still doubtful.</p>

<p>If you had legit proof you had good product, at least some science to back up the relevance of the product, and you seemed less paranoid, I would consider buying from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mezdez has nothing to do with the r/nootropics moderators. I’ve known him for several years now. He just called out inconsistencies he saw with sirsadsalot theories. He got banned after commenting his thoughts here. I’d assume his “scam comment” is not from a place of saying the product is fake/low quality, but the research/reasoning is flawed. </p>

<p>As for the rest of this I have no dog in the fight. Will be interesting to see if I get attacked or banned for commenting in “Mez’s favor” or rather seemingly commenting “against sirsadalot”. I just know for a fact Mez isn’t involved with the r/nootropics team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, you can speak on behalf of u/MezDez. But your friend was making very poor arguments and ignoring data, trying to make me look bad as his primary goal. In fact what he was saying was in complete contrast to the study I provided. So I took it as an intentional assault, and banned him thinking it was already established enemies.</p>

<p>After all, how can someone claim to be educated and then deny science? It just seemed like they were trying to manipulate people who don&#39;t actually read the sources in an attempt to make me look bad.</p>

<p>I will unban them on the condition they follow the rules of this subreddit. One such rule is that you mustn&#39;t make psuedoscientific claims. Tell them they can feel free to message me to be let back in, instead of messaging others behind my back send sending people to raid the subreddit.</p>

<p>People can seem very unhinged when they&#39;re feeling threatened, like a dog backed in a corner.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is &quot;crazy&quot; but more an evolutionary advantage. Hypervigilance keeps us alive.</p>

<p>And in this case, I can say from first hand experience that there is, in fact, a coordinated and concerted effort to supress Sirsadalot and his company. I don&#39;t know what the extent or motivations of this are, only that it simply <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>I know what I sell is good because I research things a lot more than most people. In fact, I used to be practically the face of r/Nootropics before they banned me abruptly for selling $600 worth of Bromantane to a few people. But before even that I spent years writing articles and giving out advice for free, and you can&#39;t take that from me now by making me out to be a shill. I just deserve to make a living doing what I love.</p>

<p>If you actually knew the science behind what I sell you&#39;d stop looking at me as a person and instead focus on what could be achieved with science. I&#39;m a researcher first and a businessman second.</p>
