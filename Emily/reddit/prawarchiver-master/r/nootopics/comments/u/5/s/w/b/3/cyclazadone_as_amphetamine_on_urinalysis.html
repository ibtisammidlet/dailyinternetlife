        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am on probation and have a urinalysis tomorrow. It&#39;s a lab test. My dumb ass thought cyclazadone would not show up and was legal for me to take. I did not realize that pemoline shows up on tests, with cyclazadone being a derivative of pemoline. After some minor research it seems pemoline causes false positives for amphetamines on drug tests and I assumed cyclazadone would too, although two threads on reddit say otherwise.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience in taking a drug test after taking cyclazadone?</p>

<p>In the lab test process would they even have false positives or is everything gc/ms tested?</p>

<p>I have no problem in not taking it, but I just found out today I have to test tomorrow and I had taken it yesterday. Im probably fine regardless but would like to be more comfortable in my decision than I am currently. Hopefully I didn&#39;t fuck up.</p>

<p>Edit: Passed the test. HOWEVER, this could be due to dosage or because the test was 48hrs after administration. Please don&#39;t use this answer conclusively if you&#39;re coming from google. I intend to take my own test with it 100% in my system soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got the results. I passed!</p>

<p>However, that could possibly be due to dosage or because the test was 48hrs later. I wouldn&#39;t use this answer conclusively just yet.</p>

<p>I want to get tested with some 100% in my system, to update you guys. I don&#39;t have money to do so just now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should in most cases be able to ask them to do an actual lab test with a higher degree is specificity if it&#39;s positive, with you only footing the bill of it still comes back positive on retest.</p>

<p>I&#39;d find some other things that throw up a false positive and tell them you took one of those, thus hopefully ensuring they take a closer look.</p>

<p>It would be really weird if they tested for pemoline, and it&#39;s not really all that similar to amp, so you may be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main concern is I had found online that pemoline quite often causes false positives for amphetamines. I think this is already gc/ms tested, so I should be good. I just took the test. Ill let you guys know either way...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude if it’s a False positive, then they send it to a lab and the lab will show it’s not amphetamine. It won’t show what it is, just what it’s not. Many things can cause false positives, even bad cups/strips. They can’t violate you for a failed immunoassay lol. Worst case they lock you up for 3 days until the lab test comes back. Chill.</p>
