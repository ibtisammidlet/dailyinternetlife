<p>Caffeine tolerance is primarily from adenosine receptor upregulation, so taking dopaminergics is fine, but it won&#39;t hurt to abstain from these too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d say maca, or tyrosine and phenylalanine maybe - these will help you comedown and not crash so hard (or, it’ll make the tolerance break easier since you won’t get hit with the withdrawals (if you do), is what I meant to say). </p>

<p>Ginseng may be good too (it’s quite energizing, especially the Asian one apparently), as well as some cordyceps, shilajit, and perhaps even some ashwaghanda (some people (like myself) find ashwaghanda energizing. I also find it relaxing though). Gotu kola is another good one worth looking into. It’s slightly energizing in the lower doses, becoming more sedating and relaxing in the higher doses (due to its effect on GABA signalling); but is, all-around, a really good one for getting things done while being awake and calm. I like it.</p>

<p>I’d recommend looking into lemon balm too - the rosmarinic acid in it is very good at causing an increase in beta brain waves, while it also (either that or the eugenol) inhibits the GABA transaminase enzyme from breaking down GABA; thus helping keep you calmer (but not knocking you out). </p>

<p>Rhodiola was good - pretty energizing but alright. Not my favourite though. It felt a little too…idk, it just didn’t sit right with me. Made me a bit uncomfortable and could give me a bit of anxiety sometimes; along with making me a bit too aggressive and shut down (emotionally). </p>

<p>I’ve tried theacrine before and didn’t really like it (same for dynamine), but most people seem to love it. It’s basically like a really long, smooth caffeine effect, but much much nicer and better; much cleaner too. Dynamine was like a short, powerful theacrine, but a little more dynamic and robust. </p>

<p>Modafinil and adrafinil may be good too, but keep in mind you’ll be awake for about 12-15 hours, and just won’t be able to go to sleep (the entire time). Lingering effects may make it a bit hard to fall asleep, but by and large this stuff is nothing to fall asleep on once it’s done - amphetamines are worse. You can easily just take some chamomile and melatonin and pass right out; I used to do that all the time. </p>

<p>Oxiracetam would be a good one too. It’s pretty stimulating, but not in a way that’s at all like caffeine. Very good, and very different; but very enjoyable. May make you somewhat emotionally plain though (blunted/flat emotions). Pramiracetam may be good too, but keep in mind it’s just like a stronger, more logical (i.e., emotionally blunted), and I think longer-lasting oxiracetam. So, keep that in mind. </p>

<p>Noopept is a really good one - one of my favourites (back when I used to do it). I’d highly recommend you just use that in general anyway, but it’ll be good for this too. </p>

<p>And now, for the pièce de résistance: amphetamines! Yes! For only the small small price of down-regulating your dopamine receptors long-term, and potentially getting too aggressive, feeling like shit (over time), and being a complete, stimmed up asshole, you too can enjoy the experience of amphetamines! Perfect for keeping you awake for those long, tireless hours, and helping you get all your work done and accomplishing all your tasks! Ask your doctor today, if amphetamines are right for you! </p>

<p>Ahahaha, I’m just kidding. Two things though: 1. Amphetamines are actually great tools when used responsibly, and I really just put that in there as a joke. 2. I do not recommend going to a harder drug on a two week break from a lighter one xD. <strong>This was merely just for comedic purposes, and I have no intent of promoting the use of such a substance unless absolutely necessary. It can be a slippery slope.</strong></p>

<p>All-in-all though I hope the rest of this list helps!! Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any, and I’ll do my best to answer them : ). </p>

<p>Much love man &lt;3

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks you can you reccomend a stimulating ginseng because nds 50 percent genosides did nothing and whats the differnce in terms of fixicaly and mental stimulation between oxiracetam and noopept</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Hawkeye19972.html">Hawkeye19972</a> 2022-04-11</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Fixicaly? </p>

<p>Also, for a ginseng try to find a Korean Red ginseng. Usually those are the most stimulating. But, don’t forget, the use of the word “stimulating” is slightly wrong here - the better word would be “energizing”. </p>

<p>Ginseng is mostly something that helps restore energy, and it can take a long time before that actually becomes noticeable. It is not something you will notice on day one. You’ll have to take it for many weeks before the full effects are finally noticed, and they should get stronger as time goes on; meaning you’ll need less and less of it in order to stay where you want to be (sort of like a reverse tolerance. This is usually called a “maintenance dose”). </p>

<p>It’s not stimulating in the way that stimulants are, it’s more energizing; if you know what I mean. So, that may have been why it wasn’t very/as noticeable for you. Plus, it may have just needed time.</p>

<p>As for the mental stimulation difference, I’d say noopept and oxi are pretty similar; it’s just that noopept feels more natural to me - there’s more of a flow state. I much prefer that over oxi’s logical, “sit in one place” sort of thing. The stimulation though is probably about the same degree, and it’s not really a stimulation anyway. It’s like modaf - you’re awake, but you’re not really wired; you’re just awake. You feel more drive to do things; and I found noopept was far better and holistic at doing that than oxi. It was just easier to focus and work on tasks, as there was less of a robotic-like feel. The energy felt less draining. </p>

<p>Not quite sure if that answers your question, but I hope it does! If not, I’ll try and find a way to explain it better</p>
