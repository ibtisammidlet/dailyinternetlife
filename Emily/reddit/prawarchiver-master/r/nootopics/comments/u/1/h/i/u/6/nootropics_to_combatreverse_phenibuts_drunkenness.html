What do you take to stop that when you REALLY need to get things done? Caffeine sometimes will exacerbate &amp; make things worse, turning you into a hyper non-functioning drunk that cannot sleep nor focus.</p>

<p>Is there a nootropic that somehow sobers you up?<br/>
Please don&#39;t be like the jerks in the phenibut sub, <em>I posted this there once and they cried about how it&#39;s ppl like me who will get this stuff banned (my dose is less than 1.5 grams btw)</em><br/>
<em>- Benadryl is not an option</em><br/>
<em>- Moda &amp; Racetams (choline sources too) will normally intensify phenibut&#39;s effects &amp; action.</em><br/>
<em>- Piracetam works a bit but seeking something better</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your question is how to sober up?
Stop taking phenibut
However you can experiment with different stimulants to &#39;counteract&#39; the drunk effect. 
Caffeine was too stimulating? Sabroxy might be a option it is quite new although you should look to its profile. 
Why are you taking phenibut first place? Is it for a high or is it to have fun or just to combat anxiety symptoms?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. Even 250mg now makes me feel so bad. I simply used to use it for its social anxiety benefits. I used to be able to take 500mg to 1g and navigate social encounters better than I ever could naturally. Verbal fluidity, insecurity, sensitivity, all improved. In that sense it was a nootropic for me, by reducing my anxiety and sensitivity it allows me to think and speak much more clearer and naturally. </p>

<p>I wish I found a way to combat the fatigue and intoxication from 250 - 500mg. But at this point I can&#39;t risk having a day or two of feeling bad to test stacks. I&#39;ll have to wait for a long weekend or when my contracts are up. I hope people post some stacks they found useful for countering the fatigue and balancing its anxiolytic effects.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure why people respond negatively to this question, I thought Reddit was a good place to ask questions and get answers/anecdotes, which I need right now to figure this out, especially when taken early in the day for a quick 10 AM meeting, then need to put in some work around 3 pm.</p>

<p>Again, this doesn&#39;t always happen... Sometimes it works perfectly for its purpose without affecting the rest of my day, but other times something needs to be fixed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically speaking, it was sold on all nootropic websites until recently, unlike Bromantane. Some people see both as drugs (Ladasten &amp; Noofen) while others consider them Nootropics (Depending on your angle/how you see things).</p>

<p>I did not intend to bother, nor cause any unwanted energy... I am just curious. Actually, I respect what you&#39;re doing and thought this sub was about discussing Nootropic Topics freely, as in sharing studies/findings also anecdotal information without prejudice.<br/>

<p>I just searched and came up with these?  If you could kill Phenibut it could have wider implications. Definitely interesting. To wit: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792056/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7792056/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally have never been unable to function properly because of Phenibut, even when taking 1.5 gram at once.</p>

<p>But I guess if it were to happen, phenylpiracetam would be pretty sobering.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what you think, if you take more than 250 mg of phenibut at once, and more than 750 mg in a day, you are abusing it and looking for trouble (and obviously your cognition will suffer)</p>

<p>If you wanna use phenibut as a nootropic, you shouldn&#39;t take more than 50 mg (I&#39;m not even sure of that, but that&#39;s what another redditor told me, that nootropic effects are achieved with low doses of 25-50 mg. Haven&#39;t tested it). 250 mg is an anxiolytic dose and any more than that is recreational. And phenibut is not a good substance to use recreationally. Even once every 1-2 weeks leads to horrible rebounds in the majority of people after a while. Took a few months for me. Now I can&#39;t do it anymore, it makes me anxious, and then gives me a horrible rebound about 2 days after, which lasts for 24-48 hours.</p>

<p>Kava is much better than phenibut and doesn&#39;t cause rebounds, dependence or tolerance.</p>
