        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is allowed to post here .This is just my experience as a person who suffers from social anxiety all their lives, and I decided to share it in case anyone else suffers from it too. I suffer from social anxiety all my life, I used a lot of marijuana in my adolescence, today I am 25 years old. About 3 years ago I discovered that dopaminergics (Any Stimulant) make my social anxiety practically disappear. I get extremely outgoing and speak whatever I think without fear, build confidence, enjoy socializing, go out in search of conversations, literally as if I had no social anxiety.</p>

<p>This made me start using cocaine, ritalin, mdma, (coffee doesn&#39;t have much effect on me because I have ADHD), but when I&#39;m under some stimulation I feel like a normal person in the socializing part. The problem is that when everything passes, I regret every word I said to each person, it makes comedowns extremely psychologically painful.</p>

<p>Everything I said in a night or afternoon while I was stimulated comes back to my head with something I shouldn&#39;t have said, sounded stupid, etc. (Social anxiety). So I decided that as much as I become the person I would like to be when I&#39;m under some stimulus, it&#39;s not worth it because of the thoughts I have afterward when everything passes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been suicidal for thinking too much about the things I&#39;ve said to people. Anyway, this is just my anecdotal story, in case anyone else feels that way, I would love to know. thank you so much for reading</p>

<p>One to consider is anxiolytics. Kava is safe and effective:   <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00048674.2010.522554">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00048674.2010.522554</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone with lifelong social anxiety, I know how you feel. I was on the coke/addy/Ritalin/etc phase for too long. The social shame rebound is real. For those symptoms in particular, I have found supplements that increase testosterone are key, additionally I add non-addictive energy drugs.</p>

<p>For increasing T, I take tongkat, cistanche, shilajit, and occasionally take cordyceps for a couple weeks at a time. Energy boosting supplements include bromantane and NMN/NR, plus shilajit and cordyceps work for that too slightly.</p>

<p>I first noticed the social anxiety reduction with shilajit, then moved into the others once my tolerance grew quickly, but still lacked a desire to socialize. Bromantane and NMN/NR resolve that for sure. Bromantane increases my desire for socialization, and with NMN/NR I never run out of social energy or ruminate.</p>

<p>My two cents if you&#39;re looking for alternatives to traditional stimulants. If that&#39;s too much for now, at the very least I recommend purchasing NAC and agmatine sulfate to reduce symptoms like rumination and overthinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds familiar. I experienced similar symptoms also when I used benzos. I have no stimulant history other than caffeine and MDMA. Caffeine helps like an hour when dosage is right. MDMA did nothing, all I felt was more enjoyment of music.</p>

<p>SSRIs are helpful with these shame issues after socializing. Annoying part is you don&#39;t feel much positive emotions either.</p>

<p>Phenelzine is likely the best helper with SA for most people. Just impossible to get where I live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely my experience as well,to the point of even being over talkative at times to mask anxiety when I was anxious. But nowadays I feel way more at ease and find myself taking less caffeine and stimulants,imo Apigenin is really the main thing helping in that regard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also smoked a lot of weed as a teen and have social anxiety. </p>

<p>Stimulants can make socializing easier, but I feel like it puts me on another wavelength than other people so I&#39;m less charismatic / likable. I prefer alcohol as my drug of choice for social lubrication.</p>
