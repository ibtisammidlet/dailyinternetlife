        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Welcome to my newest project. Now satisfied with my dopamine research, I&#39;m taking on other challenges such as increasing human IQ. So I was very much excited reading <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028">this</a> study, where GTS-21 improved working memory, episodic memory and attention. Not only was this conducted in <em>healthy</em> people, but these domains of cognition are important to IQ, consciousness and executive function, respectively.</p>

<p>GTS-21 is a failure, and I&#39;ll explain why. But it&#39;s a selective α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist, so we can learn a lot from it. This led me to discover Tropisetron, a superior α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist and also 5-HT3 antagonist.</p>

<h1>The α7 nicotinic receptor and nicotine</h1>

<p>Before progressing, I would like to outline the discrepancies between nicotine and α7 nicotinic receptors.</p>

<p><strong>Addiction:</strong> This is people&#39;s first thought when they hear &quot;nicotinic&quot;. But nicotine is not a selective α7 agonist, and in fact it has more bias towards α4. This is what causes dopamine release, and therefore euphoria and addiction.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/"><sup>\</sup>6])</a><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/31/8202"><sup>\</sup>10])</a></p>

<p><strong>Cognition:</strong> Unsurprisingly, short-term cognitive benefits of nicotine are likely mediated by α7 nicotinic receptors. This is bolstered by Wellbutrin (Bupropion) not impairing cognition in healthy people.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-005-0128-y"><sup>\</sup>11])</a> Compared to other nicotinic receptors, its affinity for α7 is the lowest.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10991997/"><sup>\</sup>12])</a></p>

<p><strong>Tolerance &amp; Withdrawal:</strong> Tolerance at the nicotinic receptors is atypical and occurs through multiple mechanisms. In nicotine&#39;s case, α4 upregulation on inhibitory GABAergic neurons contributes to this, as well as the reduced dopamine release during withdrawal.<a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/31/8202"><sup>\</sup>10])</a> But with α7s, it would appear it a structural issue of ligands themselves, with some remaining bound long beyond their half life and &quot;trapping&quot; the receptor in a desensitized state.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/"><sup>\</sup>7])</a> This, along with nausea is what caused GTS-21 to fail.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746983/"><sup>\</sup>4])</a> But this doesn&#39;t appear to be the case with Tropisetron, which could be due structural dissimilarity, or perhaps it acting as a co-agonist and &quot;priming&quot; the receptor for activation, which is why increasing acetylcholine enhances its nootropic effects.<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.02.025"><sup>\</sup>2])</a> Aside from the fact that Tropisetron is quite literally an anti-nausea medicine with a long history of prescription use.</p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong> α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonists appear to be better anti-inflammatory agents than nicotine.<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00509509/document"><sup>\</sup>9])</a></p>

<h1>Tropisetron, α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist and 5-HT3 antagonist</h1>

<p>In the medical world, treating illness is priority. As such, studies in the healthy are uncommon. However, Tropisetron has improved cognition in conditions characterized by learning disorders, such as Schizophrenia.<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0685-0"><sup>\</sup>3])</a> Nootropic effects are also shown in primates<a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.02.025"><sup>\</sup>2])</a> correlating with the results found in healthy people given GTS-21.</p>

<p><strong>Multifunctional:</strong> It is a very broadly applicable drug, showing promise for OCD,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31575326/"><sup>\</sup>23])</a> and Fibromyalgia. Also anxiety, but only mildly.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7871001/"><sup>\</sup>16])</a> It reports strong antidepressant effects in rodent models,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084677/"><sup>\</sup>15])</a> which correlates with other 5-HT3 antagonists.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20123937/"><sup>\</sup>21])</a> 5-HT3 antagonism is a desirable target, as it isn&#39;t associated with side effects or tolerance<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10706989/"><sup>\</sup>13])</a> and appears neuroprotective<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31243157/"><sup>\</sup>20])</a> and pro-cognitive<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8983029/"><sup>\</sup>17])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2140610/"><sup>\</sup>18])</a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12622180/"><sup>\</sup>19])</a> potentially due to enhancing acetylcholine release. An atypical SSRI and 5-HT3 antagonist, Vortioxetine<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851880/"><sup>\</sup>14])</a> was also shown to improve cognition in the majorly depressed, an unexpected outcome for most antidepressants.</p>

<p><strong>Alzheimer&#39;s and excitotoxicity:</strong> α7 nicotinic receptor overactivation can cause excitotoxicity. But a partial agonist is neuroprotective, dampening excitotoxic potential while stimulating calcium influx in a way that promotes cognition. But Tropisetron is also valuable for Alzheimer&#39;s (AD), binding to beta amyloids and improving memory better than current AD treatments such as Donepezil and Memantine.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uvtp29/tropisetron_and_its_targets_in_alzheimers_disease/"><sup>\</sup>25])</a> It is a 5-HT3 antagonist, but this doesn&#39;t appear responsible for all of its neuroprotective effects. Improved blood flow from α7 partial agonism appears to play a role.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/uvtnal/tropisetron_but_not_granisetron_ameliorates/"><sup>\</sup>26])</a></p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong> Tropisetron shows promise for lifespan extension and healthy aging with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects,<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32088214/"><sup>\</sup>22])</a> has data to suggest it benefits fatty liver disease<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21903748/"><sup>\</sup>24])</a> and although it was GTS-21 to be trialed, potentially ADHD. Tropisetron is mildly dopaminergic at low doses (&lt;10mg), and antidopaminergic at high doses (&gt;10mg).<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/030097400446634"><sup>\</sup>8])</a></p>

<p><strong>Tropisetron stacks?</strong> Similarly to Piracetam, it would appear increased acetylcholine improves its memory enhancement. ALCAR, an endogenous and potent cholinergic seems logical here. Tropisetron&#39;s antidepressant effects are potentiated by increased cAMP, so Bromantane or PDEIs such as caffeine would make sense.</p>

<p><strong>ROA, dose, half life and shelf life:</strong> Tropisetron is best used orally at 5-10mg. It has a half life of 6 hours but effects that may persist for much longer. Shelf life is around 3 years.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Tropisetron fits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corneliu_E._Giurgea">every criteria</a> required to earn the title &quot;nootropic&quot;. Furthermore, it may be one of the most effective in existence due to its selective actions at α7 nicotinic receptors and 5-HT3. Tropisetron encompasses a wide range of potential benefits, from improving cognitive function to generalized benefits to mental health.</p>

<p>Route of administration: Oral. Effective at 5-10mg, and a solution with 20mg/mL is available. The pipet is labeled, so the concentration is accurate every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean yeah. And it&#39;s great. My stack is Tropisetron 10mg + Bromantane 2 sprays + white willow bark extract + ALCAR + a few cups of coffee. Sometimes I take other things like a multivitamin, Hesperidin, DL-Serine and more. Every once in a while Pemoline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha we&#39;ll see. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen yet. Depends on how much more potent it is for me subjectively, because if done right I&#39;ll have to re-evaluate the dose. If the dose is significantly lower then it&#39;ll be worth it, but if not it may just be an expensive failure. Cyclodextrin and the process costs time and money, so it better be worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why willow bark?  I can guess but tell me.  I favor TCM herbs....dan shen, pseudoginseng, myrrh.</p>

<p>ALCAR one of my favorites. Coffee okay but heavy on cacao and epicatechins.</p>

<p>I am 57 and still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAKup3Qqwk">competitively wrestle</a>.  I want to feel like a beast.  Healing from injuries from past competition. Nothing major.  Cryotherapy, Sauna, Compression.  Pulling some lipomas. But I know there is more that I can &#39;reach or achieve&#39;, even at this age. I want to dominate. I have the skills.  Just getting the mind and body to assimilate correctly.</p>

<p>Help me, please. I want to get the biochemistry part down.  Delving fairly deep as is but my knowledge is not at your level. PM if you wish to humor me.  I&#39;d appreciate it. I have a special set of knowledge in herbalism that may parlay your digs.</p>

<p>*I just ordered a trial of the tropisetron.  Fan of bromantane, via your recommendation almost a year ago. Fan of Agmatine sulfate, via your recommendation. Memantine....have you mentioned?  Finding it helpful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking badass that you’re still competing at 57, I’ve wrestled since HS and currently train MMA and am hoping to begin competing soon. Bromantane/Alcar have noticeably helped me more rapidly improve areas of my game. Agmatine is great for recovery, as well as Cistanche and Tongkat if you haven’t tried those yet. Those two can be very hit or miss on an individual basis; however, I heartily recommend them after years of on and off usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently tincturing a gallon of this formula for training. Focus on sinews, bones and muscle resilence. I keep bpc-157/tb-500 peptide injections readily available if I fudge something up. Now realizing that I think my one finger is broken for past two months, which is why it didn&#39;t heal, but truthfully my joints have endured minimal pain.</p>

<p>Herbs impacting Nrf2, Sirtuin, ampk, and epigenetic pathways: epimedium/horny goat weed, cistanche, eucommia, polygonatum, solomons seal, drynaria, morinda, noni, coix seed, cibotium, cynomorium, notopterygium, acanthopanax, achryanthes, dipsacus, myrrh resin, schizonepta. I have another formula for when I really fuck something up and need to release heat from blood. And I do herbal extracts, like tongkat and such, but at my age, I pulse T every few months in modest doses. Helped significantly my mental clarity.</p>

<p>I have a few of my past wrestlers doing mma out of The Lab in AZ. I coach year round at private club for ambitious youth. The mma fighters do like my herbal formulas. Regarding your comments on alcar, bromantane, agmatine...all part of my game. Good shit. Phenylpiracetam with citicholine is another one to toss in for training, 1-2 x a week. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So from the current human studies we see liver enzymes elevated in 1% or less of patients. Note that doesn&#39;t mean 1% had significant damage, and in fact enzymes recovered after withdrawal. However this very fact also means for some individuals it does have this outcome. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it&#39;s oxidative stress. I would use TUDCA as a means to prevent this, as it not only protects the liver but it even regenerates it.</p>

<p>ALD and NALD really aren&#39;t that different. And the best solution to NALD is reduced glutathione, zinc, betaine and TUDCA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It completely stripped me of my personality. I became a full blown robot that couldn&#39;t feel any emotions EVER. I became very antisocial and wanted to be alone all the time focusing on useless nonsense. I lost all interest in all my hobbies. My mental health tanked and my physical health wasn&#39;t good either. It literally only took 3ish months to notice I was losing my emotions, by the 5th month it felt like it had a lobotomy done to me. I don&#39;t care how productive I was, I&#39;d literally rather be shot then live like that. I was only using maybe 10-30mg of Dexedrine a day. Towards the end I tried lowering the dose down to 5-10mg daily to lessen the side effects but it didn&#39;t help so I said fuck that shit and had my doctor give me my armodafinil back and called it a day. I only use the armodafinil 1-2 times a week though since it doesn&#39;t remotely help with my ADHD anymore regardless of how long I take a break from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I’m only 2-ish months in on Vyvanse (lisdexamphetamine). </p>

<p>I generally take it at 8am, and while I feel great between like 9 and midday, I get terrible anxiety at around lunchtime for a couple of hours. It’s meant to last a lot longer due to the metabolic rate-limiting step of stripping the lysine from the dexamphetamine, but it just doesn’t for me for some reason. </p>

<p>I think I’ll either try adderall / dexamphetamine, then methylphenidate before trying a non-stimulant (as I am already on duloxetine).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d go for Dexedrine if you are absolutely gonna try a new one. Adderall really sucks because of the levoamphetamine in it and most people tend to agree on that. Dexedrine is extremely smooth, maybe try the extended release version but if Vyvanse isn&#39;t lasting long enough then I doubt XR Dexedrine will be any better. You should look into Mydayis. It&#39;s an very long lasting version of Adderall XR but even longer lasting. Instead of it having 2 parts of the pill that releases throughout the day it has 3 parts to it. I personally never tried it but I heard decent things from people where Vyvanse doesn&#39;t last long enough. I&#39;ve considered trying out a very low dose XR methlyphenidate since the side effects are more forgiving since it&#39;s not a dopamine releaser and just a dopamine re uptake inhibitor but after my last experience with amphetamines I&#39;ve been very cautious about it.</p>

<p>One thing I didn&#39;t see you mention much of is the &#39;cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway&#39;, which is mediated by alpha-7 nicotinic receptors on macrophages and governs a lot of the vagus-nerve based cross-talk between the brain and the gut (here&#39;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1430829/">a good overview of the topic</a> if you wanted one). Anti-inflammatory properties are an underappreciated element in nootropic drugs, since inflammation can have such negative effects on cognition.</p>

<p>A bit of a nitpick, but antagonism of alpha-7 nicotnic receptors often does not impair cognition since the receptors are quick to upregulation. You mention memantine, and alpha-7 antagonist, and while early in treatment it can cause sedation and cognitive impairment, it often results in improvement in cognition after a short period. Likewise, the lack of sedation/cognitive impairment in bupropion is not &#39;proof&#39; per se that alpha-7 is more involved in cognition than the nicotinic receptors that bupropion drug does block.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What source have you seen where memantine improved or didn&#39;t impair cognition in a healthy person? Both NMDA antagonism and a7 antagonism reduce excitototixicty which is why they help neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s. But make no mistake, this impairs cognition. How memantine got looped in with nootropics I have no clue.</p>

<p>I think that Wellbutrin <em>not</em> impairing cognition in healthy people does actually support what I&#39;m saying, so I&#39;d like you to expound if there&#39;s more to this debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Memantine has gotten looped in with nootropics because people often have really positive effects from it. You can sift through <a href="/r/nootropics">/r/nootropics</a> and <a href="/r/MemantineHCl">/r/MemantineHCl</a> and find lots of reports of neurotypical people getting enhanced cognition from it.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately understudied in neurotypical humans - most human studies are for people with dementia, and a few for those with ADHD. These latter studies (such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30663824/">this one</a>) do suggest to me an application in neurotypical people, as the mechanisms underlying ADHD more reliably scale upward past &#39;neurotypical&#39; into &#39;enhanced cognition&#39; than with dementia.</p>

<p>The real force behind my argument comes from rat studies though. There have been several that show cognitive enhancement from memantine in normal mice. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2019.00073/full">Here&#39;s one</a> that specifically addresses the alpha-7 issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another explanation for the interaction between memantine and PHA-543613 involves alpha7 nAChRs as the same target of both compounds. Taking into account that memantine is also an antagonist of the alpha7 nAChR while PHA-543613 is an agonist of the same receptor, their additive effects might be explained by the agonist-induced desensitization effect (Quick and Lester, 2002). In their commentary, Banerjee et al. (2005) also refer to similar effects of alpha7 nAChR agonists and antagonists, and imply that antagonism or desensitization of the alpha7 nAChR may result in beneficial physiological and cognitive effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128866/">Here&#39;s another one</a> that discusses a few alternative explanations for the effect:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Memantine has actions other than NMDA antagonism that may also account for the effects observed here, such as antagonist effects at 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (Rammes et al., 2001) and α7 nicotinic receptor channels (Aracava et al., 2005). In addition, memantine has been reported to increase brain-deprived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA (Marvanova et al., 2001). Of consequence, BDNF enhances the induction of long term potentiation in the hippocampus (Figurov et al., 1996). Moreover, an interaction between BDNF/trkB signaling and NMDA receptors has been found to have an important role in the development of spatial memory in the hippocampus (Mizuno et al., 2003).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BDNF connection is interesting, and seen in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22205542/">this other study</a> where memantine is used to combat opioid addiction. If that were the main mechanism behind its nootropic effects, then it does not show that alpha-7 antagonism is itself nootropic but at least that it does not interfere with nootropic effects from other mechanisms.</p>

<p>Another possibility, I&#39;ll grant you, is that memantine&#39;s potential therapeutic effects on disease states are so broad - dementia, ADHD, addiction, OCD, anxiety, nerve pain, etc. that most people present with a subclinical form of at least one of these things, and memantine&#39;s apparent nootropic effects are actually just from treating these problems. But that may very well be true for plenty of alleged nootropics since human studies often have not-very-robust selection criteria.</p>

<p>As for my comment about bupropion, I guess another way to put it is this: bupropion, which blocks alpha-7 to a much lesser extent, does not cause cognitive impairment. Based on this, you want to claim that alpha-7 antagonism does cause cognitive impairment. However, if alpha-7 antagonism did <em>not</em> cause cognitive impairment, then bupropion would <em>still</em> not cause cognitive impairment - i.e. it would not cause cognitive impairment regardless of whether alpha-7 antagonism did have that effect or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, you mean <strong>low dose Memantine</strong>. I&#39;ve read that study before. So I can actually explain this:</p>

<p>Antagonizing extrasynaptic NMDARs enhances CREB (master learning/ memory protein) and prevents excitotoxicity (also mediated by extrasynaptic NMDARs). This is a valuable nootropic mechanism, and Memantine is somewhat selective to extrasynaptic NMDARs. But it&#39;s still a bit dirty, and the study you linked tries to prove this by <em>subeffective</em> a7 agonism alongside it.</p>

<p>The nootropic effect is definitely extrasynaptic NMDAR antagonism, though. No doubt about that.</p>

<p>Synaptic NMDAR antagonism is cognitively impairing, however, which is why I thought this nanostructured memantine selectively targeting extrasynaptic NMDARs would be more valuable: <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988#:%7E:text=AuM%20is%20a%20selective%20antagonist,10%20%CE%BCM%20memantine%20(right)">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01988#:~:text=AuM%20is%20a%20selective%20antagonist,10%20%CE%BCM%20memantine%20(right)</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be able to carry it but it&#39;s been on the back burner for a while now. Along with Neboglamine and CX-1739 (but I may just make Aniracetam Cyclodextrin instead).</p>

<p>As far as regular Memantine dosing, people always go too high and I honestly feel like whatever mild nootropic benefit a low dose would produce would be outclassed by Magtein which is also an extrasynaptic NMDAR antagonist, albeit indirectly by saturating with magnesium leading to more extracellular Magnesium preferentially targeting extrasynaptic regions. This showed nootropic effects in aging people which imo is pretty decent evidence comparatively.</p>

<p>Memantine is okay, I just think the dose discrepancy severely limits the payoff. And raving anecdotes aren&#39;t normally something I count as evidence (no shade, just explaining myself here) so this is why I&#39;m not super hyped about it.</p>

<p>And as for ADHD, yeah that could be attributed to D2 agonism: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syn.20472">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syn.20472</a></p>

<p>But you know me, I deem this inferior to the actions of Bromantane, ALCAR and Pemoline in terms of dopaminergic payoff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate on why you think the nanostructured meantime would be worthwhile in humans? Just curious, that paper is interesting but mostly seems like a proof of concept for avoiding synaptic effects while preserving extrasynaptic effects, unless you have found further evidence of beneficial effects? I&#39;m just intrigued by your interest in this compound so I&#39;m looking forward to a discussion on that subject if your into it.</p>

<p>From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Nanostructured memantine] exhibited neuroprotective properties both in vitro and ex vivo during such neurotoxic insults as NMDAR-mediated cytotoxicity in cerebrocortical cell culture and oxygen-glucose deprivation in acute hippocampal slices. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, in my book neuroprotective effects are always  welcome, but I&#39;m curious how the neurotoxic insults they speak of would translate to the everyday life of a healthy human brain? Perhaps you think it applies moreso to mental health issues (which are thought to involve overhactivation of NMDARs, as you mention previously, IIRC)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, [Nanostructured memantine] prevented dendritic spine loss triggered by Aβ oligomers in organotypic hippocampal slices and was more effective than free memantine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I have to do some research regarding this to be sure, but I think Aβ oligomers refers to the pathology of Alzheimer&#39;s, so this statement means the authors found evidence suggesting nanostructured memantine would have increased efficacy for the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s. Think that would confer any benefits to non-Alzheimer patients (such as ourselves)? I guess that preventing any dendritic loss caused by Aβ oligomers, however little, is beneficial as well, healthy brain or not.</p>

<p>Admittedly nanostructured memantine is new in concept and could benefit from more research. However antagonizing extrasynaptic NMDA is responsible for a lot of the pro cognitive effects seen with Magnesium and low dose Memantine. Such as the increase in CREB seen from such a MOA. This strengthens NMDA function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At most I expect it will increase anti-depressant effects. Coincidentally I just took my first 5mg dose while on an SSRI, but this was just 20 mins ago so can&#39;t comment on it yet.   </p>

<p>The problem with SSRI&#39;s is that they non-specifically just increase serotonin all over the brain. There are 7 different types of serotonin receptors and some of them even have sub-types (e.g. 5-HT2a, 2b, 2c). We know now that for anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effects some of these receptors should be more stimulated (which is what the SSRI does by increasing serotonin), but a lot of them should be less stimulated (blocked/antagonized), while an SSRI just stimulates all of them. In that way an SSRI actually prevents a lot of good effects that it produces by stimulating the right receptors, by also stimulating the wrong receptors.  </p>

<p>Tropisetron antagonizes 5-HT3, which is exactly one of those receptors that you would want to block. Tropisetron thus will block the stimulation of that receptor by SSRI&#39;s and in that way will probably increase the anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant effects.  </p>

<p>It should be completely safe as the only interaction is that it reduces the effects of an SSRI on 5-HT3 receptors.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read, 5-HT3 antagonists have been associated with asymptomatic electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of the QTc interval). How does tropisteron avoid this?</p>

<p>Also, is constipation a common side effect?</p>
