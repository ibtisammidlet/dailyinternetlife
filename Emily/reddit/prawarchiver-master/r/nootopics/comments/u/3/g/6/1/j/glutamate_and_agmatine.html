    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, essentially</p>

<p>”Agmatine binds to two sites of the NMDA receptor (neither of which bind glutamate) and functions as a noncompetitive inhibitor. It can competitively inhibit polyamines from activating the receptor&quot;</p>

<p>From the examine research breakdown</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its too complicated for a 10 year old haha... ill do it anyway but it wont give you many answers as there simply arent many established about agmatine yet.</p>

<p>It has effects on the NMDA receptor in the brain, but it deactivates it. Compared to glutamate, the endogenous ligand (the normal chemical for this receptor), which activates the receptor. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, meaning its normally working all over the brain to activate/excite/stimulate your neurons.</p>

<p>Compare the NMDA receptors and their excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (its more complicated but anyway, broad strokes) to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and its corresponding GABA receptors. GABA receptors have a somewhat opposite function in the brain, where they shutdown/inhibit/deactivate your neurons when they bind with the right ligand (as in, when GABA the chemical binds to the GABA receptor, it makes the neuron kind of shut down and not communicate with other neurons, thats why GABA is an inhbitory neurotransmitter)</p>

<p>Anyway, agmatine deactivates the NMDA receptor. It doesnt do that by interfering with glutamate, the main neurotransmitter that activates NMDA receptors, which is probably good because drugs that do this typically cause dissociative effects, for example ketamine or PCP.</p>

<p>It does however interfere with the binding of other neurotransmitters to the NMDA receptor which are also required for the normal function of the receptor however this role and its influence on the effects of agmatine in humans is currently not well studied.</p>

<p>Again its complicated - NMDA receptors are a so-called &quot;coincidence detector&quot; in that it requires 1.glutamate presence 2. glycine presence and 3. magnesium absence sumiltaneously to be activated...</p>

<p>Competitive and non-competitive are related to both: </p>

<p>a. agmatines exact binding location on the receptor, its non-competitive with glutamate so it doesnt bind to the same site as glutamate, but its competitive with polyamines (in this case glycine and serine IIRC) so it binds at or near the same site </p>

<p>b. its ability to push out the correct neurotransmitter (or other compounds) from the site at which it is a competitive ligand. Meaning if glycine is binded to the receptor, agmatine can come in and bind to the receptor, pushing glycine out. Its not that simple though as it depends on their binding affinities and the concentration of agmatine </p>

<p>Like I said if your looking for easy to understand info, your way too deep over your head perhaps with this topic. Focus on understanding the basic concepts of psychopharmacology such as the different receptors and corresponding neurotransmitter and their general roles in the brain, the difference between agonist/antagonist, the difference between enzyme and receptor, the basic concepts of the neural synapse.</p>

<p>Then you can start with the basic pharmacology of way more well-understood drugs that have effects on only a couple neurotransmitter sytems such as methamphetamine, methylphenidate, diazepam, morphine, etc. Something thats been studied a shit load that you can find endless explanations better than mine on their pharmacology to help you understand more complex topics like agmatine (a compound that hits a huge array of neurotransmitter systems with a variety of different actions at each, so much crossover with multiple other drug classes, and a nearly unestablished effect profile in humans coupled with a very poorly understood or unclear mechanism of action)</p>

<p>Basically, if you have to ask for a further a breakdown of the info in the breakdown of the research breakdown from examine, you should read way more official publications about psychopharmacology such as textbooks and articles to fill that gap, instead of asking some rando on the internet to ELI10 because, for all you know, I couldve been making all that shit up haha.</p>

<p>I didnt make shit up by the way, I tried to help you out as best as I can, I am insanely passionate about the topic of neuropsychopharmacology and I enjoy sharing knowledge in this manner becasue it helps solidify my understanding to have to explain it to someone else. Its just that agmatine is complicated and not well researched in humans yet, plus NMDA receptors are real complicated too, our brains are complicated as fuck...</p>

<p>Side note: its crazy to think about one of our brains (mine, or yours) trying to comprehend the molecular mechanisms behind the function of our brains: it takes a lifetime of study to even catch up to the forefront of current research in neuroscience, not even talking about how the precise function of our brains is not fully understood by any human and research is constantly pressing deeper and revealing new information that makes the subject even more intricate and fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>25c-nb,   I’m extremely grateful for the time you’ve spent explaining this. I understand more now, 🙏, but I’m going to try and understand it further. </p>

<p>The main reason I ask is that I regularly take Kratom leaf, sometimes then take 2 g of Agmatine ( NMDAAntagonist ) to reduce tolerance, but it also causes the euphoria to disappear. I’m trying to understand how this works. </p>

<p>I’m now planning to take Kratom stem and vein ( as opposed to leaf) , which is a NMDA Agonist, to help wean off and reduce dependence.</p>

<p>However, I’m trying to understand precisely what the two combined will do ( NMDA agonist and NMDA Antagonist will do. ) and impact on me.</p>

<p>Any advice greatly appreciated or sources that may explain. 🙏</p>
