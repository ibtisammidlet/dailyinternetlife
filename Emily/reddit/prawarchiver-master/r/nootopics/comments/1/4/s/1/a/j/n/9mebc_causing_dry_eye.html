    <div class="md"><p>Because there are hundreds of positive anecdotes on it, in fact I would say more than Bromantane even. I have not seen any severe negative reactions to it at all. Sure, there’s not as much literature to support it, but also me and a lot of people had negative reactions to Bromantane for example, even though its safety and pharmacology has been studied further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very selective memory there. At least a hundred people told me how much they love bromantane, and I&#39;ve heard of dozens of people getting strange side effects from 9mebc. People have said they get side effects from bromantane but they&#39;re normally just feeling tired. The safety of bromantane is confirmed</p>

<p>Also 9mebc&#39;s complete lack of safety testing even in rodents is pretty scary considering it is structurally predicted to be a carcinogen</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going back on my previous comment and yes that was some selective memory. My point is that for all the theories on why 9mebc is risky I have yet to see one really bad experience. What were the strange effects people told you they got from 9mebc? </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I’ve heard a ton of people both love and hate (or just not get any benefit) Bromantane. It seems to me to be an even split. Sure the effects are usually nothing drastic (usually demotivated, tired, anhedonic) and they go away. But still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If bromantane didn&#39;t work it wouldn&#39;t be so insanely popular with hardly any marketing push. A lot of the non responders aren&#39;t using the EC nasal spray version as well, which greatly enhances bioavailability.</p>

<p>Bad experiences I&#39;ve heard of were 1-2 accounts experiencing psychotic episodes (typical of MAOIs), rashes, headaches, dysphoria and likely some I&#39;m leaving out. Keep in mind I&#39;ve been around for a while so I&#39;ve heard it all. I&#39;m not saying anecdotes such as these are proof of anything, but I&#39;m saying that they have indeed occurred, which is typical of any substance.</p>

<p>I hold my stance that anecdotes aren&#39;t as important as controlled studies, and drugs are not toys. People should approach these things with utmost caution, especially since there is no reason to use 9mebc over any other MAOI since all of its purportedly positive effects in studies and anecdotes carry over 1:1 from either MAO-AI or MAO-BI.</p>

<p>If it is a carcinogen, like predicted on protox or admetlab II (and keep in mind, this is grasping at straws because there is NO safety data), then anecdotes simply wouldn&#39;t suffice.</p>
