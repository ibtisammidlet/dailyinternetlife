        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I suffer from depression and social anxiety for years and failed many treatments with having tried 3 therapies (depth-analytical, CBT) &amp; over 14 meds. Nothing worked.</p>

<p>I‘m looking for a possible herb/supp that might be an alternative for my treatment-resistant condition. Found two already:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bacopa enhances my memory</li>
<li>Gotu Kola stabilizes my mood/anxiety</li>
<li>looking for other helpful assistants, so please name your favs :)</li>
</ul>

<p>What are others that have a profoundly significant and noticeable effect on you?</p>

<p>Very interested in: ALCAR, SAM-e, 5-HTP, Tongkat Ali, Skullcap, Magnolia Bark, Lemon Balm, Mulungu, Ginseng, Curcumin/Turmeric, Apigenin, Lions Mane, Saffron, Wild Lettuce, Akuamma, Ginseng, Polygala, Cordyceps.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What&#39;s your experience with it? What do you take it for, what effects do you get (mood/depression, anxiety, sociability/talkativeness, energy/drive, stress/relaxation, cognition, sleep etc.). </p></li>
<li><p>At what dose and what brand/product?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it work used only on occasion / if needed? I mean must it be taken daily so it builds up in your system until it can and does work (similar as antidepressants)? Or is it something that works right away and can be felt after first time dosing? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks a lot! &lt;3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was doing 5-HTP for a while, and it works, but I do not recommend for long term. It starts to unbalance your other neurotransmitters. I went down a rabbit hole of trying to add other stuff to balance it out but ultimately it was too much work and I need my brain to function every day. I stopped about a month ago and will probably not re-try it.</p>

<p>Tongkat Ali, I like. I take it daily. Enhances energy and maybe mood a tiny bit. Increases libido and sexual performance as well.</p>

<p>Have you looked at Ashwagandha? That’s my #1 for controlling anxiety. Works well, no long term negatives that I can tell. I’ve been taking it for more than a year. </p>

<p>Magnesium is also good for lowering anxiety. Magnesium L-threonate is the most bioavailable I’ve found and works well. Helps with muscle cramping too.</p>

<p>My new anti-anxiety helper that I’m still excited about is Mexidol. You can buy it on Amazon. Works well for anxiety and has other systemic anti-inflammatory effects. No downside yet that I can tell. </p>

<p>For cognitive boost/maintenance, I like lion’s mane mushrooms, L-theanine, and a tiny bit of cdp-choline a few times a week. I’ve also been trying out NMN nicotinamide the past few days and things seems a little “brighter”. Still in experimental phase with that one.</p>
