        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how this works and I&#39;m definitely not an expert.</p>

<p>But I recently quit nicotine cold turkey. And I&#39;m two weeks clean now. I&#39;m cool with the cravings, I fight to concentrate on work but I can mostly force myself most of the time. The problem is that I can&#39;t sleep and I get constant headaches.</p>

<p>The sleep is one thing because even magnesium glycinate which used to do wonders for my sleep right before I quit stopped working. I tried adding in some glycine, melatonin and no noticeable improvements, this is been going on for about 5 days now. I feel sleepy or tired throughout the day except nootropics are in effect, but when I eventually crash, it only lasts about an hour or two at most.</p>

<p>The second thing is the constant headaches. I&#39;ve had headaches before and they feel different depending on what might be wrong. I&#39;ve mostly been acquainted with choline overload or deficit headaches I think and this feels just the same. Just a dull constant ache that sometimes has pulses of sharp pain with waves of increasing intensity depending on how much physical movement l&#39;m succumbing my head to or stimulation im exposing my eyes or ears to.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed if I supplement with cholinergics the headache reduces for a while. But that doesn&#39;t last very long.</p>

<p>I guess my question is how does this work really? And what can I do besides waiting it out. Are these headaches because my brain somehow got used to the choline I was feeding it through nicotine, and now it&#39;s finding it hard to produce it&#39;s own?</p>

<p>Should I even be supplementing with choline if that&#39;s the case?</p>

<p>Any information would be helpful. I&#39;d just like to understand what&#39;s happening and anything that could help me through the process would be most appreciated.</p>

<p>Oh I guess it&#39;s worth to mention my source of nicotine was through vapes.</p>

<p>Update: 
Just wanted to say my sincere thanks to everyone that helped.  I feel much much better now. </p>

<p>What helped? This stack every morning:
Rhodiola rosea 
Nac every morning and when I felt headaches come in. It definitely helped with cravings too. 
L-tyrosine 
Phosphatidylserine </p>

<p>Let me add I worked out every morning and had to fight through only getting 2 hours of sleep every night for about 3-4 weeks. Staying active definitely helped keep my mind off the cravings as well. </p>

<p>I noticed I have to be more sensitive to my environment to get enough sleep these days, even when I’m extremely tired. Low temperature, low light and low sound environment, else it’ll just be disturbed. If I had to describe it I’d say I slept like a log anytime I wanted before, now I sleep like a guard dog, awake with the slightest movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d give Paradise Herbs Rhodiola extract a shot— it’s one of the very few that has <em>both</em> rosavins and salidrosides, and raises serotonin and catecholamines in balanced amounts.</p>

<p>It also raises function of acetylcholine (and has acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects), endorphins, NMDA/glutamate modulation, and acts as an adaptogen to restore proper HPA, energy, and cognition after addiction— all of which are basically the mortal enemy of nicotine withdrawal.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24264566/">To top it off, just found out it also modulates nicotinic receptor function, and helps prevent both desire and reinstatement of use</a> which makes even more sense for why it’s worked so brilliantly for me and anyone willing that I’ve thrown it at for quitting lmao.</p>

<p>Final part would just be some NAC to restore proper function of glutamate antiporters (which nicotine/addiction derange) to prevent relapse and demolish cravings— all while cleaning up the lungs and restoring lost glutathione from chronic smoking.</p>

<p>Best of luck friend— 2 weeks in and you’ll seriously wonder how smoking ever seemed like a fair trade for how fantastic you feel :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot! I was using the Rhodiola from double wood and it helped with energy, I’m not sure it helped with much else. I’ll definitely give Paradise Herbs a try. And how could I forget NAC. It’s just beautiful, really. I can’t believe I didn’t mention it in my post but it’s hands down what has helped me the most so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I wake up 4-5 times a week. 500 mg. 
Sometimes I take it when I need it - splitting headaches or an itch in my throat that feels like the oncoming of an allergy or cold. Works wonders dude!</p>

<p>Start cerobrolysin and donepezil, then alpha gpc, uridine and piracetam. The gist of the video is that you need more choline and neuroplasticity to easily quit vaping/smoking. </p>

<p>Gonna try this myself some time in the future, in the meantime I&#39;m still vaping but slowly lowering my nicotine. Was on 10mg nicsalts 3 months ago and I&#39;m now vaping on 6mg and 4.5mg base nicotine.</p>
