    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s tons out there but most don&#39;t really &quot;work&quot; in my experience. While I&#39;m sure a lot of noots out there do make a less noticable different I still feel like a lot of people benifit a lot more from the placebo effect then they realize. Just something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>With that said these are the compounds I think made the biggest difference in my experience. </p>

<p>Supplements:</p>

<p>L-tyrosine 
Magnesium
Zinc
Omega 3-6-9
Vitamin B 6-9-12 + D</p>

<p>None of the nootropics are gonna work well if your deficient in these vitamins since they&#39;re all used in neurotransmitter production and signaling. Honestly within a few weeks makes a bigger difference then any single noot. </p>

<p>Nootropics:</p>

<p>A+
Noopept nasal spray - for acute focus 
Selegiline + modafinil low dosage for energy &amp; motivation
Donepezil for memory hands down. Tried after noticing reduction in ADHD symptoms from Huperzine-A. 
Cialis - use it for muscle building, pumps, increased testosterone &amp; of course ED</p>

<p>B+
Caffeine 
Bromantane
Uradine monophosphate 
Creatine
Racetams
NAC 
L-theanine </p>

<p>I also use nebivolol as it lowers heart rate and stress slightly &amp; a few other compunds to boost test without shutting down productions naturally</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DYOR don’t take random stuff people recommend without understanding what it does and what to be careful about or look out for while doing said stuff. </p>

<p>I recommend looking into bromantane and for sure Alcar. I personally like alpha gpc and uridine monophosphate but they don’t provide a permanent benefit and a lot of people disagree so look into it yourself and decide how to continue. SirSad has a lot of resources and citations. If you don’t understand them fully chat gpt is your friend. Don’t 100% depend on it to think for you, but it can help you understand harder sources more easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>TLDR:</strong>
- Individual responses can vary greatly
- Clearly define your goals, whether short-term or long-term
- <strong>Always</strong> do your own research, don&#39;t be lazy and rely on anecdotes
- Also don&#39;t over-rely on science; despite what many would have you believe, we don&#39;t have it all figured out...
- Manage your expectations: IME, very few noots even approach the strength of pharmaceuticals (EC does have some interesting ones, but they&#39;re behind an &quot;application barrier&quot;)
- (cont.) Prepare to be disappointed and underwhelmed with the majority of stuff out there</p>

<p>All the references and science don&#39;t really mean jack if your personal biochemistry is altered or simply different/incompatible. Many variables are likely responsible, which are too numerous to list (e.g., environment, air quality, climate, exposure to extreme and/or chronic stress, current/previous infections, etc.).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that no/minimal response indicates any sort of damage. While <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> does a superb job of researching the various substances EC carries, the reality is that a good deal of pharmacology and/or biochemistry is not well understood.</p>

<p>As a result, the mechanism of action (MoA) for many substances is the result of hypothesizing, and/or drawing inferences or &quot;likely explanations/conclusions.&quot; Basically what doctors typically do: educated guessing.</p>

<p>Some individuals, unfortunately, simply fall into the category of non-responders or even chronic non-responders (aka they&#39;re &quot;treatment resistant&quot;). Trust me, just b/c the <strong>current</strong> science says &quot;x substance should produce &#39;y&#39; effect(s)&quot; doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>
