    <div class="md"><p>There certainly can be. But honestly from mine and other people’s experiences that I’ve read, we barely get any side effects at all. All that I experienced was a slight increased sensitivity to getting sunburnt but that was about it. Obviously it numbs your mouth a bit if you do it sublingually but I got used to it after a few days and had no taste loss.</p>

<p>As far as MAOi side effects- absolutely 0. I’m still eating just as I did before with absolutely no trouble.</p>

<p>I would watch out for supplementing with methyl donors while taking it though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is an MAOi, albeit a reversible one. It’s pretty potent on MAO-A but fairly weak on MAO-B. Read up on the compound itself as well as on MAOis, I’m sure you’ll find it interesting. I can’t find the post right now that talked about it in detail, but avoiding supplementation of methyl donors should in theory eliminate 9mebc’s metabolism into a neurotoxin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I watched and read a little bit and find some conflicting things like one person that said </p>

<p>“5ht3 antagonism causes constipation. NMDA antagonism causes psychosis. Nicotinic 7 receptor antagonism inhibits nearly all forms of cognition involved in learningLastly, there&#39;s a possibility of addiction in some individuals. Just take a break from stimulants don&#39;t rely on memantine” </p>

<p>I also find some people say it works good for them and some people say it makes them feel worse and that it is also a dissociative sort of like low dose ketamine. Idk lots of conflicting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think it just helped my brain recover from a lot of excitotoxicity from coming off benzos too rapidly and having seizures. like it restored my brain to normal health or something. it also has quieted my mind to a large degree so it’s like my brain has more bandwidth to be utilized in a more productive capacity. ex. less occupied with anxious, ego-driven thought chatter, more space and freedom to imagine things visually, if that makes sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a muscle that atrophied. If someone is born naturally skinny it doesn’t mean their muscles atrophied or they were born completely without them. It just means they have to work twice as hard to look like the person genetically predisposed to being muscular. Everyone is born different but it does not mean we are born completely missing what others have. Maybe it was a poor analogy to grasp but if one person is capable then so is everyone else. As different as we are, we are all the same. You are only incapable when you believe yourself to be because you bought into the idea of something like aphantasia when you struggled at what came easy to others. Give someone with aphantasia a psychedelic and tell me they see absolutely nothing at all. Have someone with aphantasia really practice deep meditation and tell me they saw nothing in all of their practice because I guarantee they did to both which means they aren’t born without the ability it’s there and just has to be practiced.</p>
