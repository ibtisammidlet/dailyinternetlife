        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone else here have any experiences?</p>

<p>When I used Science Bio I felt great, but since I&#39;ve been using the one from Nootropic source (at a 30mg dose rather then 10mg dose), I&#39;ve been getting constantly pulsing of blood in parts of brain, brain dog, and constant ringing in my ears, even a couple weeks after the last dose.</p>

<p>Anyone has any suggestions? I want to do another round, but with Science Bio stock, but they&#39;re not shipping international orders which sucks so badly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so desperate. The last time I did it for like 2 weeks with the Sci Bio stock and it reversed a lot of amps abuse anhedonia. And I feel so much better.</p>

<p>This time around I only used the Nootropic Source higher dose probably like 4 times, like once every two weeks. And since then I&#39;ve definitely felt improvement in my focus abilities which has been really nice, but these side effects are worrying me, and I don&#39; want to use it again if I can get hold of Sci Bio stock.</p>

<p>(Bromantane, even from everychem, has not helped me at all really, sad times. Cere did, but not as much as I need, I&#39;m so desperate to get back a bit more of myself).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those side effects are definitely worrying, though I wonder how you still got the benefits of better focus as well. I got mine from Pure Rawz and did not experience this at all. I had also tried some from Swiss Chems and didn’t experience any side effects beside a little bit of photosensitivity.</p>

<p>Edit: going back and reading your post, the 30 mg dosage is definitely significantly higher compared to your 10 mg dosing as you previously did. This could honestly be the culprit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend Swiss chems or science.bio, kinda pricey but at least you are probably getting real 9-me-bc. I used to order peptides from nootropic source but they are pretty shit. Stopped using them after I found out they dissolve their bromantane in alchohol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love science bio but since it’s been re opened they won’t ship to the UK. </p>

<p>Deeply sad times, I’m so desperate to keep healing since the last science bio batch healed so much and has been the only thing that seems to have worked at all (recovering from amphs abuse). </p>

<p>Any chance you could post me some to the UK? I’d pay you double the cost plus postage. Sorry to ask, I’m trying to get some sci bio stuff before the desperation beats out and makes me go back to the nootropic course 9-me-bc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No wonder why, I has scary side effects even at 10mg, and at 5mg occasionally too. I cant imagine 30mg. </p>

<p>Wdym that youre in constant state of pre-psychosis? The fact that it&#39;s been two months is concerning, it should be out of your system by now</p>
