Sometimes I feel bad sometimes I feel good. Just when I feel like it doesn’t work it shows a little bit of itself working. Strange for sure.</p>

<p>Edit: should have clarified by saying more harm to dopamine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t see in any way how it could “do more harm” as in damage to your brain. There’s no way.
However, negative side effects can certainly happen. Me for example: makes me completely lazy and unmotivated, almost sedated in a way. Kinda makes me feel like i don’t care about anything for a few hours until the effects go away. It like feels bad to even walk around and move, really really strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried it about 5 different times. The first few I took it for a few weeks hoping positive effects would come by but they never did. It always just kept me in that cloud of “life sucks and is boring” kinda thing. The other 2 times I just tried it for a day or 2 because of the hype that I read on it while trying it with different substances. I still never had any success with it whatsoever.
9mebc is much, much better in my experience as to do what it’s “supposed” to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be far less concerned about the three noted, &quot;one off&quot; adverse events (AEs) than the countless positive anecdotes regarding IN bromantane were I considering giving it a try. While it&#39;s always a good idea to use caution when exploring new substances, I feel that you&#39;re giving far too much weight to anecdotes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned from personal experience (and via repeated advice) to perform as much independent research on new/unknown substances as possible. Then, after I have some understanding of how &quot;x&quot; substance is supposed to work and what it <em>may</em> do for me, I take anecdotes into account.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that in most cases (I&#39;m guessing, but I&#39;d be shocked were I wrong), people are not taking these substances in isolation (they&#39;ll usually specify if that&#39;s the case). We also have no idea what other medical and/or psychiatric issues people may have going on. Not saying they&#39;re worthless, but possibly of questionable value, all things considered.</p>

<p>Sometimes this works the other way around, wherein certain anecdotes will pique my curiosity and/or interest. That said, independent research is a necessity regardless. If you&#39;re not familiar with how to read the basics of a medical study, I&#39;d get familiar (there&#39;s a pinned post in this sub that should give you a starting point).</p>

<p>Edit: for the record, I use IN bromantane daily. Typically 3-6 sprays, but it varies. No significant side effects, but I do feel a bit more tired / fatigued than normal when it wears off; if I have the time, I&#39;ll dose 2x a day. This can present as sleepiness sometimes, though poor sleep schedule is equally at fault.</p>

<p>Helps with wakefulness, physical/cognitive fatigue, more confident in general. These effects are subtle, but they are present. They&#39;re more prominent when you first start using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the real risk at least for me is my spraying it wrong or just having too much mucus that doesn&#39;t allow the spray to work. Because sometimes the spray works super well and I can immediately tell, other times my nose refuses to absorb. </p>

<p>idk I&#39;m just a mess when it comes to spring Consistancy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spraying technique is absolutely critical to deliver a consistent dose. And dosing consistently is crucial for getting the desired effect. It’s possible to waste most of the bromantane. It can run out the nose or run down the throat (where the much smaller amounts used intra-nasally will have negligible oral effect). And since much smaller quantities are necessary to get the same effects intra-nasally, one spray too many can mean getting way too much bromantane absorbed. Either way, too little leads to no effect, and too much leads to side effects. I suspect at least some of the negative reports from intra-nasal use actually relate to faulty technique. People just need to be aware that using this sprayer can really be tricky, but it can be done. It is necessary to prime the sprayer and it is sometimes wasteful to do so, but think of how much you are saving compared to taking it orally. And it can be a pain to lean your head back and roll it around in order to get the oily mist to adhere to the sinuses. But once you get the technique down, it’s easy. A little patience and research goes a long way. I think it’s worth it. It saves money and is a much more effective ROA for me (and many others) than oral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That’s a sign the fluid has travelled too far. Ideally, you want a mist to evenly coat the insides of the sinus cavities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people (usually when we talk about somewhat popular substances that would be minority) may just have varying negative responses to different substances. </p>

<p>For example I think Tropisetrone gave me a headache and low BP and that is likely to my weird genes. </p>

<p>But Bromantane for example is amazing for me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say that wide majority of people should not have any bad side-effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t let the caprylic acid run down the back of your throat. Make sure to use the spray correctly. There is risk of it really irritating the respiratory tract and actually might cause disruption of mucous production and coughing for quite some time afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it does dry out my throat and eyes a little shortly after dosing. If I don’t sit with my head back and really get it in there, which typically ends up with a little going down my throat, it just leaks out of my nose. I thought the point of using caprylic acid was that it’s not bad for you. They sell supplements of it and it’s found in coconut, supposed to be anti fungal, anti inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial among other things. Or does that not apply to how it’s being used?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s all about dosage. 400mg is the standard dosage but I usually take 200-250mg. No strong robotic feeling but if I’m doing stuff that’s very tedious then feeling a bit more robotic may be good so I’ll up the dosage. Don’t sleep on TAK-653 either. When I was taking 1mg/day it was okay but now that I’m consistently taking 2mg, I’m definitely noticing the benefits.</p>
