        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can‘t find any info about it except at very few and unofficial websites or forums that say it‘s „illegal to sell or buy but legal to possess“. This is all unofficial information and I also can‘t find a away to contact the Italian customs to ask questions like these. </p>

<p>I will travel to Italy via plane and I have Kava as powder in an opened but (with „Kava“, short description and price tag) labeled bag. Will there be any issues? Also because probably no one at the airport knows what Kava is and the powder does surely look
 kind of suspicious. </p>

<p>This + the question if it‘s even legal there and at what point / amount they will claim I don‘t only use it for own private use and possession but also sell it?</p>

<p>I now really don‘t know if I should bring it to Italy via airplane at all but I also do kind of really need it as I‘m withdrawing from Kratom then (as Kratom is illegal in Italy) and want to taper my prescribed Pregabalin at the same time (because I‘ve used it daily for almost 2 weeks now which I never wanted to, instead only wanted to use it as needed every 3-4 days as I only have good and consistent effects if I do so). </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure if this will help you but, I had kratom from inside the EU delivered to me in italy. No package checks will happen that way. Saved my butt. If you know where you will be staying, you could order it there? Or maybe put kratom capsules in another herbal supplement container. I think you could put kratom in the kava bag. </p>

<p>Either way, I think you’re probably overestimating how closely these kind of things are checked. They don’t care, they’re not gonna check to make sure your kava is kava etc unless you are bringing in kilos of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will even only be 2 days in Italy but then Switzerland. In both countries it‘s illegal and I will probably get through 2 days off Kratom when I’m in Italy by still using Pregabalin, but hell I‘m sure as hell in hellishly puristic Switzerland they will check your package and sue you.</p>

<p>But thank you! For Italy (as it also is EU im comp to Switzerland) it would probably work. Forgot to mention Switzerland, that would have been important, too, I guess haha…</p>

<p>But still anyways I would never ever risk getting sued for Kratom by putting it into the Kava bag or some other vitamin or herb capsules as I already got in legal trouble once for supplements and I never wanna go through that for a legal substance again. Very careful now. While Kratom on the other side even IS an illegal drug in both, Switzerland and Italy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you got in trouble! If it’s through the way I mentioned, perhaps because you only have carryon backpack etc, thats horrible. Extremely rare but I could understand not wanting to go through it again. </p>

<p>But if not, ive recapsuled supplements and rebagged them too, into something benign, if you only have enough capsules for a short while it should be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats a carryon backpack? Tbh it was because I had Phenibut with me in my car, when I was controlled and they tested me for it in Switzerland (ofc only because they saw the bag of Phenibut, otherwise they won‘t test randomly for Phenibut). Then they decided I was having a DUI like case as there was active Phenibut in my blood. They do also test for Kratom (regularly, not randomly) in Switzerland but luckily this one was under the active level to find in my blood as I consumed it only another day before (thanks god). </p>

<p>It was kind of strange as I didn‘t know Phenibut will ever be an issue or a DUI. Plus it was a conflict between the state court / public prosecution department (they said Phenibut is legal so it‘s no issue and I‘m fine so I won‘t get in any trouble) and the freakin traffic department - dont know how it‘s called in english - said IT IS a DUI in contrary to the state‘s opinion but yeah as in traffic cases the traffic department is &gt; the state in Switzerland their opinion was valid and I had a loooot of psychological stress, sleepless nights, attorney contact and finally a fee of 2000 CHF and lost my right to drive (only) in Switzerland (as it‘s not EU so a driving forbiddance from Swiss department will only mean forbiddance ro drive in Switzerland). 10/10 regret having the Phenibut labeled bag with me in my car and driving with it while I never thought I‘d do something wrong or illegal by that…</p>
