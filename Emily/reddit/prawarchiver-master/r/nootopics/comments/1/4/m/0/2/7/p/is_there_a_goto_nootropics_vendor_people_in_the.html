        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I desperately need a vendor people with nootropics definitely trust so I can determine if the issue is more me or a vendor problem.  Any links that might tell me so far are private and not letting me in. Anything else is a lot of back and forth good and bad experiences. I assumed there must be at least 1 go to vendor for people but doesn&#39;t seem to be the case?</p>

<p>Not so much looking for supplements but for the medicational noots. Have plenty of supplements already. Things like racetams, memantine, bromantine,  Sunifiram, obviously modafinil and the other related derivatives, even the more experimental meds. etc. etc. etc.  Is what I am looking for at this point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to get off Adderall and onto Modafinil (with strattera, already started strat). But long term Adderall/Dexedrine use has down regulated the heck out of my brain and screwed up my endocrine system so there is a process of repair while transitioning. Definitely dependent on amphetamine but not addicted.  I say that because I have no addiction withdrawal symptoms. Don&#39;t feel sick, zero cravings for amp, no parkinsons like shaking etc. Just tired, unfocussed, unmotivated, and grump. Didn&#39;t take amp for a week and only did  to be functional enough to be on the net for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Problem is, the stuff I purchased from umbrellalabs did squat for me (aside from the worst rash I&#39;ve ever had in my life. So Idra-21 may be legit LOL). Don&#39;t have prior experience so can&#39;t say for sure if I am just so downregulated that Phenylpiracetam (300mg), Sunifiram (30mg), Noopept, and Fladrafinil (200mg) are like placebos except for mild  Tachycardia.  I expected at least some waking affect from Fladrafinil considering they prescribe modafinil to meth-heads in rehab to help with withdrawal symptoms. I&#39;m not even close to meth-head damage so would expect some bump in the minimum from Fladrafinil. Mounjaro could mess with those things if they are basic ph and can be effected by stomach acid  but haven&#39;t tried looking up that info yet. Mounjaro delays stomach emptying and is ionizing my adderall and greatly reducing absorption on an empty stomach. Tried those others with and without food. Not all at the same time obviously. And didn&#39;t jump to those mg doses I mentioned right away. Just end up taking naps while listening to my heartbeat in the pillow all day.</p>

<p>Do have 9-Me-BC from umbrellalabs I haven&#39;t tried. Basically the list of foods you shouldn&#39;t eat while on it is basically my list of foods I eat daily so some adjustment is needed first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the U.S. so that may be a factor. Don&#39;t have crypto so some reasonably unconvoluted way for credit card or zelle is necessary.</p>

<p>Losing over $500 a day trying to transition off Adderall since I can&#39;t work. Software engineer so all brain all day. </p>

<p>I did get some stuff from cosmicnootropic. Been taking memantine for a week. Piracetams are good for increasing heart rate but did nothing else for me, even double dosing. Have a couple other things from them I haven&#39;t tried yet. (side note, their free shipping sucks, pay the extra 6 bucks for USPS)</p>

<p>Just to be clear, not expecting to transition meds overnight. Takes a long time to undo down regulation and neurotoxic damage and may never get back to my old baseline. But I should be getting at least a response from meds that I can then work with as I transition. Took 6 months without supplements after being on adderall for 1.5 years the last time. Now 15 years later back on and way farther down the rabbit hole. And yes tried getting help from shrinks already with no success. Unfortunately I know more about adderall than most of them now.  Shrinks 0 for 4 in trying changes. Me 2 for 2 in what I suggested may help. Similar results from endocrinologist, and know more than most of them do about Amp effects on endocrine systems. Which is really annoying when I need them to run blood tests for me and prescribe my meds. Ugghhhh!</p>

<p>I took a look at <a href="https://NootropicsBase.com">NootropicsBase.com</a>.  I&#39;ll stick to cosmicnootropic. They have a lot more meds to choose from. And prices are about the same or better. They don&#39;t have a few things like modafinil or armodafinil. But prices for those are much higher than other sites that sell it. They do have Atomoxet which is Atomoxetine. But it is way to expensive for the amount in each tab. The most common dosage is 80mg and the max dose they sell is 40,  And not idea how it compares to regular prescription strength I would get anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far I have used CosmicNootropics which I like. But my brain is so downregulated from Adderall I don&#39;t get any effect from mild stimulants.  But do feel like other meds are helping to fix Adderall issues faster than without them.</p>

<p>I have now tried Everychem and like it alot so far.  </p>

<p>Question though, what is the proper way to take the EveryChem products that are liquids and provided with a dropper? Is it simply a matter of dropping dose into the mouth and swallowing, should try sublingually then swallow, or mix it with something before eating? Will these liquid mixtures have a negative effect on teeth enamel?   </p>

<p>Bought a bunch from Umbrellalabs at first. Like I mentioned before, don&#39;t seem to do anything. Don&#39;t know if they are just being destroyed in my stomach and not absorbed or what the deal is. Gotta figure taking 130mg of Sunifram would do something considering the normal dosage is about 10mg. etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like their U.S. affiliate is <a href="https://NOOTROPICSBASE.COM">NOOTROPICSBASE.COM</a> which I commented on before.<br/>
They do have some slightly better prices on some offshore items, but that comes with higher shipping cost and 3 to 4 weeks shipping to U.S. If I was planning to stock up on some a lot of a few specific items to offset shipping and didn&#39;t mind waiting longer they might be ok for that. But cosmicnootropic has way more selection and for the U.S. it has taken a week to get. But, they did say I could request direct USPS shipping instead of their regular shipper which would cut off 2 to 4 days.  Downside is cosmic doesn&#39;t have any of the modafinil/armodafinil items.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cosmicnootropic&#39;s US warehouse is down while they find a new vendor to store and ship with. But their international shipping is still there and has lower prices although shipping is like $40 flat fee I think. Buy enough stuff and the reduced prices can make up for the extra shipping costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on my second box of Mexidol. Also been taking a bunch of other things from Russia and a number of other drugs and supplements. They help but it is a very slow process. Been on higher dose Adderall for 15 years straight so between downregulation and damage done, it&#39;s having minimal effect. Everyone posts about various supplements and drugs and how wonderful they are at repotentiating Adderall. But so far disappointed in all of them. Stopped taking Adderall for 2 months and only take it when I need to drive. But very far from being back to pre-medication days. Or just feeling sharp when I do take Adderall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though it sucks that things aren&#39;t working, it is good news since now I know the problem is most likely absorption issues due to  Mounjaro combined with downregulation and damage done from long term Adderall prescription. So now I know not to buy powders. Does suck thought that I have no way of knowing if many of my regular supplements are getting absorbed or not. A lot of powders from bulksupplements among many other capsules, pills, and some liquids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think the issue is more than just absorption due to Mounjaro. Think it is blocking PFC signaling making the meds not work right. My theory GIP and GLP-1 analogs in drugs like Mounjaro cause an accumulation of cAMP.  cAMP can in some cases increase neurotransmitter release. And in others &quot;cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, closing the brain cell to communication and thus interfering with the function of the prefrontal cortex. &quot; So an individual may have positive, negative/ or neutral effects of Mounjaro on their psychoactive medications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know for a fact that Mounjaro affects my Adderall. There is no doubt there. Adderall is a weak base that gets ionized by stomach acid and ionized amphetamine doesn&#39;t absorb well. One day I took Adderall and ate until I was full. It started to kick in in about 45 minutes and was much stronger for the dose than it had been. on the 5mg Mounjaro dosage I can take 80mg of Adderall IR and roll over and go back to bed for 2 hours and have some effect when I make myself get out of bed. At peak blood concentration I have some therapeutic effect but it only lasts 2 or 3 hours and not really enough to be efficient at my job. </p>

<p>Memantine I don&#39;t feel anything from it. Just hope that it is working. Taking 10mg twice a day. Don&#39;t know if I should actually feel anything though. I only take Adderall on days that I need to drive now since I stopped taking it in June. I can get by with less but can&#39;t say how much to attribute to what drug, supplement, or just not being on it for days or weeks at a time.  Strattera I used in the past with Adderall and it repotentiated it. Only found out recently that is likely due to it being a weak NMDA receptor antagonist witch is similar to the nero-protectiveness of Memantine. But Memantine is designed for the job. It took many months for Strattera to repotentiate Adderall so don&#39;t know how long it would take Memantine to help. Only been taking it a month or so. And started back on Strattera 3 months ago. Plus take L-theanine which is also a weak agonist of the NMDA receptor.  No idea if Memantine wins or if they compete.</p>

<p>Taking stuff from everychem and cosmicnootropics on top of the umbrellalabs stuff. Even the nasal sprays from everychecm I don&#39;t really feel anything. Then again, not sure if I am really supposed to feel much or if they are just working. I have the NA Selank and NA Semax and Bomantain sprays from everychem. As well as 3 liquids with dropper ones. Sometimes it feels for a couple minutes like something reached my brain but nothing beyond that. I don&#39;t really feel the stuff from cospic either except the sulbutiamine which makes me sleepy.  I do know that all the supplements and meds I am taking are helping a little since I had stopped taking Adderall before and feel like I am advancing better even though I am much more damaged from it than I was back then. But no way to tell what is working or not since there are too many to sort out.<br/>
Didn&#39;t start nootropic supplements till after I had been on monjaro for a few months and the nootropic drugs only in the last couple months. Without any prior experience, I have nothing to compare to. vitamins, minerals, amino acids, plant extracts, nootropic drugs, etc. all in all I&#39;m taking about 50 give or take a day.   </p>

<p>On Jardiance alone my a1c was 6.7. Adding mounjaro my last blood test was 5.3. pre-diabetes starts at 5.7 for reference. Plus my cholesterol and triglycerides are the best they have ever been, and blood pressure the best in about 20 years. Lost and holding off 30lbs that Adderall tacked on and couldn&#39;t lose. So hard to justify getting rid of the mounjaro unfortunately. But I do need to start working again and don&#39;t know if modafinil/armodafinil will work for me or not to get off Adderall.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Story of my life, anything that helps me always has negative effects to mitigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>curious - why not metformin? </p>

<p>Also, check out Jason Fung - fasting can resensitize the body to insulin. People have reversed diabetes with supervised fasting (can be dangerous for inexperienced but I did regular 4 day fast every three weeks for chemo for awhile - unsupervised and was ok...actually felt so good after my body got used to fasting that it&#39;s a bit of a problem.  Fasting feels so good but I need to keep my weight up so no more for me. But the mental and emotional clarity is amazing once the body becomes metabolically flexible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fasting is very very difficult for me. I have issues with appetite control. Probably something to do with ADHD and not being able to block out stimuli. Even then, I am often hungry even when I have eaten. Fasting for just 1 day  for a medical procedure is a difficult challenge for me. Plus, I have to eat to take Strattera. Without food it makes me nauseous.  But, I do understand the benefits of fasting.<br/>
I did buy some Spermidine which is supposed to  cause autophagy. But then I realized there is a lot of damage done and being done from Adderall, so better to try to promote repair and renew for now till I can get my brain healthy again.</p>

<p>Metformin, a lot of research that says it is good for you, not just for diabetes control. So, would like to take it. But it increased my blood pressure, gave me heart palpitations, diarrhea or loose stools, thing there was more but I forget. Januvia I  had issues with also.</p>

<p>Mental clarity for me is a year or so away. Need to get off Adderall and repair my brain. Right now just to be somewhat functional it takes 400mg modafinil, 350mg armodafinil, 100mg strattera, 60mg adderall, 200mg caffeine, plus my assortment of supplements and low dose experimental drugs .</p>

<p>While on Jardiance and Mounjaro, my blood glucose was better controlled than non-diabetics.  My a1c was down to 5.3.  And my glucose spikes  after meals were lower than a non-diabetic.  Even after not eating for 15 hours, I still didn&#39;t get low blood sugar. My body was able to manage glucose again and with the help of the meds, it was better than decades ago before I was diabetic and more athletic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a theory but,<br/>
Think the issue is more than just absorption due to Mounjaro. Think it is blocking PFC signaling making the meds not work right. My theory GIP and GLP-1 analogs in drugs like Mounjaro cause an accumulation of cAMP in cells (known from drug research).  cAMP can in some cases increase neurotransmitter release. And in others &quot;cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). When cAMP stimulates the HCN, the channels open, closing the brain cell to communication and thus interfering with the function of the prefrontal cortex. &quot; So an individual may have positive, negative, or neutral effects of Mounjaro on their psychoactive medications.  </p>

<p>A long shot solution for those negatively affected.  &quot;guanfacine works by strengthening the regulation of attention and behavior by the prefrontal cortex. These enhancing effects on prefrontal cortical functions are believed to be due to drug stimulation of post-synaptic α2A adrenoceptors on dendritic spines. cAMP-mediated opening of HCN and KCNQ channels is inhibited, which enhances prefrontal cortical synaptic connectivity and neuronal firing.&quot;</p>
