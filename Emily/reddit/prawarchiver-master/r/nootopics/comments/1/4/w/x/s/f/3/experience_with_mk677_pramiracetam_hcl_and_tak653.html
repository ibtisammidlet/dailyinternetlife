        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had low expectations for all of these substances as I&#39;m generally skeptical of nootropics and believe there&#39;s a lot of placebo and deceptive marketing involved. In this post, I&#39;ll share my experiences with these substances and their impact on my pet rat. I&#39;ll list them based on effectiveness and utility.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>MK-677: This substance surprised me the most as it had noticeable effects on my rat. I initially dosed 15mg at night, expecting it to improve my rat&#39;s sleep quality. However, it had a significant appetite-boosting effect. At first, my rat struggled to sleep due to feeling excessively hungry. Eventually, I gave him some delicious peanut butter and cheese, and he consumed around 1000-1200 extra calories. It&#39;s important to note that my rat is an active individual who exercises regularly and is relatively lean. To put it in human terms, he&#39;s 6&#39;2, 187lbs, with a squat of 275lbs, deadlift of 405lbs, bench of 225lbs, 2.5 plate dips, and a weighted pull-up of 70lbs. During use of MK-677, my rat required less sleep to feel well-rested. Normally, he needed around 8-10 hours, but now 7-9 hours were sufficient for him (1 hour of savings adds to whole 7 hours a week). I have read about potential side effects on insulin sensitivity, which makes me cautious about further dosing as my rat&#39;s grandmother had diabetes (if anyone has experience on this matter please advise).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Pramiracetam HCl: This substance had noticeable effects on my rat, but he didn&#39;t enjoy them. It provided a similar sensation to Adderall (my rat is not an active adderall user but had experiences in his college days with it - roughly 4 - 5 years ago), but without the actual focus enhancement. My rat found it difficult to concentrate on reading, writing, studying chess, or doing art. However, it did prove useful for physical activities such as running, walking, and socializing. It seems more suitable for situations that don&#39;t require intense focus, as my rat doesn&#39;t have issues with anxiety or socializing but felt even greater adept at such matters. The initial dose was within the recommended range, but it felt too strong and caused some brain fog, which my rat disliked.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TAK-653: This substance requires a follow-up post as its effects are subtle and challenging to quantify accurately. I will continue using it since it seems to have the least impact and possibly works in more subtle ways. My rat doesn&#39;t appear to behave significantly differently under its effects.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>On a side note, does anyone else feel this way? My rat complained about the horrible taste of all these chemicals. It&#39;s like eating a chemistry set. Surely, there must be a way to make these substances taste delicious for my rat while maintaining their effectiveness?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear u/BigWhat55535,</p>

<p>I appreciate that you&#39;re taking the time to express your thoughts, but I would like to address the tone of your message. While I understand that not every post may capture your interest or resonate with you, it is important to remember that everyone has their own perspectives and reasons for sharing their thoughts. It seems maybe you confused the intent of O.P referring to himself as a rat. The purpose seems to be for humor.</p>

<p>Responding with such a dismissive and rude comment does not contribute to a positive or constructive conversation. Instead, it can be hurtful and discouraging to the person who posted and potentially dissuade them from sharing their ideas in the future. It is crucial to foster an environment of respect and open-mindedness, where diverse opinions and experiences are acknowledged and appreciated.</p>

<p>If you find that a post does not align with your interests, it is perfectly acceptable to move on without leaving negative remarks. By refraining from derogatory comments, we can encourage a more supportive and inclusive online community. Let&#39;s remember to engage in conversations with kindness and empathy.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering these thoughts. I hope we can foster a more positive and respectful atmosphere in our interactions.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Your friend -- P.S: Now stop being a crabby butt. 🥸</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, Borgo, for that. I did find it quite amusing to include the rat experiment (as it seems to be a common theme among websites that sell nootropics - not for human use). However, I realize that humor can sometimes be difficult to convey through text. I must admit, I felt a bit defensive myself when confronted with his negativity, especially considering that the first comment was a negative one. But then again, that&#39;s the nature of the internet. I appreciate your efforts in spreading positivity. Thanks for your contribution!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MK-677 (as I&#39;ve read) is best taken at night if you do not want lethargy or overeating. That matches my experience with my own rat, and it seems that you can take it in the morning, and that the lethargy can allegedly go away as some in the rat steroid using community say. </p>

<p>Apparently it also makes your skin glow, and hair and nails grow faster. My rats skin I believe has gotten better. I think when women say that their skin is &quot;glowing&quot; they mean it looks hydrated, aka a little shiny, and I think my skin has been more like that. </p>

<p>The times my rat has taken MK-677 in a full droppers worth, the rat experienced more anger towards the latter part of the day. MK-677 at 12mg in the morning mad my rat feel different. Maybe more &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;unabashed&quot;, however my rat has trouble expressing this and I have trouble translating. These feels however is not worth the lethargy derived from HGH increases and insulin sensitivity, hence, why you would be thoughtful and give it to your rats at night either 1-3 hours before bed. me and my rat still need to discuss what duration is optimal.</p>

<p>another issue is that my rat has morning responsibilities that have to be attended to and traveled by 8am, and it has not adjusted to it. in fact, it has been waking up at 5:30-6:30 for no reason other than its brain knowing it has work. it has been going to bed at 11-11;30 instead of 9:30-10pm. This it is hard to tell if the reduced sleep duration  of 6-7 hours paired with the deeper sleep MK-677 is known for is helping. I will be happy to see how my rat fares sleep and energy wise once it starts to take it&#39;s responsibilities and health seriously. one day, my rat did get 8 hours of proper sleep, and with mk, felt really good. the best slept in many years. I will discipline my rat soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree I&#39;m going to be tracking my sleep quality more religously to see if it there really is an improvement, I think dosing at night is preferred way. Taking the computer screen or phone screen may help with sleep scheduling your rat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what? lol it’s a insulin needle that’s subq you don’t even feel it lol. Even my girl does it herself Most peptides have to be injected with i repeat, an insulin needle that millions of people use a day for insulin multiple times. That’s the only way and yea you can inject them all at once. The semaglutide is just once a week. Technically cjc/dac can be once a week but i think it’s better to half the dose and take twice a week, I actually think the same with the semaglutide. You just take them with your ghrp there’s literally no difference and you get more constant blood levels plus you’re not injecting a high amount at once. You can replace the ghrp i suppose with the MK, i would just lower dose to like 50mg. I thought that was the normal dose? or am i thinking of something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not running it atm. I just did a stupid long fast and ended with a super strong detox i made. I haven’t ran semaglutide either just my wife but she wasn’t consistent or working out, she’s busy with work a lot. With cjc/dac and GHRP-6 it worked pretty well. I took MK too but i never experienced anything off it. I’ve read through the semaglutide research and they would’ve gotten a hell lot of better results with cjc/dac alone and just make it a single shot. I really haven’t responded to much even high doses of like yk11 or lgd. Same with testosterone. I’ve only ever responded to Dbols and made they made me a freak but damn it thinned my hair out within a month so i stopped and it grew back. If I could say anything it was combo of cjc/dac with ghrp-6 because i would get those spikes with the ghrp and the cjc/dac would just potentiate it. I’ve tried MK i actually have some now, doesn’t do anything for me. I really think if you’re trying to shred semaglutide which i don’t think was expensive idk bout now that the fda has just approved it. But that with cjc/dac and either MK or ghrp-x(whichever doesn’t make you hungry probably 2 or 5 but i was fine on 6) would work nice. I wouldn’t use the semaglutide if you weren’t cutting. The cjc/dac and ghrp especially ghrp-6 can make you hungry so that by itself is good for bulking. Just because you respond to carbs better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok you said 15mg idk why i was thinking you said 1000mg i was like wth. That was calories. Yeah 25mg i think is a good dose for it. Really it doesn’t raise levels that much as claimed nor is it as strong as it says. I think cjc/dac is the best addition to any of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they’re right there is a lot of deception in the nootropics industry - perhaps not the research chemicals themselves, but the people selling them making millions. There is deceptive marketing, phrasing, compounds creation, testing, etc.. so it is a fair point. </p>

<p>Anyway the rat thing seems to have been done in humorous tone obviously - or maybe this kind of fun makes you angry? Huh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure but what’s listed you won’t find on deceptive nootropic sites just trying to take your money. You will only find the basics so a fair point yes but one that doesn’t apply when he’s naming chemicals you only find through research that aren’t being marketed to you. </p>

<p>Anyway we’re in modern times talking about legal substances, not on bluelight talking about drug experiences, so no need to be out of touch.</p>
