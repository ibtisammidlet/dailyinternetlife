    <div class="md"><p>Synthetic Levodopa and the Levodopa contained in Mucuna Pruriens act entirely different within the body. Much lower dosages of Mucuna Pruriens L-Dopa is needed than the synthetic variety. It works longer, safer, and doesn’t seem to cause dyskinesia in patients like RX Sinemet/Carbidopa does. They theorize there are other compounds at play in Mucuna extract which are responsible for the health benefits, compounds which are missing from RX Levodopa. </p>

<p>I take Mucuna Pruriens standardized to 15% L-Dopa every day. It improves my muscle functioning better than opioids or any muscle relaxers I’ve ever tried. But I do have a mild dopaminergic myotonic disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not up on the science but anecdotally I take it a few times a week when I start to get fatigued, depressed, unmotivated. It definitely does seem to help and also has never had any negative side effects for me. I take 1-2 dopa mucuna capsules. I’m pretty sure I have either a significant cyclic mood disorder or a physical ailment that has never shown up on any lab work, but occasionally I just get intensely tired an anhedonic and it can last a long time. My number one goal in life is to prevent that from getting too bad. As of now mucuna is one tool in my arsenal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did mention tyrosine hydroxylase in the video, if I’m not mistaken. I think Ryan has a couple meme-ish things he can say in his videos (particularly him deleting my comments speaking against Uridine, as it’s an anti-dopamine compound). But I have to agree with what he said in this video. I don’t think people will have any terrible effects happening from dosing Mucuna with the recommended dosages here and there.</p>

<p>&quot;L-Dopa (Mucuna Pruriens in supplement form), come with many side effects,[15] so much so that it was unusable in older adults for the purpose of promoting cognition. In fact, it impaired learning and memory and mainly caused side effects.[16]&quot;</p>

<p>Taken from: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/">The complete guide to dopamine and psychostimulants</a></p>

<p>Is it possible that you accidently conflated mucuna pruriens with L-Dopa? And there is more to that [16] study that you cited?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>&#39;In this context, it is also worth mentioning that the vast majority, if not all, of the studies showing plasticity- and learning-enhancing properties of L-dopa and its impact on dopamine levels consistently report larger effects in cases when dopaminergic structures are either lesioned or degenerated8,22,32. This may also point to the possibility that the negative effects observed in our study of healthy adults could be mediated by biological effects independent of dopaminergic neurotransmission. On the other hand, with this background, it is difficult to argue that the fact that we examined older adults explains why our results are in conflict with the previous ones showing positive effects of L-dopa on younger adults’ learning7,21. That is, if anything, one would expect even more positive effects of L-dopa supplementation on learning in older populations compared to the ones reported in healthy younger individuals, since age-related degeneration of dopaminergic circuits is a very well established observation16,17,33. An explanation for the mixed results could instead be that L-dopa may exhibit differential effects on learning in different cognitive domains. In the previous two longitudinal studies of repeated L-dopa administration the positive effects were demonstrated on world learning, which rather pertains to episodic memory domain, whereas the main domains studied in the present study was working memory and executive functions. This interpretation may also be in line with the findings from a recent study showing detrimental effects of L-dopa on reward reversal learning in younger and older healthy adults, which were of the same magnitude irrespective of initial cognitive performance and expected baseline dopamine levels34.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t read any of the above discussion yet so excuse my two cents if it’s been brought up.</p>

<p>But this is just based on my knowledge of neurobiology generally. I’ve come to the conclusion the rapid tolerance probably is related to AADC. I haven’t taken it forever but I planned on taking bromantane after to see if theres a normalization of enzymes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I’ve used Mucuna Pruriens for about 2 months, upwards of 2,000mg standardized to 20% L-dopa, and experienced a very bad withdrawal after coming off them. But, I did cease Mucuna abruptly and took quite a bit(about 400mg L-dopa). The comedown was intense and is still kind of ongoing. It’s been 6 weeks so I’ll have to wait this out and see what happens. I suspect I may have downregulated something because the first week was the worst but it got progressively better as the weeks went on.</p>
