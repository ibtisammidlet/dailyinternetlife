        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I finally managed to get a hold of it in my country.</p>

<p>It was so hard to dose this. I was using a 0.000g scale but in the end I calibrated it perfectly to give me 20mg as my dose. (0.020g)</p>

<p>T:00:30</p>

<p>In half an hour I started to feel something different but I couldn’t quite put my hands on it. Something definitely has changed. I’m generally an anxious person due to years of GABAergic abuse so this made me ever so slightly anxious.</p>

<p>T:01:00</p>

<p>I started to feel slightly warm and pleasant. I have hardly taken any stims at all but this is what 15mg of adderall feels like. It is a little reminiscent without being that pushy.</p>

<p>T:02:00</p>

<p>I’m feeling great at this point. Everything I do or watch or listen to is just enhanced. Even if I watch an Instagram reel that usually I would just skip past is really enjoyable. This would be great for people with anhedonia type symptoms. Definitely an urge to socialise. Anxiety has completely vanished and the thought of it makes me laugh.</p>

<p>T:03:00</p>

<p>Obvious hypomania. I start making my way to the shops to do some shopping and I put the radio on Capital Dance (People from the UK would know) My jaw is starting to wobble a little bit so I reach for some chewing gum. I’m walking and I’m looking at everyone in the eyes. I feel like I look crazy so I look down whilst I walk. Music is starting to sound amazing. For those of you that have done LSD. There is a dopaminergic push that the LSD gives you which feels warm, fuzzy, music sounds great and your skin feels great. It is reminding me of the dopaminergic aspects of LSD over anything else… interesting.. I wonder if the same dopamine receptors are involved. Randomly start cleaning things that I’ve put off around the house. Notice I’m doing this a little aggressively. When I’m cleaning or doing something for some reason, I want to get it done as fast as possible, almost in a competitive way. I’ve never had this before but then again, I don’t take stims so stim
fiends might be able to relate.</p>

<p>T:04:00</p>

<p>It’s not getting any weaker. Also noticing memory recall. Even when a slight noise or song reminds me of a past event, it reminds me of it even if it happened over 10 years ago. When I was shopping, I heard the intro to the “Hello moto” ringtone from someone’s phone a couple of yards away. Just the intro of the song sent me years back to when I had a Motorola with the same ringtone like wtf lmao. And who the hell still has a motorola?? </p>

<p>T:04:30</p>

<p>Previous effects more pronounced and stronger. I feel like this is the peak. A slight hint of anxiety as well.</p>

<p>T:05:00</p>

<p>Very gradual coming down.. notice my paragraphs are getting smaller as I wrote this live and realise it was quite strong.</p>

<p>T:06:00</p>

<p>I feel like there’s only a slight background effect but feel more sober.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>This felt more recreational/hedonic than nootropic. For nootropic purposes, there’s better options. If you want a good time without it being too damaging and a mood boost, this is for you.</p>

<p>If you’re suffering from anhedonia, this is I believe absolutely fantastic. Especially those you have previously fucked up their dopamine from drug use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this for a while as an anhedonic! It&#39;s seems very interesting... <strong>BUT</strong> my concern has been if there is any notable tolerance and withdrawal after long-term usage with PPAP.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard from a few others that say they don&#39;t notice withdrawal or a tolerance besides &quot;behavioral adaptation,&quot; which feels like a slight tolerance, but it&#39;s just one getting used to what they&#39;re taking (not the same as tolerance like receptor downregulation / upregulation). Though this happens with anything taken in the long term, although some are less suspectable to this based upon their mindset and/or previous baseline. I wish I could get more feedback from these people to get more info (how long they used PPAP, dosages, etcetera), but sadly, they are now unresponsive.</p>

<p>If you do (or anyone else that reads this) decide to take this in the mid to long term (at least a consistent 2 or 3 weeks and up), please give us feedback! Anecdotes would be great for us anhedonics!! </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I am not asking you to test this on yourself. I&#39;m just saying that if you ever did do it on your own terms, the anecdote would be very appreciated!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I just want to let you know that I have taken fairly large doses (40-60mg) for weeks-months continually, ran out and suffered zero I’ll effects. Just the lack of the stimulation PPAP gave. I think it’s a pretty forgiving substance.</p>

<p>I also want to know whether anybody has had it cause a false positive in a drug test before? I’m asking because I’ve seen it brought up as a theoretical possibility due to its relationship to selegeline, but wanted to hear if there were any real experiences with drug tests after taking PPAP. Specifically pre-employment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My response is far too late, but I was in outpatient rehab (benzo addiction) for 2 months and PPAP was no problem. I would dose two—four times a day (on a particularly boring day and it never popped. Note that I also was scripted Dexmethylphenidate so I don’t know if that might have skewed what they tested for and/or what I would pop for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been using it most days for the last 2 months. I do notice that my dosage has increased over this time, while not needed to feel an effect I do take a higher dose some days to increase the effects of it. I&#39;ve tried it orally, sublingual, insufflation and vaping it, and have ended up doing insufflation for the last month. There are a few things I would say about long term use of it.</p>

<p>When it is used in high doses (I&#39;m not sure how much exactly, but definitely more than 100mg) it can feel very much like an amphetamine, and the side effects are similar (insomnia, sweating, no appetite, muscle tension). I have on a few occasions used a large amount in one day, and this resulted in a bout of nausea and vomiting after it wears off. I assume this is due to having a large amount of it in your stomach, not eating or drinking, and as it&#39;s so acidic it will cause stomach issues in large dosages. It causes irritation and then numbing when taken too, which is reminiscent of both cocaine and certain amphetamines strangely. I&#39;ve had experience with most stimulants, and it feels like a more controlled version of these. I&#39;ve had occasions where I begin to get anxious on it, but once I change my train of thought to something less anxiety causing, it instantly goes away. </p>

<p>In regards to tolerance or withdrawal, tolerance has definitely occurred. It&#39;s still very stimulating, but less euphoric, possibly hinting at down regulation of dopamine which I&#39;ll have to address at some stage. It also seems to reinforce whatever dopamine releasing behaviours that occur on it, which can be good or bad depending on the user and their habits. I&#39;ve had days (like after over doing it and causing vomiting) where I have not used it for 2 or 3 days, and have not noticed any withdrawal symptoms, just a feeling that I don&#39;t have the enhanced dopamine release. It&#39;s a strange but useful substance. I&#39;ve also used other stimulants on it, and it definitely increases their action and duration. </p>

<p>I hope this gives you a bit more information, and if there&#39;s any other questions feel free to ask!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We often tend to underestimate how much experience and knowledge people here are lacking. More often than not, they actually only spread misinformation. You also can&#39;t trust they are themselves correct measuring devices or experiments for such.</p>

<p>That is especially with this true. Because 1: its via an entire novel/understudied mechanism. And 2: it has a big cross over with recreational drugs, so you could easentially experienct vastly polarized, opposing reactions fron that allone</p>

<p>I would sure appreciate it if you would also let us know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Did it affect your physical balance at all, positive, negative, no effect?</p></li>
<li><p>What ROA did you use, and did you take it with anything else like a caffeine source or food or other?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) There was no effect to my balance whatsoever</p>

<p>2.) Oral and just an empty stomach. No other drugs or nootropics were taken, not even caffeine.</p>

<p>I’ve heard taking it with caffeine can cause anxiety but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Hope that helps :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have both and I would say there are better options out there for these issues.</p>

<p>It would help but nootropics like Bromantane and Tropisetron are better for social anxiety.</p>

<p>I would say PPAP would be better for getting into the flow of conversations and making them more fun, everything is more humorous so you’d be cracking more jokes and generally smiling more and  in a happier mood.</p>

<p>For PTSD, I would say it would give temporary relief yes.</p>

<p>PPAP is way more “obvious” and stronger than most things I’ve tried before.</p>

<p>I would say try other things first for these issues as PPAP is way too euphoric in my opinion to be used daily or as a cure. </p>

<p>For temporary relief.. sure.</p>

<p>Long term use… I wouldn’t advise it tbh. Especially as it’s quite unknown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally can recommend Selank and Semax injections. Much better overall effect, almost painkiller like, but no stupefaction, that regular painkillers from any store give me. The comedown usually was just mega sleepiness at around 8 pm. I feel child-like on those Ruski compounds. PS I know you didn&#39;t ask, but from what I&#39;ve read, moclo can make you manic. builds up tolerance, etc, so I decided to mention those two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it increases the amount of dopamine and noradrenaline released in response to stimulation. </p>

<p>So instead of releasing dopamine like amphetamines, PPAP only releases more dopamine once dopamine is already being naturally released.</p>
