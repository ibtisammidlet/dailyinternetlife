        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is all my pet experience it’s not advice, I’m not claiming anything with scientific certainty, and it’s all personal opinion.
And in my opinion I’m glad I gave it a shot.</p>

<p>I’m situationally very depressed in a apathetic not sad way and have some anchedonia that I believe is related to it On it’s own it was okay I noticed slight improvement in my mental health. But one night I got myself to go hang out at the bar with my best friend. It was a good night I had fun I got pretty drunk but the next morning even though I had a hangover and wanted to lay around all day but I was actually happy not just not depressed. I was chatting my mouth off all day I was laughing out loud at party down and bought a ticket to skrillex at red rocks something I’d normally talk to myself about worries about not having fun or various other anxieties and other similar neurotic thinking about why I shouldn’t or couldn’t do it.
The effect faded and it still it takes a bit of self motivation to do things like go out to dinner and stuff but when I do it removes the anhedonic response and amplifies the gratitude for  those simple things. 
My musical perception is heightened and appreciation.
I don’t believe it’s or even mainly a bdnf driven necessarily a bdnf driven effect. It seems like it’s involvement with the 5ht1ar has a lot to do with it there’s a change in thinking and slight reduction in inhibitions to do things I don’t want to that feels serotergic without the sort ofblah feelings of a ssri. There’s some rational to support a dopamine dishibition theory via 5ht1ar agonism. Flibanserin (a drug I really would like to try. Even though it has some 5ht2 and subtype antagonism may work similarly. I will also note it’s not like mirtazapine which is effective but lacks the sort of sense of well-being that j147 can have.</p>

<p>It takes work and possibly stacking with phenibut bromantane and other nootropics. But it’s reminded me life can get better.
Ithere are not a whole lot of discussion or experience reports and it’s been around for quite a bit and I think it may be under appreciated.
Also I’m going to busy through the weekend so I may not reply to all questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve also had great experiences with J147. </p>

<p>For me it really seemed to quiet down the noises in my head and let me focus. </p>

<p>Used it during a very depressive time and felt it helped me get back on track. Only reason I stopped was because I felt it was impacting my sleep but I plan to go back and run it solo to see if that is the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I totally understand that for me it really quiets down the thinking of something is too hard or things like “I don’t need to do that now I’ll do it later” i still don’t really feel like running errands but I just say okay I’ll do it.</p>

<p>And to get the more profound effects like I had socially the alcohol was a key factor, or phenibut and other things that help me deal with social situations. Also bromantane helps too to magnify the enjoyment, and generally ads a little complimentary boost.</p>

<p>What was your dosage? I range from 35 mg to 100 mg in two doses daily but I found 35 and 10-15 to be about right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dosage on J-147 would range from 30-45mg just once in the morning. </p>

<p>I’ve tried Bromantane and I just can’t sleep no matter what dosage I try. However, that was also mixed with caffeine, now that I’ve basically given up caffeine I may try some lower doses of Bro to see if I still have the sleep problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently took a break from j147 and like I’m the beginning it’s sedating literally but only for a nap 
But I don’t the combo pretty good </p>

<p>I’ve been on 100 mg a day of each bro and j but at… im up to twenty five j an bro im finding a sweet spot but having to taper up in conjunction. I could take more bro but don’t feel like it rn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I did, it’s something that unless stacked is really mild actually made me need a nap at first so think if it has been tried it’s been dismissed.so to get the bang for your buck id stack it with something maybe proglutamatergic or otherwise mentally stimulating I actually don’t notice many pro cognitive effects as far as focus etc and try it before like going to a movie or something it may enhance the experience.
On top of that it just is plain healthy for your brain lol</p>
