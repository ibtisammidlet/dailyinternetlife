Has anyone tried it? Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

<p>However a trk a agonist as functional as 7,8 dhf or atleast not sub perceptible, would be something I’d like to try.
However there’s a big question mark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get that stricter regulations have made life difficult for companies like ND. However, they&#39;ve clearly made a business decision to shift nearly their entire lab/R&amp;D budget over to marketing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I tend to mostly see when I pay attention. I get it, I just don&#39;t like it, and it makes me view all of their new launches with suspicion.</p>

<p>From what you&#39;ve described of Tiger&#39;s milk it actually does sound interesting. May have to actually look into this one. Sorry about the OT post...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but it’s a business decision that contaminated the old sup to the point that everything is a nootropic.
I have up when people were discussing cyanobalmin seriously. In all honesty stack advice has better and more informed discussion than

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, the point of any company in the end is to grow and reach and help as many people as possible. Marketing is a large portion of any company&#39;s budget. Usually 20-35%. That goes up to even 60% for new/startup companies, because the more product they can sell, the more money they have for r&amp;d. Companies like PGL Chem that are able to aquire/develop variations of research compounds requires a substantial amount of money. In which you see in their pricing. ND is attempting to keep prices as low as possible while doing this all.</p>

<p>Having said that, I haven&#39;t purchased from them in a couple years because I&#39;m no longer looking for standard supplements. And unfortunately having a supplement that is 10% more potent doesn&#39;t matter to most of your general public as they see it just as easy to take 10% more of a less costly product. Marketing plays into product labeling unfortunately too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll admit I’m being a hater and I still appreciate the expertise them bringing more novel variants of natural substances out my argument is that they’re not really nootropics or very concenquential ones at least.
For instance the marketing of cognance made some pretty suggestive claims alluding to psychedelic microdosing. The science that backed up the 5ht2ar pam claim was pretty thin itself along with any other research on specifically eblin lactone’s neurological effects. Or implied hyperbole So it’s disappointing the very mainstream direction it’s gone in that respect I understand the going mainstream part  but I rarely shopped there anymore when they still had racetams etc. Im just grumpy and old now lol.</p>

<p>Tldr mysad is a king nootropics depot isn’t relevant to me anymore though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying that’s impossible but first off with the exception of 9mebc mao a inhibitors like harmala are the only ones that I’d personally find strong enough. And I’m constantly paranoid that I’ll get serotonin syndrome. Would I probably not but regardless I don’t like it. 
I do think it’d be possible to have a similar experience w/o the maoi at that dose.</p>

<p>And in the end and really the point of my argument is that you could buy real mushrooms or lsd and really trip or start a real microdose regimen. If the suggested dose was a whole worth I’d not take issue with the marketing if you didn’t have to take up to more than a whole bottle to have a profound effect. 
It would be interesting to try with like 30-100 mg dxm though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NGF isn&#39;t even good, let alone a &quot;mimetic&quot; whatever that means. You want BDNF, ideally with CNTF and other factors, so Cerebrolysin or Cortexin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t express that it isn&#39;t good, and then go on to say you don&#39;t understand what a mimetic is. Mimetics are fairly standard terms in pharmacology. Baclofen being a gaba mimetic for example.</p>

<p>NGF is very important as an adult, especially for sensory neurons, the immune system, the CREB cycle, and suppression of c-Jun (to JNK) which is one of the main processes responsible for apoptosis. Homeostatic response is generally mediated by NGF and is congruent through the entire body.  </p>

<p>Moreso, you&#39;re over simplification of what growth factors are important together could be taken wrong and misconstrued. </p>

<p>BDNF in certain brain regions is shown to cause depression. Specifically the regions where CNTF actively work for dopamine repair (mainly regions of the basal ganglia), BDNF is shown to cause depressive symptomology. TrkB agonists that illicit BDNF also reduce dopamine in the midbrain. Correlation would infer that this reduction of Dopamine is part of what creates depressive symptomology.</p>

<p>As a whole, sure BDNF is good if you&#39;re in need, but can reduce motivation and mood in others. We can&#39;t blanket what we know as helpful and conjugate it with everyone when we don&#39;t know their needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it theoretically should be equally consequential as ngf at the trk a receptor that is if it really is equipotent in its agonism of it. The trk a receptor really in this case is the real point of interest.
I don’t think it’s really fair to say that any neutrophic factor, neurotransmitter, kinase, etc is superior to another. It’s all really dependent on the person and their neurobiology. People respond differently to different things. Bdnf can have negative or unwanted effects in certain people under certain cases. But I digress…</p>

<p>Really I think it’s pretty interesting. Up until now I don’t recall hearing of any exogenous trk a agonists. Regardless of ranked neutrophins. This is novel and a new area to look into in my opinion. If they were to isolate the specific component of these mushrooms, it could lead to a pretty interesting substance to experiment with. Just like 7,8 dhf which in my opinion is honestly is still a pretty og noot in my book.</p>
