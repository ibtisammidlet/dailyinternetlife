    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the best sources! At the forefront of research on the best product, the best solvent. Created by an enthusiast, wanting to share his expertise with the world. I highly recommend it.
Especially since this subreddit, founded by the founder of Everychem, is a mine of precious information, fed by multiple knowledgeable people!</p>

<p>However, I recommend doing as much research as possible on this product, bromantane. Here&#39;s my experience where I made a mistake:</p>

<p>I ordered from Everychem, from France. Super fast delivery (one week, not even). I started using it on my lab rats (since it&#39;s an experimental product, wink). And I made a little mistake: administrating it too often.</p>

<p>Yes beware, its half-life is, depending on the studies, 12 to 24 hours !! So... accumulation can easily occur!
I quickly had saturation symptoms, which were manifested by gas and persistent diarrhea. Because I was administrating it 3 to 4 times a day...</p>

<p>Fortunately, maybe, I was doing it wrong with the nasal administration method. And it was by learning that I was administrating too much and especially too often, that I also learned that one of the best techniques was to aim deep in the nose, and to keep the head upside down for a little while (lying on the edge of a bed for example)</p>

<p>Thus, with a single correct dose administrated in the morning, my saturation symptoms disappeared, and I experienced more consistent effects of motivation, mental alertness and anxiety reduction.
What fascinates me is that administrating it more often hardly added anything extra in terms of effects, in hindsight.
It was purely psychological, I thought it worked like coffee, that you had to take it regularly to boost yourself, 2 to 3 times a day...
And my little mistake of naivety at the beginning, shows that the product is very safe, because I think that with the accumulation over several days of multiple doses, I was in a way excessive dose, but in the end I &quot;only&quot; had big gastrointestinal discomfort, which stopped as soon as I stopped administrating it multiple times per day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They seem reputable and the Selank/Bromantane I&#39;e tried has been legit.  What I don&#39;t get is how they&#39;re selling peptide dropper - which according to PubMed only have a bioavailability of 1-2%.  Maybe they&#39;re doing something unique that makes the solutions effective?  They don&#39;t have absorbents in them so...I&#39;m confused</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say yes, but I take so many things... It seems I can take hot weather a bit better and have more energy, and it seems pretty steady day to day. If it were an emergency I suppose I could go for days on enough bromantane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bromantane is pristine.  So is the selank. I ordered the ipamorelin dropper because it looked like a reconstituted ipam that I would use traditionally but it turned out to be a dropper (not sure why the pic looks different).  I&#39;ve read that nasal spray of ipam has only 20 percent bioavailability (PubMed) and that droppers have a max of 2 percent bioavailability (PubMed) but that there are absorbent enhancers out there.  It doesn&#39;t seem to be mixed with an enhancer - just preservatives.  So now I&#39;m completely confused about that particular purchase.  They also don&#39;t answer certain product questions and won&#39;t tell you that they don&#39;t answer those questions - so I don&#39;t know.  Reputable?  Selank and bromantane for sure.  I&#39;m confused beyond that but maybe they&#39;ve figured something out that hasn&#39;t been published yet</p>
