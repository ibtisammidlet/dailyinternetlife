        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2023-04-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../../user/hi_imandrew.html">hi_imandrew</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As those of you experimenting with <em>Cyclazodone</em> have come to realize, <em>NewMind</em> no longer stocks it.</p>

<p>I thought it would be both interesting and important to have some kind of understanding as to why <em>NewMind</em> has decided to go in this direction and have emailed them asking for clarification.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems the <em>FDA</em> is to blame.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr</em></p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><em>FDA</em></strong> <strong>has pressured</strong> <strong><em>NewMind</em></strong> <strong>into removing</strong> <strong><em>Cyclazodone</em></strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>NMC</em></strong><strong>. There is no legal requirement preventing</strong> <strong><em>NewMind</em></strong> <strong>from stocking them and it does not appear to be a sourcing issue.</strong></p>

<p>Below, are some excerpts from my email correspondence with <em>NewMind</em> asking why <em>Cyclazodone</em> was removed and if it would be available in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>NewMind</em></strong> replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Cyclazodone</em> and <em>NMC</em>, unfortunately the removal from our catalog of these materials is permanent.  </p>

<p>While we believe it may be possible to offer these materials in the future, that will depend on <strong>formal legal guidance and regulatory compliance</strong> changes as stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked <em>NewMind</em> which changes and asked for confirmation that the removal ofÂ <em>Cyclazodone</em> and <em>NMC</em> was due to regulatory changes.</p>

<p><strong><em>NewMind</em></strong> replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We are imposing our own risk management system, based on</em> <strong><em>regulatory pressure from the FDA</em></strong> <em>on imported lots of raw material</em>, and sudden closures of many of our competitors.  </p>

<p>We are also going through <strong>GMP Certification</strong> - these are the changes and our <strong>catalog may be reshaped by emerging new policies</strong>, raw material/restock and ordering prioritizations, <strong>as well as any potential risk of legal recourse or regulatory pressure.</strong>  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to sound maybe cryptic, but there&#39;s really no better way to explain it.  </p>

<p>Our new risk management system considers potential hazmat concerns for handling certain potentially bio-hazardous materials, as well as the <strong>potential for customers to misuse or consume them</strong> - is another risk factor, for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it. Despite <em>Cyclazodone</em> not being regulated, the <em>FDA</em> has decided to single it out and managed to pressure (bully) <em>NewMind</em> into removing it nonetheless.</p>

<p>I wish <em>NewMind</em> would have been more upfront and transparent about the matter, but at least they were professional enough to email me back and provide some information.</p>
