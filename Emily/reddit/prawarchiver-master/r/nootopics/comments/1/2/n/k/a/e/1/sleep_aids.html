    <div class="md"><p>Did you actually try CA + melatonin? My experience with either in isolation has been inconsistent, but combined I get knocked out pretty quick.</p>

<p>Keep in mind for melatonin to work it has to be dosed low, like 300mcg or 1mg slow release.</p>

<p>And grams of CA is obviously way too much and not advisable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you already have good sleep hygiene down (e.g. no blue light 2 hours before bed, blackout curtains, cool bedroom, reading/yoga/Breathwork before bed in place of stimulating activities, or f.lux installed on a laptop to watch a documentary/lighthearted show etc.) then I’d say give 3g of Glycine a whirl.</p>

<p>Basically everyone is deficient as it is, and it’s the primary signaler for the NMDA system, especially in the SCN which controls proper circadian rhythms. It’s cheap, sweet, cools off the body to initiate the sleep cascade, and alongside a cortisol slapper (like phosphatidylserine) was the only thing that fixed a lifelong problem with insomnia for me.</p>

<p>Recently also added some Apigenin with the Glycine out of interest for its anti-aging, NAD+, and GABA/endorphin benefits and I couldn’t even tell you how or when I fell asleep this last week because apparently I just fall into a coma lmao.</p>

<p>But hey, I feel fantastic in the morning and as an adult I don’t think any of us would complain about that childlike slobber-stupor kind of sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glycine definitely helps my sleep quality according to my sleep tracker, but unfortunately does not improve sleep onset or continuity. I do my best to follow Huberman&#39;s advice in relation to light control. I&#39;ve tried pretty much every supplement and grey market compound I can find. I also exercise quite a bit and eat healthy. I don&#39;t drink caffeine 12 hours before bedtime. I&#39;ve had insomnia since I was a kid and the only things that seem to actually work always have tremendous downsides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes the lovely insomnia merry-go-round from some place in between purgatory and a flaming dumpster in hell— which i empathize with fully since sleep onset was the primary issue for me too.</p>

<p>Any chance you’ve done a 23andMe or the like? MethylB12/enough choline for methyl groups play an annoyingly large part in regulating the SCN,  melatonin secretion, and sleep architecture. One of the first things that got me to start yawning (which was so exciting I almost couldn’t sleep anyways lmao) was casually adding some TMG to my NMN/Apigenin stack. After enough experimenting I realized I just need extra B12, P5P (especially heavy hitter for me), and choline/ b2 from eggs— and everything onset related has since been working as it should have always been.</p>

<p>Last quick maybe would be trying Epitalon, which on top of telomere benefits also restores normal melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms</p>

<p>Beyond that I couldn’t say, but I hope you find the answer and can hibernate in recovery as needed my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lemon balm may help to some extent. Glycine and/or GABA may also be of some aid; I take both nightly, along with melatonin and theanine. Fwiw, I use ND&#39;s 300mcg melatonin, which you may want to check out, as it may cause less next-day grogginess.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also recommend a magnesium supplement. Magnesium glycinate is the most common form I see recommended, but personally I take magnesium L-threonate (Magtein). Either are good options.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to tell you that melatonin does not improve sleep more than it gives you the ability to modify your sleep schedule. If you take melatonin at a certain time, it will set your circadian rythm so that it thinks you went to sleep at that time before you actually did. This will result in less sleep if you take it more than half an hour before becoming unconscious. You can use this to wake up earlier and set your schedule back, giving yourself more time to sleep the next night but it&#39;s important that you go to sleep as soon as you start to feel drowsy and don&#39;t drink coffee 6 hours before when you took melatonin last night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orexin antagonist were pretty meh and super expensive. At least Belsomra was. Have you ever tried mirtazapine? I have suffered from insomnia all my life and it is a wonder drug for me in that sense. It’s an atypical tetracyclic. 5-HT2a antagonist along with being an a2 antagonist. It’s not a problem mixing with other serotonergics, I took it with the MAOI Parnate no problem. In fact it is seen as a possible antidote medication in the event of serotonin syndrome. I take it sublingually. I figured if I had to take a pharmaceutical that it is better than a gaba-ergic or worse, something like quetiapine. Only side effect I’ve had is some strong hunger after you take it. Mirtazapine’s twin Trazodone is also a good choice and much more well known.</p>

<p>L-THP - dysphoric and generally only gives me 5-6 hours of sleep </p>

<p>Melatonin - doesn&#39;t work and gives next day grog</p>

<p>Doxylamine succinate - works but gives hangover/grog</p>

<p>High dose taurine - worked somewhat for a short period, now does nothing</p>

<p>Zma - not strong enough but is a good support supplement </p>

<p>Weed - just quit cause it makes me too lethargic and negatively impacts cognition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Right now this is my only &quot;go-to&quot;&quot; sleep aid that works. There&#39;s some downsides tho. It&#39;s essentially an antipsychotic and is dysphoric. And with consistent use my mood tanks from lack of dopamine.  It also never gets me more than 5-6 hours of sleep and it&#39;s not the best sleep. According to my sleep tracker I get mostly &quot;light sleep&quot; with reductions in rem and deep sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, Belsomra was interesting. (at first I tried Quviviq, did not work.) then I tried belsomra, and it worked initially for a week or two, and then it felt like it stopped working completely. If I would rotate between these two, then they would help slightly more, but if I took half of each, then it seems to help a lot more. Unfortunately, getting a prescription for both is highly unlikely. I should also say that Belsomra combined with trazodone also works quite well when the belsomra stops working on its own.</p>

<p>For me, mirtazapine did not help much, and on certain days when it slightly did, it was not worth the residual fatigue the next day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found B is much better for sleep than GABA-A. GABA-B actually improves sleep architecture while e.g. benzodiazepines disrupt it, even though they might knock one out.
Acute or sporadic is the keyword here though and if one has addictive tendencies stay away. Don&#39;t take it and stay awake, it&#39;s better to take it right before bed so you wake up and don&#39;t even remember feeling any effects except a good night&#39;s rest.
I definitely don&#39;t recommend this route, but just putting this info out there.</p>
