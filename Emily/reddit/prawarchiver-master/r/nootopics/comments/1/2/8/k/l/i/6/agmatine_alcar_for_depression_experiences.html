<p>She’s been on SSRI’s (Zoloft) for depression in the past and does not wish to return.</p>

<p>Her being new to nootropics I’ve persuaded her to use ALCAR in tandem with Agmatine as an alternative to target the systems above.</p>

<p>Anyone here had a similar experience and success with this combination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agmatine and ALCAR are great supplements, but I don’t think they’re potent enough to lift someone out of that deep of a depression.</p>

<p>They’re inexpensive and safe though, so worth a try.</p>

<p>I actually went through that exact type of depression before.  It only finally went away when I made drastic and difficult changes to my life.  (And I tried tons of noots.) Building for the future makes it difficult to obsess with the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building for the future makes it difficult to obsess with the past. Fantastic way to look at life.</p>

<p>I do think activity, goal setting etc is the most potent cure though for me agmatine eliminated my excessive rumination causing anxiety - likely due to its ability to clamp down on Glutamate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s awesome the Agmatine helped you.  It does seem promising.</p>

<p>I had even tried NAC, but it couldn’t stop my obsessive rumination about the past.  But by that point I was numbing myself out with excessive Kratom, so that’s probably why other supplements didn’t help.  </p>

<p>Sometimes though we’re just in a situation where at the moment there’s no way out though.  When I finally got sober from booze, my life was an unbearable disaster.  I had to spend years cleaning up the mess I made in the past, before I could move on to the future .  </p>

<p>But my gosh when I finally got to a point where I could build for the future again, my whole spirit came back to life.  My testosterone even shot way up, my skin is glowing, eyes are more blue now ( they were grey when I was depressed.). The difference is crazy.</p>

<p>life’s still difficult though, but at least I’m dealing with present problems, not things from the past.  Hope you’re able to push through everything man.  And Whatever supplements you find help get you going, I say use them (if they’re safe lol)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting you say that. </p>

<p>It seems that one of the biggest challenges for alcoholics or ex-drinkers is overcoming the regret, feelings of shame, guilt and rumination over the past. I say this as have numerous friends and relatives who have suffered from alcoholism.</p>

<p>At some point people just have to accept the past, forgive themselves and work towards a better future. </p>

<p>I’m pretty good myself and though I have abused substances in the past, not necessarily alcoholic, and struggled with depression, I rarely chase drug induced euphoria these days. For me, personal forgiveness, goal setting, physical training and growing closer to my loved ones were the most powerful recovery agents.</p>

<p>I only got into nootropics and supplementation after the foundations were in place, they can be tremendously helpful but not always without risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it’s so hard to accept all the embarrassing, immoral, destructive, disgusting things alcohol can push you to do.  Thank God I was never violent though, and didn’t destroy anyone else’s life in my fury.  But I def verbally lashed out a lot, particularly at my own loved ones and parents, who were desperately trying to help.</p>

<p>Then I was trapped for over three years with all kinds of legal issues, and other problems, before I could move on.  That’s when major depression sank in.  (I was actually drinking for anxiety, I wasn’t depressed at that time)</p>

<p>Those are awesome things you’re doing for yourself.  Too many guys are caught up in video games and porn nowadays (video games are fine in moderation I suppose), but I do sympathize with some of them to an extent, as many were dealt an awful hand.  But it’s good to hear you’re focused on goals and your future.  You’re ahead of so many just with that.</p>

<p>Nootropics are really interesting for sure.  I like to think they help a lot.  Some of the help I think is down the road though….for example they may be preventing Alzheimer’s in you, but you don’t even realize it now.  </p>

<p>And be sure to ask your doctor to test your testosterone, and research various supplements if it’s low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long was she on Zoloft and how long has she been off?<br/>
Never tried agmatine. But have used ALCAR many times at different doses for long periods of time and never noticed anything positive or negative as far as mood.<br/>
I had some success with a combination of 1500mg l- tyrosine plus 100mg 5-htp 3 times a day.  And if she is in a northern area without much sunshine in the winter a SAD light can help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed we’re in the UK and SAD is big here, I’m trying to get her to join the country club and get out more!</p>

<p>ALCAR was really noticeable for me when I wasn’t eating much red meat, big boost in cognition, motivation etc which translated to mood.</p>

<p>Also she was on for about 3 years, off for 8 months or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A relative of mine is suffering terribly from rumination, lack of motivation, low mood and letting go of past experiences.&quot;  Are you my relative? :)</p>

<p>I was not eating virtually any red meat for a couple years (maybe a burger once in a blue moon), and was drinking moderately-heavy to combat stress and fell into a moderate-depression.  The first time I took 500mg of Alcar it was like the light turned on and I had tried other supplements/noots prior (not a lot). I felt energetic and an uplifted mood but not like I drank a double espresso. It was smoother.  I decided to try to cut down on alcohol, increase regular exercise and go for a Flexitarian diet (basically a pseudo-vegitarian that eats only lean animal protein infrequently - you get fats from olive oil, avocados, etc.)  It helped but I&#39;m prone to anxiety/stress and found I&#39;m back into a moderate anxiety/depression state and I emphasis the word moderate (not to the point I feel I need to see a Psychiatrist and ask for a prescription.)</p>

<p>I love to exercise and easily get out of bed but I&#39;m struggling with getting work done and staying on task and easily run out of steam in the afternoon. Caffeing is NOT the answer due to the tolerance build up and effect on blood pressure. So I just started taking Alcar 500mg a day again.  Not noticing as pronounced of an effect as before but it&#39;s definitely not hurting and it&#39;s a pretty safe supp. Since I rarely eat beef and little other animal protein the whole gut TMAO scare really doesn&#39;t apply to me either (google TMAO and Acetyl-L-Carnitine if you haven&#39;t heard about this.)</p>

<p>After much research I also decided to try Agmatine.  One dose a day. Today was my 7th day.  Started at 300mg, then 500mg, and now I&#39;m at 700mg. This one is very subtle so you&#39;ll find a lot of people saying &quot;it does nothing for me&quot; or taking very high doses like 2g+ a day to try to &quot;feel an effect.&quot;  For some they do feel it for others it&#39;s so subtle it barely noticeable if noticeable at all.  For me, it&#39;s extremely subtle at 500-700mg to the point of it could be placebo effect.  I will definitely experiment with a 1-1.5g dose but I don&#39;t feel this is an effective drug for mood if I have to go more than 1g a day. Just my gut feel.  And I would definitely cycle it off for at least a couple days every week or take a week off every month if possible.  There&#39;s no such thing as a Free Lunch in my opinion with these substances.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m basically still at the beginning of trying to find the right simple stack to augment diet and exercise to get back in balance with my mood.  ALCAR and Agmatine relative to everything else I&#39;ve studied are on the safer/milder end of the spectrum in my opinion but they aren&#39;t probably going to be a silver bullet for most people in most cases especially if they have fairly severe depression/anxiety.</p>

<p>Dosage is also a big differentiator as far as effects (potentially). Many people experience significant antidepressant effects evidently, so definitely should be considered.</p>
