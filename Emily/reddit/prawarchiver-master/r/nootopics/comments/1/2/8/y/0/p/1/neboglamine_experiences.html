    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say anything definitive, but since starting Neboglamine here&#39;s some things I&#39;ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything feeling more vivid: First time I took it, I went on a walk an hour after and kept thinking to myself, &quot;Was there always this much going on around me?&quot; I noticed more sounds and sights. Just felt like there was a lot more going on. Also seemed to be a bit more present.</li>
<li>Unblocking of thought patterns: Since starting, it&#39;s felt like there&#39;s been a lot more options opened up to me...idk how to explain it. Like when I think of the future, I can imagine a lot more possibilities. I&#39;ve been finding more ways to fill my time, novel ways of doing things. It&#39;s subtle, but it&#39;s nice. A feeling of being unrestricted in what&#39;s possible, I suppose.</li>
<li>Some mood boost: More cheery, maybe? More optimistic? The world feels a bit brighter, fuller, and it feels like there&#39;s a bit more to look forward to.</li>
</ul>

<p>These results are confounded by some recent changes in my life, so who knows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d generally concur with this experience. I too went on a walk the first time I tried it and was much more aware of everything.</p>

<p>I literally noticed what I think was a gopher pop its head out of a hole and start looking around, almost right at me. I stopped and just stared in awe. Would&#39;ve taken a pic, but I had gloves on.</p>

<p>Nebo also seems to greatly improve my ADHD. I can get a decent amount done, and what I spend my time on more often than not seems to be productive.</p>

It improves mood and has a noticeable effect for me on reward circuits, meaning I’m less attracted by compulsive or addictive patterns. It works really well in tandem with Tak, Bromantane and tropisetron as well. It’s a bit expensive but I think he’s trying to figure out a nasal spray which may or may not be possible but would reduce the price significantly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reward circuitry damaged? If your issue is anhedonia--the inability or reduced ability to derive pleasure from things--then NSI-189 may help with that more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I used to deal with anhedonia and I think it was due to developmental trauma and the resulting hypervigilance, followed by numbness (but likely still an overactive threat detector/chronic stress running in the background). Things are better these days and I&#39;ve done a lot of work. Now, I&#39;ve found that I just need to re-train myself to get pleasure from effort (e.g. running, weight lifting, making art, etc.). It&#39;s easy in today&#39;s world to just get quick and easy dopamine hits and when your reward circuitry is in a re-building phase (in my experience), you become extra sensitive to these and it requires hard work and consistency to re-train yourself to get reward through effort and get everything functioning well again. I think I likely need to work on training my nervous system to feel safe as well.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried NSI 189 in the past, but can try again maybe. I&#39;m not sure if the results I got back then were more about circumstances and behavior modification or the NSI- or if one enhanced the other..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading some of your replies, I share many of the same issues. If I&#39;m going to do activities, I only really do them if I&#39;m excited about doing it. I thrive with structure, but I also get bored of it after some time. I cycle through patterns of exciting activities, and eventually come back around to the same things when they feel thrilling again (gym, rock climbing, art, coding, etc). I&#39;m constantly trying to keep that atmosphere of intense eagerness when I go about my days. It&#39;s pushed me to seek out things like nootropics that can make me feel &#39;alive&#39;, and overall nothing really gets me there. It&#39;s not necessarily bad or sad, just profoundly boring. NSI-189 didn&#39;t help much, not even after the 3rd round, not consciously anyway. Bromantane has been almost there, but it&#39;s hit or miss. In my early 20&#39;s I had landmark mental changes I went through, and those feelings of expanding awareness and being-ness came to a peak. After living within that framework for so long, I don&#39;t always feel that excited to do things the same way. It has it&#39;s ups and downs and I&#39;m continually learning more about myself. It&#39;s like you said though, you can retrain yourself back into that mindset. I bring this all up because if I&#39;m reading into your experience right, I think a new way to look at life and yourself might be more powerful than any substance. There are books written by Jane Roberts that are quite amazing. Take a look at The Nature of Personal Reality or Seth Speaks. If you do, I hope those help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is only the second day I&#39;ve tried it, but it seems to enhance mood and produces significant calming / anxiolytic effects. These effects are not sedating and I actually feel like I make better use of time. My time anxiety disappears completely.</p>

<p>I suspect this is due at least in some respect to improved executive functioning. Eliminates a lot of the irrational, insecure feelings I have. </p>

<p>Pretty amazing stuff IMO, will be interesting to see what other potential benefits occur with sustained use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried both 40mg oral as well as 20mg IN.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t done IN for a few days, just because it&#39;s more intense, doesn&#39;t last as long, and produces more of an anxious feeling for me. That said, I think set and setting are likely contributing factors.</p>

<p>Been using 40mg oral for the past several days. I think I prefer the effects of this ROA, which tend to be either slightly sedating or anxiolytic for me. IN is conversely far more wakefulness promoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not long enough and not in the right context or conditions. I was trying to combine it with tropisetron at the time without having taken them in isolation. I was also abusing caffeine and was taking bromantane and Sabroxy. I was mainly looking to improve my depression and whatnot well also giving myself a kick in the ass focus and energy-wise to be able to do my school work. I&#39;ve since developed more healthy habits overall, including quitting caffeine and prioritizing exercise and sleep. Thus, I&#39;m probably in a better position to trial it now if I was to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like you already understand haha but I do think that a solo trial with TAK for at least two weeks for it to build up. Then see if it’s right for you as it’s very beneficial for introspection which can lead to better habits and improvement for depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that would be a good thing. It might, but, I feel like part of my problem is that I exist in my head too much and likely would benefit from getting in touch with my body and emotions more. With that said, I have been meditating more, which is one way to tackle the above issue. With meditation and Tak, I may be able to make something happen.</p>

I&#39;ve had low empathy for quite awhile which was worsened after my stroke and getting the virus twice.</p>

<p>My wife is super empathetic so we don&#39;t see eye to eye very often. I tend to give upo or not even start doing things I once enjoyed, I end up watching YouTube videos about things that I enjoy doing but not actually doing them.</p>

<p>I want to feel alive, present, happy, open to last minute opportunities. I want to go with the flow</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I didn&#39;t really notice much of anything. I thought I did at first, but I had combined it with Sabroxy and caffeine and could have just had a dopamine high lol</p>

<p>I may give it another go now that I&#39;m a bit more balanced overall. Then again, one of these days I&#39;m supposed to start ketamine treatment for treatment resistance depression- if the people in charge of the therapy ever get their shit together to help me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, ok. As a fellow treatment resistant depressive, good luck with the ketamine therapy! I did about 3 intravenous sessions a couple years ago and enjoyed the trips immensely, though I didn’t feel like I was getting any residual benefits, plus the $400 out of pocket per session cost wasn’t easy to do so I stopped. Though, of course, I’ve heard it can take up to 12 sessions to get long lasting benefits. Since then I recently learned about TMS therapy, and I found a clinic that offers it about 15 minutes away from my house, which is very convenient when you have to go 5 days a week for about six weeks. And insurance covered it so I’m just on the hook for a 20 per visit copay. Not sure if any benefits yet, but this clinic also offers the esketamine/nasal ketamine therapy which insurance also covers so I may try this version of ketamine therapy if the TMS doesn’t work. Gotta keep at it. I wish you all the best!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s a pain in the dick to find good treatment at a reasonable cost. I got denied coverage for esketamine myself and now they&#39;re proposing we try the racemic ketamine sublingually. They mentioned that it was cheap, but idk if they mean cheap in terms of treatments, or... y&#39;know, legitimately cheap lol</p>

<p>Honestly at this point I&#39;m thinking I just do racemic ketamine at home. It&#39;s probably more affordable and a nicer environment to do everything in than in the clinic 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>In the meantime, psilocybin microdoses have been helpful.</p>

<p>TMS is good stuff. I&#39;d totally go for that if I had insurance offering to cover it. Good luck!</p>

<p>Lemme know how it goes</p>
