A few of you may know me from the Nootopics Discord. I recently reviewed the literature of different probiotics on athletic performance. For those interested see the list below with citations:<br/>
<strong>Hope everyone is doing good!</strong></p>

<p>Studies suggest that endurance athletes are at higher-than-average risk for atherosclerosis and myocardial damage. The ability of plant-based regimens to reduce risk and affect performance was reviewed. The effect of plant-based diets on cardiovascular risk factors, particularly plasma lipid concentrations, body weight, and blood pressure, and, as part of a healthful lifestyle, reversing existing atherosclerotic lesions, may provide a substantial measure of cardiovascular protection. In addition, plant-based diets may offer performance advantages. They have consistently been shown to reduce body fat, leading to a leaner body composition. Because plants are typically high in carbohydrate, they foster effective glycogen storage. By reducing blood viscosity and improving arterial flexibility and endothelial function, they may be expected to improve vascular flow and tissue oxygenation. Because many vegetables, fruits, and other plant-based foods are rich in antioxidants, they help reduce oxidative stress. Diets emphasizing plant foods have also been shown to reduce indicators of inflammation. These features of plant-based diets may present safety and performance advantages for endurance athletes. The purpose of this review was to explore the role of nutrition in providing cardioprotection, with a focus on plant-based diets previously shown to provide cardiac benefits.</p>

<p>Results showed that 4 weeks of SA-03 supplementation significantly improved muscle strength and endurance performance, increased hepatic and muscular glycogen storage, and decreased lactate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ammonia, and creatine kinase (CK) levels after exercise. These observations suggest that SA-03 could be used as a nutritional supplement to enhance exercise performance and reduce. Lactobacillus salivarius</p>

<p>The results showed that 4 weeks of PL-02 supplementation could significantly increase muscle mass, improve muscle strength and endurance performance, and increase hepatic and muscular glycogen storage. Furthermore, PL-02 could significantly decrease fatigue biochemical parameters, such as lactate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ammonia, and creatine kinase (CK) levels, after exercise. We believe that PL-02 can be used as a supplement to improve exercise performance and for its anti-fatigue effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were able to show that the <strong>TWK10</strong> group had significantly higher endurance performance and glucose content in a maximal treadmill running test compared to the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that TWK10 supplementation may be beneficial to energy harvest. Taken together, our results suggest that TWK10 has the potential to be an aerobic exercise supplement for physiological adaptation or an ergogenic supplement with health benefits for amateur runners.</p>

<p>Especially in the HK-PS23 supplemented group, there was a better trend. In conclusion, we found that L-PS23 or HK-PS23 supplementation for six weeks prevented strength loss after muscle damage and improved blood muscle damage and inflammatory markers, with protective, accelerated recovery and anti-fatigue benefits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results indicated that α-cyclodextrin supplementation improved human endurance exercise performance. Moreover, B. uniformis administration in mice increased swimming time to exhaustion, cecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations, and the gene expression of enzymes associated with gluconeogenesis in the liver while decreasing hepatic glycogen content. These findings indicate that B. uniformis enhances endurance exercise performance, which may be mediated by facilitating hepatic endogenous glucose production.</p>

<p>LG2809 ingestion was effective in preventing reduced natural killer cell activity due to strenuous exercise and elevating mood from a depressed state. In addition, LG2809 + αLA was found to alleviate minor resting fatigue, which was supported objectively by the significant reduction in the serum reactive oxygen metabolites and transforming growth factor β1 levels. These effects could be helpful for athletes to maintain mental and physical condition.</p>

<p>Probiotic therapy had a positive effect on selected parameters of body composition and cardiorespiratory fitness of study participants and showed a tendency to reduce inflammation. In the group of men using the probiotic, an increase in lean body mass (p = 0.019) and skeletal muscle mass (p = 0.022) was demonstrated, while in the group of women taking the probiotic, a decrease in the content of total body fat (p = 0.600) and visceral fat (p = 0.247) was observed. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) increased in women (p = 0.140) and men (p = 0.017) using the probiotic. Concentration of tumour necrosis factor-alpha decreased in women (p = 0.003) and men (p = 0.001) using the probiotic and in women (p = 0.074) and men (p = 0.016) using the placebo.</p>

<p>Similarly, it had no impact on plasma or urine malondialdehyde levels; however, it increased the abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum and decreased the presence of health-related taxa including Roseburia, Blautia, and Bifidobacterium longum. Thus, long-term protein supplementation may have a negative impact on gut microbiota.</p>

<p>No results posted after 2 years which seems suspect. If there was a clear outcome they&#39;d be all over the reporting of it. </p>

<p>Shame as I had high hopes for it.</p>
