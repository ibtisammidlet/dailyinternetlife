        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Any reason why stacking these two together would cause any negative interactions? </p>

<p>I know everychem stocks Tabernanthalog which is a very interesting compound but the price isn’t sustainable for me personally. As 135 plus shipping just is too heavy of a price for me. Though I am a big proponent of microdosing as I ran a few cycles of it and it had tremendous benefits to ASPD and ADHD as well as incredible benefits to lateral thinking. It’s just the other side affects and legality keep me from pursuing it for more long term use. </p>

<p>While the next best thing currently available would then be cognance which interacts and also acts on 5-HT2A receptors and M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. So it seems very promising and anecdotes are rather positive. I just don’t know enough about TAK if any interactions would occur with the two or perhaps synergizes well if anyone knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny I was about to post and ask the exact.
Thank you all in advance for posting your experiences. It’s helping and I can totally relate. </p>

<p>I have both. On my 3rd day of TAK, very interesting. 
I take cognance at night, and my dreams have been WILD. Last night, I was extremely tired from the last two days. And I had spilt my Tak dose in tk two, trying to find my sweet spot.
And last nights dreams took the cake. I haven’t felt astral travel style dreams like this since an astral travel experience.   </p>

<p>Today I had Tak in morning, with 2 Shots of Bromantane. And Semax. 
Was cruising today as I kind of planned to take it easy after the rush of work. But something switched, took my dose. Once in motion, phone away and in rhythm in my work. 
Serious details I never noticed before and emphasized as I was repairing and restoring guitars / winding pickups for my company. Some intricate details. I almost have a newfound passion I attribute to Semax the week before and then the Tak, both have honed in my attention to detail.</p>

<p>When I’m winding down, and about to go to sleep.
I feel like Tak has enhanced these little daydreams
I have before a nap, and or before heading to bed. 
Awesome stuff. Feels like my imagination is running free. Tomorrow I focus on more scientific stuff. Soldering, making custom pickguards for the YouTube channel, coil winding with patterns embedded i learned from special projects working in Silicon Valley. Innovative stuff. I’m pushing boundaries, and Tak I feel is starting to build up.</p>

<p>Will report back tomorrow.</p>

<p>Anyone stacking it with a Bromantane? And or Semax?</p>

<p>My morning this last week has been..
Was 
Semax from Russia (3ml)
With adderall Teva 30. 
That was all day zoom, again stay away from phone.</p>

<p>Then package arrived Saturday from EC. 
Semax new bottle was much more noticeable in that slight zest. 
Took Tak first time 
Enhancement but couldn’t tell. </p>

<p>Added Bromantane yesterday and today.
Wow.
Keeping it minimal. 1-2 sprays. 
The Semax i was taking for a mild concussion I should’ve treated with it. I went to Australia for 6 weeks. And was paranoid of taking anything in, because I heard customs were strict I didn’t even bring certain things to hydrate guitars on tour because of the dogs inquiring.</p>

<p>To be honest. The relaxed environment after my tour and hanging there drop my stress levels drastically. And so, I have heard TAK will amplify emotions.
 I pretty much dropped Phenibut,
And lowered/Near dropped my night time small Valium dose.</p>

<p>Coming back to California. Felt like a new person. 
And not having Bromantane for those 6 weeks was interesting. </p>

<p>I’d say clearing my mind on that business trip relived the stress needed for next step in company. 
Plus Tak was introduced at the right time.
Very excited to see how this builds up.
Ranting now.</p>

<p>Will report back. Thank all of you for sharing your information. This has been insightful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like a fascinating dude. Dreamer, researcher, musician…same vibes here so maybe I’m biased lol. Will have to give the cognance a try some day. Just got the TAK in and looking forward to seeing how it goes. I’d be interested in checking out your work tbh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semax is a good choice for concussion. There&#39;s also Cerebrolysin, which some people take intranasally for cost effectiveness and convenience. TAK-653 was nice. I&#39;ve been meaning to get more but I&#39;m a poor college student lol. As for bromantane, whenever I forget to dose, I just simply get less done that day. It also reliably gives me a minor euphoria that&#39;s very nice.</p>
