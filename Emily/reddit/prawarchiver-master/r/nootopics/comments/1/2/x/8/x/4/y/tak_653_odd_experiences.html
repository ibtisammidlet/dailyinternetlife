<p>I’ve been observing my bodily movements passively since starting TAK. I also have the sensation that I am listening to my thoughts and can respond to them if that makes sense. I’ve now kind of snapped myself out of an hour long discussion within myself debating if free will really exists.

<p>Reading this back makes me sound like a pseudo- intellectual stoner. But my experience on TAK has been quite distracting yet I see and experience the benefits. </p>

<p>Has anyone else had thoughts bias towards contemplating existence on TAK-653? </p>

<p>How did you stop them and use the compound productively?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works like this: cognitive enhancement -&gt; higher self-awareness -&gt; existential contemplation.</p>

<p>AMPA receptor function and cognitive enhancement: Lynch (2004) showed that AMPA receptor PAMs, such as TAK-653, can improve cognitive functions like learning and memory by enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP), a key cellular mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity. </p>

<p>Cognitive enhancement and self-awareness: Grant et al. (2010) found that cognitive enhancement can lead to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences. In their study, individuals who underwent cognitive training exhibited greater self-awareness and understanding of their cognitive processes. </p>

<p>Self-awareness and existential contemplation: Silvia &amp; Philips (2013) discovered that higher self-awareness can lead to existential contemplation. They found that individuals with higher self-awareness were more likely to engage in existential thinking and philosophical inquiry.</p>

<p>TAK-653, as an AMPA receptor PAM, enhances cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, leading to increased self-awareness. This heightened self-awareness, in turn, may promote existential contemplation and introspective experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care much about introspection for nootropics, because if I wanted introspection etc. I&#39;d simply use shrooms or lsd. There is no reason to look for introspection in anything else, really. But let&#39;s check anyway. First, dry research to build our hypotheses on:</p>

<p>Winblad (2005) found that piracetam improved cognitive function in elderly individuals with cognitive impairment, maybe (?) leading to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences.</p>

<p>Aniracetam improved memory and cognition (Nakamura &amp; Kurasawa, 2001; Martin et al., 1993), which may (?) contribute to increased self-awareness and introspective experiences.</p>

<p>Oxiracetam enhanced memory consolidation in rats (Mondadori et al., 1993) and improved cognitive performance in patients with mild to moderate dementia (Passeri et al., 1996), potentially leading to heightened self-awareness and introspective experiences.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look for novel connections between studies:</p>

<p>Emotional processing: Aniracetam has been shown to enhance emotional processing in animal models (Nishizaki et al., 1998). Enhanced emotional processing could lead to a deeper understanding of one&#39;s emotions, further promoting introspection. This is supported by the findings of Silvia &amp; Philips (2013) that higher self-awareness can lead to existential contemplation.</p>

<p>Creativity and problem-solving: Research on AMPA receptor modulation and cognition has found connections to enhanced creativity and problem-solving skills. For example, a study by Canals et al. (2009) showed that aniracetam improved problem-solving performance in rats. Increased creativity and problem-solving abilities could lead to more profound introspective experiences by expanding the scope of one&#39;s cognitive explorations.</p>

<p>Cholinergic transmission: Racetams, such as aniracetam, have been found to modulate cholinergic transmission in the brain (Shimizu et al., 1995). Cholinergic transmission is essential for cognitive function, including attention and memory. By enhancing cholinergic transmission, racetams may indirectly facilitate introspection through improved cognitive abilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank You for the detailed reply.  And yeah I’d agree psychedelics (and weed IME) are much better for introspection.</p>

<p>But considering most people have an utter lack of self awareness, and often no desire to gain it (even if they claim to want it,) would cognitive enhancement really help them?  Or would they just use their enhanced cognition to further support their own delusions?</p>

<p>IQ and Realism can be completely distinct.  Many high IQ people can construct complex ideas of self, and even whole ideologies about society, that appear to make sense, but when checked against reality the whole idea came from a desire to validate an emotion or ego.  Self awareness can be quite painful, and most people prefer to avoid pain and feel good.</p>

<p>Now the type of people who seek nootropics tend to be those  who already have above average intelligence (which is a bit of a paradox because you could argue that they need them less.)  And I would imagine they are also more self aware, although I have no proof of this. </p>

<p>So amongst the types who seek nootropics I would say it would enhance their self awareness.  But if you gave nootropics to someone with either a low IQ and/or low self awareness I personally doubt it would have much impact on them.  At best, an intelligent but emotional person would just use their increased cognition to rationalize their unpleasant emotions into pleasant ones.  However, A low IQ person perhaps would gain some self awareness if they truly desired it (but in general they don’t; low IQ people just prefer entertainment and drama.)</p>

<p>I do like your theory about higher self awareness leading to existential contemplation.  I’ve definitely noticed this with in myself the more self aware I become.  It’s quite painful, so it’s both a blessing and a curse.  It may have played a big role in my prior addictions.  But I wouldn’t have it any other way.  </p>

<p>Anyways, my theories here are far from perfect, so feel free to refute anything you disagree with.  Would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming that it is intelligent people who seek nootropics may be true, but it is actually a dangerous thought at the same time. I would rather avoid this way of thinking, as it could lead to nootropics-interested people to develop elitist culture, or an individual start thinking highly of himself in sort of a mania, and it could end badly, considering it is just so pleasant and it lies in human nature to consider ourselves more intelligent that others for whatever reasons.... it happens even without certain substances, and with accepts to nootropics/ adhd medications, it increases the risk 2x.</p>

<p>If you are interested in existential contemplation, or higher self-awareness, I seriously encourage to simply go for a one-time psychedelic trip, then integrate it, and then come back to the &quot;standard programming&quot;, the usual course of the day with groceries and boring, usual potatoe peeling.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Seriously: one-time 8-hour trip will open more mental doors and show more repressed insights that 10 years of nootropics could ever offer. I have never been more certain of anything: go for a one-time trip <strong>per year</strong> for the purpose of self-reflections according to eg. Terrence Mckeena instructions, then integrate it for 1-2 weeks without taking any nootropics,  and then simply go back to nootropics if you need, but this time, <strong>nothing related to self-rumination</strong>. Simply go for cognition or focus or whatever, but do not seek existential analysis: everything that could help you in that, is already contained in form of shrooms/lsd/maybe thc. That&#39;s it. And never go for self-rumination for longer than a 8-hour trip + a week of integratrion. It&#39;s just no point, and could take you way off the ground.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<p>if interested in self-rumination, looking into your psyche, existential fears, self-care: go for one-time psychedelic trip* works well every time 100%</p>

<p>if interested in focus, cognition, intelligence: go for nootropics, and it will take a while to find something that works, if you will be able to find it at all</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>*warning: it could change your relationship you have with intelligence, and your perception of the concept of intelligence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the suggestion, maybe you could help me here?</p>

<p>I tend to be a low responder to psychedelics, but I’m not sure why.  The products I got were usually great; everyone was tripping out on much lower doses.  I get a nice lift from them, some good visuals, but unfortunately I’ve never had any profound introspection on them.  </p>

<p>I’ve done 5 tabs of acid a few times with only a light trip, and did a 5.5 gram mushroom trip recently (in the dark alone with piano music) and it was nothing at all like the divine ineffable experience most people get.    This has been this way my whole life.</p>

<p>I’d really like to break through or have a profound psychedelic experience.</p>

<p>Now, THC I’m the opposite.  Even just a tiny toke, even of an alt like d8, gets me so deep in my own head.  Unfortunately I can’t do it often as I can’t function on a THC high, and I’m prone to anxiety on it.</p>

<p>I considered mixing THC with LSD, but was afraid it might turn into a hell scape with how THC can effect me sometimes </p>

<p>Anyways how can I get more out of psychedelics if I’m a low responder?  Or will I just not be able to get much more?  I have mild Autism, maybe that’s why but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Thank You for your help</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not recommend anyone psychedelics whom I am not a friend of and I don&#39;t know that person well. Because there are people who should not take it, and I would never know. It is the kind of responsibility and journey that one has to take on their own. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>THC and LSD I would not mix ever, due to how these work together. I can only say I know that if I had a friend who I knew had no psychiatric disorsers of any kind and no history of schizophrenia in the family, I would recommend a 10-minute lasting DMT trip in safe environement. It is the strongest one. But first, the ritual of DMT taking should start at reading at least two any Terrence McKenna&#39;s books, in order to enter a framework of thought that will enable a safe journey. And of course, the substance would need to be tested, diet, sleep, set and setting all set up properly. The alternative could be to up the dose of LSD/shrooms perhaps.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Now that I am thinking of it, if you were interested in retrospection, maybe Terrence Mckenna&#39;s audio videos on youtube would be a good start?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been experimenting with different nootropics since I was in college almost ten years ago. Of the hundreds I&#39;ve tried, aniracetam is the only one I actually stuck with. There&#39;s some subtle things I&#39;ve noticed but the main thing is that it makes me a better speaker. I can articulate my thoughts a lot more clearly when I&#39;m talking. By default my thoughts are extremely fast and I generally talk fast to keep up. I have to actively try to slow down my speaking pace, especially so when I&#39;m nervous. Aniracetam kind of helps slow me down allowing me to have more time to focus on what words to say next, so I end up coming off way more eloquent and calm. There are few other nootropics/racetams that have this effect, but aniracetam uniquely does not disturb my sleep. I&#39;ve also noticed that it sharpens my mind to the point where it&#39;s harder for me to feel drunk when having alcohol. This could be a good or bad thing depending on the situation (in some cases, the goal is precisely to be dumb and bold).</p>

<p>When I took TAK-653 I did notice greater introspection and a deeper penetration of insight into the causation of certain behaviors, emotions, mindsets and other phenomenon pertaining to personality.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I experienced an undeniable increase in existential, metaphysical, or philosophical thinking. But to be honest, those kinds of thoughts are always swirling around in my head anyways. Keep up the contemplating.

    <div class="md"><p>It may be because of the enhanced cognitive function and increased neuronal activity resulting from TAK-653&#39;s action on AMPA receptors.</p>

<p>AMPA receptors are a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor involved in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. By potentiating AMPA receptor function, TAK-653 can increase synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Monyer et al., 1991).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an extremely confusing experience with this compound. When I took it, I was extremely tired throughout the day. However late at night this wore off and I started to do massive self-reflection on the current state of my life. I realized that if I were to die and my life were to flash before my eyes, I would probably be yelling at myself for always being so in my head. I&#39;d be yelling to stop worrying so much about shit that doesn&#39;t matter, and to enjoy the present moments because they will not last forever.  Not sure if this is a coincidence but this happened only after a single usage at 2mg.</p>

<p>thoughts like this can be normal but if you&#39;d characterize them as distracting and something you have to &quot;snap out&quot; of— then it sounds almost manic. </p>

<p>Are your conclusions rational?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being rational is obviously extremely subjective when we’re talking about consciousness, free will, and existence. My exact thoughts were really about if consciousness is an illusion since it really doesn’t make sense to me. It wasn’t too out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>The only out of ordinary thing was the thought depth. I got extremely in depth into this thought like I was conversing with myself. I was sitting on a chair in my room looking out the window in deep thought for about an hour.</p>

<p>Is that mania? I space out all the time but it’s not nearly as stimulating when I’m using TAK.</p>

<p>I use 1 mg or .25 ml EC TAK every other day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So for me, an example of a manic irrational thought that might have followed this subject is: &quot;We don&#39;t have free-will so maybe if I continue thinking on this, I can map out the future up to my death or the end of time (because everything must be on a fixed course)&quot;</p>

<p>That wouldn&#39;t be very productive, but the state you&#39;re describing actually sounds pretty cool if it&#39;s not going too far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can assure you it’s extremely depressing yet stimulating. You are correct about the thoughts not being productive at all.</p>

<p>Just because of using TAK I am now considering going on TRT just to feel more human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>textbook ADHD PI + other symptoms of low catecholamines/ anxiety caused by sensitive HPA axis </p>

<p>Nothing worked for me better than IR Methylphenidate. Bromantane only worked for me for a few weeks. ALCAR taken orally is great but is converted to TMAO in the gut. Guanfacine is good but is only useful as an addition to a dirty stims.</p>

<p>TAK-653 I could see being very useful with any kind of reasoning. I’m just constantly under-stimulated by my structured work which is why I prefer Ritalin.</p>
