        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright. When taken together. What are your doses?
And what else is taken to synergize? </p>

<p>I’d like to combine Bromantane, Neboglamine, and TAK, the latter in smaller doses. </p>

<p>I have heard Bromantane, TAK, and tropisetron taken together is the business. </p>

<p>My reason. Productivity, running a business re branding and webpage. So physical labor and computer. Thank you all in advance. Your answers in the past have been extremely helpful. </p>

<p>Used to use adderall for computer stuff, and sometimes for product assembly. </p>

<p>Not in picture anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would first start with establishing doses and journaled experiences for Bromantane for 1-2 weeks, especially since it seems the half-life is elongated with IN dosing. Finding your maintenance dose as it works it’s magic is a solid foundation, and often more than enough for general improvement of motivation and drive.</p>

<p>It’s also incredibly hard to tweak or get a feel for improvements or side-effects when introducing multiple things at once (especially in regards to something like Bromantane that works epigenetically) so slow and steady becomes the only way to race without tripping yourself every other step.</p>

<p>Funny enough I’m also currently replacing my Dexedrine with it and my usual nighttime P5P/zinc and magnesium glycinate (necessary to make catecholamines and hormones which improve motivation as well), and using Mucuna Dopa 2-3x a week for those workhorse days. Going to also play around with adding Sabroxy this week as a DAT inhibitor to see if it helps or cuts down on what’s needed. Also still taking NAC as it greatly improves my hedonic tone and balance. </p>

<p>I’ve also been trialing MT-55 Kanna extract to upregulate VMAT2 (which amphetamines demolish), and I’ve found that not only did it make for a nearly painless WD from Dexedrine, but by enhancing cAMP, endorphins, and VMAT2 activity it makes for a nice cure-all for off days when I can’t afford to have the IQ of a tepid bucket of water lmao. I always wake up feeling “brighter” and more grounded after, and in a childlike flow-state of sorts where things feel exciting and welcome in casual creativity and desire to do things. Could just be the month of Bromantane showing benefits, but the addition of the MT-55 definitely feels like it helped patched something up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s your dose of the MT55? And are you taking daily or more as needed? I’ve been taking some every once in a while at small doses like 20 mg. I just took 25 mg a few hours ago right before a workout and man it really boosted the enjoyment of the workout. Wondering if I should be more consistent with the MT55.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually either go for 25g IN with some water after (don’t want my poor sinuses yelling at me lmao) 3-4x a week. Actually realized recently that I somehow made a new habit out of dosing after work around 6pm and then going on a 2 hour walk/hike— just reading, listening to podcasts, music, or mulling over thoughts and general self check-in’s.</p>

<p>I’ve found it really amps up this sense of childlike curiosity and desire to explore/learn, and also puts me in a good enough mood and sense of safety that I can easily approach and work through some trauma. Normally I just compartmentalize it if I know the thoughts won’t be productive— especially since it just compacts the learned fear when I’m not mentally stolid enough to work through it and get insights.</p>
