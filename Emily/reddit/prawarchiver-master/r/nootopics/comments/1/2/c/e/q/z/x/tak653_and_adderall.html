        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been on TAK for 10 days. I feel like things are finally building up.</p>

<p>What I notice.. big boost in beginning of day, and random parts of the day
-I feel somewhat stoked about getting out and crossing off the list of errands. 
-A nap mid day feels needed here and there,Then another spurt. 
-Emotions by end of day, depending on how busy, I feel like going to bed and not dealing with anyone. </p>

<p>-Dreams are definitely wild. Took a notch up in theme/settings. I love this part. 
-I also do not feel like eating after a 2-4mg dose in the morning (still trying to find sweet spot)
It’ll stave me off till a late lunch regardless. </p>

<p>I usually have adderall twice a week for the long days of typing content/shop hours. (1/3 of an XRS or 1/2 of a 30mg amp/dex. Yes pharma. </p>

<p>I stopped TAK for yesterday and today, was out of town. Felt like I’m still feeling the effects. 
Is it safe to have both at the same day? 
I’m aware of AMPA PAM’s but not all interactions. Must just ask the general question. </p>

<p>If they were ok, I would most likely significantly lower my doses on the adderall. Since TAK gives me odd energy spurts. 
Thank you all in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know if excitotoxicity is noticable when looking out for specific symptoms or can it be a silent-killer type thing? Is AMPAr usually the culprit or is it more about NMDAr? 
I&#39;m still on daily amps and initially thought I would combine with TAK (so I could probably lower amp dosage + other enhancement) but then later got a bit scared as it&#39;s a novel compound. I really want to trial TAK properly though at 1-2mg.</p>

<p>Any info appreciated!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. I could speculate, but you&#39;re never going to get the certainty that you crave. There&#39;s no definitive way to tell if you&#39;re experiencing excitotoxicity or not. Just that it&#39;s usually present in high dosages of recreational drugs such as meth or MDMA. And it can eventually present itself in cognitive and mood issues, as a result of the damage.</p>

<p>Do I think TAK-653 with amphetamine is excitotoxic? No. Not unless you&#39;re taking high doses of amphetamines. Do I have anything to prove that to you? No.</p>

<p>If you want to do your own research, maybe you could find something to cling onto and give you a transient sense of hope, but any doctor or responsible neuroscientist is going to tell you not to take this combo. And any noothead will tell you it&#39;s fine, and that they&#39;ve done worse.</p>

<p>Sorry that I can&#39;t give you a definitive answer, but I highly recommend <em>not</em> looking for certainty when there isn&#39;t. As in, unless it&#39;s explicitly demonstrated in the literature, don&#39;t kid yourself in thinking that for X reason or Y study you&#39;re for sure in the clear.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to do your own research, I suggest reading the wikipedia pages for AMPAr, Amphetamine, and Excitotoxicity. I also recommend going onto pubmed and looking up &#39;AMPA PAM excitotoxicity&#39; to see if there&#39;s any good hits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you everyone for your time and input. </p>

<p>Today I took 30mg of Neboglamine, and 2mg of TAK later in the day since I already have TAK build up. I feel like a Guinea Pig. But I took Nebo when I first woke up and a bit groggy. (First Time) I felt quite nice and fell back asleep.
Woke up 4 hrs later (my free day). Decided to stack TAK. 
Again. Hunger suppressed. May do light workout, go run with the dog. Who needs the exercise or you can feel his anxiousness emit! 
Then do the tasks for my business. </p>

<p>Again. Appreciate the time. 
I was curious about this because these are both stimulating, but don’t know the exact pharmacology, if mixing the two. </p>

<p>Either way, I’ll try myself. And definitely report</p>

<p>I know for sure.
TAK + Bromantane work incredible. Add a little Semax/selank (NA/Regular) later in the day. And that feels like a nice. 
Works best when you don’t work from home. And you’re either on job site, errands, home situation. 
Moving around. Makes it more stimulating personally instead of being strapped to the workbench at home. </p>

<p>Try to tread carefully here. </p>

<p>I have NSI-189, curious to how I will personally respond. But won’t be for a while because I still have another bottle of TAK And Neboglamine to individually trial. Then stack here and there.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying it will probably be ok when dosing both moderately?</p>

Oh yeah, I remember sirsadalot very very well.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m going to check out the pinned to his profile in regards to TAK653 you so kindly mentioned.</p>

<p>Preciate&#39; you!</p>

<p>PS edit-I have been prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD-PI for about 12 years now. It was one of those I tend to read about a lot that was diagnosed later in my life.</p>

<p>And boom the lights came on.
I had a really good relationship with Adderall XR until this shortage, and was switched over to Focalin XR, with a ton of trepidation. </p>

<p>And now after about 3 weeks taking it daily in the the for what it&#39;s worth category, I am blown away if you will, by Focalin XR 30 mg daily.</p>

<p>So far it has given me slightly better focus, allowed me to become even more outgoing which hasn&#39;t been an issue except for my teenage years and a little bit beyond being unbelievably shy, and finally stepping into who I am. </p>

<p>It seems to give me more controlled extroversion and I really feel like the attention is there even more so than Adderall IR and XR and most definitely Vyvanse which I took for a couple years some years ago.</p>

<p>***Sorry about the long winded PS as I thought I would add this in for anecdotal reasons, and perhaps maybe helps somebody out down the line or now. </p>

<p>Thanks again for the kind information!</p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t get any energy boost from TAK. Unlike with Tropisetron, that actually gives me mild boost for a few hours.</p>

<p>Actually, I don&#39;t think I &#39;feel&#39; anything after taking TAK, but I still take it for potential memory/IQ improvements :) Memory improvement is not something one can easily feel.</p>

Tropisetron didn’t do much for me, but I’m willing to give it a go. I had a 6 week detox from all nootropics. Long tour for music.
