        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Amphetamine Salts (Adderall) give me such incredible social grace, at just 10-15 mg.  I speak with great clarity.  I communicate effectively, both verbally and non verbally.  It also controls nearly every other ADHD Symptom.</p>

<p>Methylphenidate (10-20 mg) also controls nearly all my ADHD symptoms.  But it barely enhances my social grace…,sure it makes me extroverted and wanting to socialize….,but it only slightly (barely) improves my ability to communicate effectively.</p>

<p>What is it that’s unique about Amphetamine that enhances social grace?  </p>

<p>Perhaps some serotonin?  I’m unsure about that though, because it doesn’t seem to release much at lower doses.</p>

<p>Does it target some other receptors, neurotransmitters, processes, etc that are related to communication?</p>

<p>Perhaps Adderall has a stronger cholinergic effect and that’s why?</p>

<p>Would love to hear some thoughts….</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Methylphenidate tends to make me feel more robotic (i.e., flat affect). Amphetamine, less so.</p>

<p>Hypotheses:</p>

<p>1.) Amphetamine has more effect on serotonin. I&#39;m not even sure if Methylphenidate has any effect on serotonin.</p>

<p>2.) The difference in the firing patterns has some effect on your ability to socialize. For instance, amphetamine releases neurotransmitters which are then taken back up, whereas methylphenidate&#39;s reuptake inhibition possibly sustains the agonizing of receptors longer, leading to different psychological effects.</p>

<p>3.) Maybe the regions in which monoamines are being affected differ between the two. Perhaps Methylphenidate is chronically and indeterminately activating the PFC, which is suppressing emotional affect in the limbic system, causing anti-social behavior.</p>

<p>4.) The release of dopamine and norepinephrine is disrupting the usual balance of dopamine : norepinephrine : serotonin, which has an anti-social effect.</p>

<p>5.) Methylphenidate is causing greater activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which makes you anti-social</p>

<p>6.) The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate are in such a way that a subtle comedown hits, causing you to be antisocial.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s a whole host of purely psychological speculations I could make if you&#39;d like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a great list of ideas, thank you.</p>

<p>2 &amp; 3 really interested me.</p>

<p>That’s inspiring me to research more about how they affect the limbic system.</p>

<p>From what I understand they both strongly regulate the PFC, as that’s what’s thought to be the primary source of ADHD symptoms.  </p>

<p>So I’m thinking the limbic system is more involved with social (and emotional) behavior, while the PFC is more involved with logic and execution?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This brain region has been implicated in executive functions, such as planning, decision making, working memory, personality expression, moderating social behavior and controlling certain aspects of speech and language. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social &quot;control&quot; (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">Wikipedia&#39;s Prefrontal Cortex Article</a></p>

<p>Those functions obviously play a massive role in socializing, though perhaps not social motivation.</p>

<p>The amygdala is involved in fear processing and anger, which obviously have implications for embarrassment and irritability.</p>

<p>Anterior Cingulate Cortex may also be of note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in processing both the detection and appraisal of social processes, including social exclusion. When exposed to repeated personal social evaluative tasks, non-depressed women showed reduced fMRI BOLD activation in the dACC on the second exposure, while women with a history of depression exhibited enhanced BOLD activation. This differential activity may reflect enhanced rumination about social evaluation or enhanced arousal associated with repeated social evaluation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex#Social_evaluation">Wikipedia&#39;s Anterior Cingulate Cortex&#39;s Social Evaluation Section</a></p>

<p>This is also interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amphetamine, like methylphenidate, exerts its play-suppressant effect through alpha-2 noradrenergic receptors. On the other hand, cocaine reduces social play by simultaneous increases in dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin neurotransmission. In conclusion, psychostimulant drugs with different pharmacological profiles suppress social play behavior through distinct mechanisms. These data contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms of social behavior during an important developmental period, and of the deleterious effects of psychostimulant exposure thereon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this is in rats but...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The play-suppressant effects of amphetamine were antagonized by the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist RX821002 but not by the dopamine receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol. Remarkably, the effects of cocaine on social play were not antagonized by alpha-2 noradrenergic, dopaminergic, or serotonergic receptor antagonists, administered either alone or in combination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24057815/">Achterberg. et al&#39;s Amphetamine and cocaine suppress social play behavior in rats through distinct mechanisms</a></p>

<p>So, <em>blocking</em> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-2_adrenergic_receptor">α2 adrenoreceptor</a> stopped the &#39;play-suppressant&#39; effects of amphetamine <em>in rats</em>. Rats aren&#39;t humans though.</p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t know, the α2 adrenoreceptor (α2A) is reminiscent of a braking system on norepinephrine (NE) release. It&#39;s counterintuitive. NE is an agonist of the α2A receptor, but when the α2A is agonized, it slows the release of NE.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine">Guanfacine</a> which is prescribed to treat ADHD (and which I take) is an agonist of the α2A receptor. It &quot;inhibits the production of cAMP and closes HCN channels enhancing the effectiveness of the signal of the pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), thus improving working memory and attention,&quot;<sup>\</sup>)<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27254403/"><sup>link</sup></a><sup>\</sup>) which I&#39;m not even going to pretend to understand.</p>

<p>What it does for me in practical terms: alleviates every side effect of stimulants, crushes my anxiety, and improves aspects of planning and task initiation that stimulants don&#39;t touch.</p>

<p>However, if you&#39;re interested in an antagonist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohimbine#Pharmacology">Yohimbine</a> is one such. In fact, it&#39;s sometimes used in research specifically to agonize this receptor. The anecdotes online about it aren&#39;t too enthusiastic, though. They mostly report jitters, anxiety, high heart rate, and basically all the worst aspects of a stimulant with none of the positives.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>

<p>As for point two that I made, I don&#39;t have enough off-hand knowledge to comment on it. It really was pure speculation, so you&#39;d have to ask a neuroscientist if it&#39;s even something worth considering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really appreciate you extracting all that Info bro, it’s def helpful.</p>

<p>Guanfacine has always been of interest to me, though I’ve never taken it.  I do take Prazosin though which is an a1a antagonist, and supposedly similar to guanfacine, or at least in the same class I believe. Prazosin does somewhat help with the negative side effects.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about Guanfacine is it’s almost opposite of other ADHD meds, yet has been approved as a second line treatment.  That part about how it modulates the PFC seems to explain it well, but of course there’s probably much more to it.</p>

<p>That’s interesting about the play suppressant effect too, and the counter intuitiveness of how agonizing a2a reduces adrenaline (yet with a1a it seems you have to antagonize it to block norepinephrine.)</p>

<p>Yeah Yohimbine is really agitating, supposedly it’s a good aphrodisiac though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had always thought isolating the DexMethylphenidate isomer shifted the preference to dopamine more (although it does still affect both,) and hence the lower side effects of Focalin.  But I can’t find a clear answer.</p>

<p>I’m not too sure what exactly the effects of Levo methylphenidate are in isolation.  Some say inactive, some say mainly negative effects, some say it primarily affects norepinephrine (similar to levoamphetamine), some say it does have some therapeutic synergy with the DexMethylphenidate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but why would releasing dopamine cause more social grace, then just reuptake inhibiting?  I feel about the same dopamine boost from both….</p>

<p>but maybe there is something about releasing vs Reuptake inhibition that enhances social grace….but that begs the question why would releasing dopamine be more effective than just inhibiting reuptake?   Is it some pathway it affects?  Something downstream?  Or the “fresher” dopamine that gets released is more effective?</p>

<p>Just asking questions to speculate, sometimes the right questions is just as important</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%. Not only is it interesting but it would be beneficial to know where in the dopaminergic system my adhd has trouble with. Is it the release of dopamine? The re uptake? Or another factor entirely, possibly related to norepinephrine and cortisol? Because different medications and supplements act and react differently to different individuals. A patient is their own best advocate and we have to arm ourselves with knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said bro.  I hate how so many psychiatrists frown on us doing our own research.</p>

<p>Like I know you shouldn’t question their statements (even brazenly wrong ones) cuz that will annoy their egos.</p>

<p>But some get annoyed if you just say you read something and ask their thoughts on it….particularly if it’s a medication you think may match your particular constitution.</p>

<p>I feel like there’s so much info online that they’re unaware of, or not even that curious about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, both of them sure boost my libido.</p>

<p>Part of it I think is just that it makes me more effective at life though….when we feel better about ourselves and our lives, Mother Nature probably sees us as successful and wants to push us to recreate.  (Just a personal theory)</p>

<p>But no doubt the surge of dopamine is the primary aphrodisiac effect of stimulants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the benefits of taking tropisetron for you?</p>

<p>Bromantane supposedly stacks well with Adderall, possibly methylphenidate too.</p>

<p>Not sure about TAK</p>
