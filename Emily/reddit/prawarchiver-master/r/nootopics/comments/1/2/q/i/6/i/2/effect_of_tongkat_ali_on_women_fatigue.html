I (F24) generally have low energy and sometimes lack motivation. I have tried plenty of nootropics and i wonder how this effect the female body plus  I am looking for something new to try.  </p>

<p>P.S. I did a medical check, and it seems my tests are fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For energy i would recommend rhodiola rosea. I use it when i have school and work the same day and take it in the afternoon like at lunch from work and it removes the exhaustion sensation you get from working all day. Tongkat for me is mostly for confidence boost and drive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a female so can&#39;t directly answer your question, but when I was reading the literature on TA some time ago I definitely remember there are multiple studies that found a positive benefit in women, although this could&#39;ve been mainly athletic parameters that the studies looked at, but some looking at fatigue as well. </p>

<p>IIRC you can find some on the examine.com page for Tongkat Ali.
I could look some up if you can&#39;t find them! </p>

<p>As for experiences by females, it might help to cross-post in a much larger subreddit to increase chances you get some responses, like u/Nootropics.</p>

<p>Hope you&#39;ll find what you need!</p>

<p>Edit: Have you ever tried bromantane? This is really one of the best noots for motivation &amp; low energy in my opinion (and many in this sub will agree). It&#39;s especially effective in form of a nasal spray. </p>

<p>It&#39;s non-addictive and effects build up day by day. It&#39;s fairly unique in that it feels both mildly-stimulating as well as anti-anxiety. Works by increasing your natural dopamine production. No withdrawal when stopped, as it can actually keep working while it fades over the course of weeks (after multiple weeks of administration). In Russia it&#39;s prescribed for asthenia (which we call Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the west). It&#39;s also very safe as it has been around and used in humans for decades with practically zero side-effects as far as I&#39;m aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the info! </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read about the positive benefits of Tongkat Ali on women as well. I tried it today and got a nice energy boost.  I quite like it. Will test it for a while. </p>

<p>I was thinking about Bromantane! Gonna try it soon as well, ordered it today.</p>
