        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all!</p>

<p>Interestingly, I just got a phone call saying that I&#39;ve been bumped all the way to the top of the waitlist to receive ketamine treatment for depression (I was expecting a 6-12 month wait!). I had just received Neboglamine in the mail though and took my first dose lastnight with positive results. Between the subjectively positive experience and the promise the literature shows, I&#39;m confused as to whether I should just keep trying the Neboglamine or take advantage of this opportunity that, obviously, will not come around every day.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;m reading, it seems as though Neboglamine has similar mechanisms to ketamine, to some degree, and it has antidepressant properties. Now, I&#39;m left wondering: what do I do? I know y&#39;all can&#39;t give me medical advice, so I won&#39;t ask you to. I just want to know, based on your knowledge (or maybe experience, as well), does ketamine offer potential benefits over Neboglamine? Does Neboglamine offer benefits over ketamine? How do the mechanisms differ? Do you think, if you remove me from the situation and treat this as a hypothetical, it&#39;s worth trying ketamine? ..or is Neboglamine just superior and it&#39;s not worth giving ketamine a shot?</p>

<p>Any benefit or risk of taking them together? As in, ketamine one day, Neboglamine the next?</p>

<p>Any thoughts welcome (pm if you wish!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something to keep in mind is that, while TAK, agmatine, etc. (not neboglamine) are commonly cited to treat depression similarly to or the same way as ketamine, none of them are HDAC5 inhibitors. HDAC5 inhibition is thought to be another important mechanism underlying ketamine&#39;s antidepressant effects. HDAC5 inhibition + NMDA/AMPAergic action is probably more efficacious than NMDA/AMPAergic action alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ketamine literature seem to suggest an antidepressant effect of about one month in duration. That might be worth it to you to see what it feels like to have the veil of depression lifted. As for breakthrough treatments, the psilocybin and transcranial magnetic stimulation data seem to suggest a much longer antidepressant effect. </p>

<p>This might not be what you’re asking. But Neboglamine, or another over-the-counter (St. John’s Wort, saffron, fish oil, agmatine, etc.) might be better maintenance strategy after a ketamine or psilocybin trial. </p>

<p>Glad you’re delving into it yourself, as it is notoriously difficult to get advice on everything that’s out there. </p>

<p>Good luck, and keep us posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ketamine does not have a similar mechanism of action to Neboglamine. While it does act on NMDA, it is an NMDA antagonist, while Neboglamine is a NMDA Glycine Site PAM (Not to be confused with a NMDA PAM). NMDA antagonists are anticognitive, and even if they have some benefits in some areas, if taken long-term, they normally create a cognitive deficit in terms of memory or spatial cognition. If neboglamine works for you (and additionally pinealon/agmatine), then it makes more sense to use those as they have a benefit to cognition and longevity rather than creating a negative impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I take the ketamine, I may not be able to keep it in mind! 😆</p>

<p>Honestly though it seems like it won&#39;t be a problem. I will likely incorporate some doses of Neboglamine in between my ketamine to keep my cognition in check. Additionally, I feel that getting rid of the depressive fog will only help my cognitive abilities. We shall see. I am leaning toward giving it a shot.</p>

<p>I take 30 mg DXM a day just before my stimulant medication to potentially reduce neurotoxicity, and possibly even limit tolerance.  It’s hard to say if the pros outweigh the cons.</p>

<p>I somehow doubt that&#39;s been the subject of research (eg because ketamine is a controlled substance AND the antidepressant effect of agmatine seems only to have been discovered recently). Which is a shame, because it could be used to target ketamine therapy on people who&#39;d benefit...</p>
