        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, I&#39;ve been researching the a4b2 agonists, that the company, abbot and others were testing for adhd and everyone talks about abt-089. But how about ABT-894 (sofinicline). Instead of being a partial agonist it is a full agonist at that receptor. Two rather large studies have tested doses ranging from 2 mg to 6mg BID ( and possibly 8 mg) with beneficial effects being found for ADHD with a good effect size at 4 mg BID ( 0.45) in one study. This compound went all the way up to phase 2 and was just dropped. The kicker is that they matched this  head to head with a known ADHD treatment  (atomoxetine) and it showed comparable effect. This compound seems way more promising than ABT-089. What am I missing in my research, why favor one over the other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a full agonist builds tolerance faster. If you want a full agonist at nicotinic receptors- just use nicotine. Oh you don’t want to because it’s addictive and builds tolerance fast? Well there’s the answer to your question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nicotine is the best full agonist at this receptor site. I don&#39;t understand this well enough but stronger binding afffinity is what differentiates full and partial agonists, right? Although sofinicline is a full agonist it has weaker affinity than nicotine. Also Nicotine isn&#39;t as selective as this drug. Sofinicline only activates A4B2. Nicotine activates every nicotinic recptor along with A4B2.</p>

<p>Also if you look at the study i cite, the effects last at least a month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nicotine is the only full agonist know to be associated with addiction and that is not because of oral ingestion its because of rapid entry to the blood stream via smoking, and the fact that nicotine is the most potent agonist at this site. For example, phenylpiracetam is not associated with addiction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily want you to carry it, i just wanted someone to look deeper into it. Its a drug with just as much info and safety trials as ABT-089 and it seems like people haven&#39;t even heard of it.  It would be awesome if people investigate its use personally and we can get more confident info.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding, I appreciate your work and this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As it is claimed that phenylpiracetam does the same thing too, and is notorious of fast tolerance build up we can assume that same problem could potentially occur with this one too. </p>

<p>Partial agonists only may have lousy effect, but apparently just because of that there is not so much tolerance build up either, so in long term it may be winner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t cycling address the tolerance issue and in a brain that perhaps has adhd wouldn&#39;t upregulation of of A4B2 receptors lead to overall positive effect since you have more ach to activate the parts of the brain that are deficient.</p>

<p>Nicotine is an example of an A4B2 full agonist that does just this. If i remember correctly. It also has neuroprotective effects assuming you&#39;re not smoking it.</p>
