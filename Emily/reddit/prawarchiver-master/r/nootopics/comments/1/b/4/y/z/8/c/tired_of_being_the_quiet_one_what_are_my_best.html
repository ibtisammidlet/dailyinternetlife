        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have struggled with social situations since I was a kid. I would never have anything to say, which would cause awkwardness and lead to anxiety. Hard to explain but it is some kind of mental block that prevents me, kind of like writer&#39;s block except verbally. Occasionally I will have a good day and can actually be funny and charming, but this is quite rare. It has improved aa bit as I grow older, but very slowly.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I take enough caffeine to break though my tolerance, or get buzzed off of alcohol it is like a complete paradigm shift. Suddenly I can access all these memories to tell stories about, can come up with jokes on the fly and think of all these things to discuss. Obviously none of these are sustainable solutions.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A year ago I started taking NOW True Focus. It has l tyrosine, l phenylanine, DMAE as well as ginkgo and B vitamins. It was amazing. I could talk and talk and talk. I went from one word replies to typing whole paragraphs. I could have conversations with anyone without even consciously thinking about what I was going to sya next. It was easy to make friends and I even was able to go on a lot of dates and break a dry spell. I took it consistently for about a year without developing tolerance. But eventually it started causing severe acid reflux and I had to quit.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I am pretty lost without my little helper. Currently running bromantane but it&#39;s not really doing much. Thinking about noopept, racetams or even NSI-189. Any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Split daily dose in morning and evening of Magnesium l-threonate + 5g creatine + CDP choline + fish oil + no caffeine + work out 1/2 hour each day + eat paleo= anxiety gone + confidence. Cycle lions mane occasionally for its bdnf properties. Also, it sounds silly but convince yourself you’re having a good time by inner monologue and perpetual smiling. Reach out to people even if you don’t feel like talking because you’re reprogramming and conditioning yourself for a new way of living. If this doesn’t work reach out to a medical professional to properly assess your situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha I have a permanent little smirk. I don&#39;t focus on it much, luckily my mouth just quirks that way with a little effort. I actively try to look at the world in a kinder, loving way all the time and this affects the way my eyes look. I noticed early on that doing these little things completely changed people&#39;s perception of me. I go from serious and unapproachable to fun and approachable, without actually saying or doing anything different. It truly is a bit of a cheat code. The only downside is that you create an expectation. If I have a day where I&#39;m a bit tired and just not emoting much I get asked constantly if I&#39;m ok, as though something really bad must have happened. All in all, worth the trade off. Making people feel comfortable with your body language isn&#39;t an immediate thing, but over time they&#39;ll appreciate you more than the wittiest person in the room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal social stack is Istradeffyline, NAC, Sarcosine and Guanfacine. </p>

<p>Being healthy and making sure all your vitamin needs are met also helps (Cronometer). </p>

<p>MOST people are not social because they’re not driven enough or in that much of a good mood to socialise causing them to be in their head stopping them from doing so. </p>

<p>If your social anxiety is not severe and is just mild, cardio for around 20-30 mins really helps as you’ll get an endorphin release which in turn brightens your mood which in turn makes you more sociable and easier to talk to people.</p>

<p>Being buzzed or drunk just makes you not care about being judged what you talk about. It’s not that the memories are not accessible. It’s that your fear of getting judged for what you say is holding you back from saying it. It’s really hard to get out of this mindset without the use of nootropics, therapy or drugs. It comes from a lifetime of people pleasing or childhood trauma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just depends on personal chemistry. Got to experiment with lots of different things because everyone’s balance is different and find your own stack that works.</p>

<p>Tbh NAC has a reputation of dampening mood too but in my case it calms me down and brightens it because I’m naturally irritable and have intrusive thoughts so it gets rid of that for me. Like I said, all depends on yourself :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the best answer. propanolol plus exposure therapy seems to create a new baseline in ur brain for anxieties/phobias. there is a specific protocol that was shown to extinguish phobias in an astonishingly high percentage of participants. i wanna say it was 100% or close to 100%. alternatively, u could just take the propanolol as needed for use in social settings. if i understood the studies correctly, i think it could have the same effect along with making you less nervous while on the drug.</p>

Exposure therapy can be done without it but propranolol essentially blunts the process of learning from and storing negative memories, which accelerates the process .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all reality if you’re like me it’s just how you are. You can take things intermittently as maybe go through phases at the end of the day I’d focus on making sure you keep close friends close. Where you feel natural. 
As far as real social butterfly behavior it’s always been initiated by things that put me in a good mood. From alcohol to stimulants to phenibut etc etc. the key is to capitalize on those extra social experiences and try and carry them on by staying in contact with people you’re comfortable with.</p>

<p>For me that’s where oxytocin nasal spray comes in. I’ll respond to texts that I’d otherwise had ignored etc.</p>

<p>Gabapentin is a good substance too. 
I’ve not found any of what you’re looking for in cognitive enhancing substances like noopept.
There’s a balance between less thought and still maintaining motivation to engage. </p>

<p>Maybe a serotonergic or mao a inhibitor like moclebemide</p>

All in all if you can pay in crypto nootropicsource is better. Umbrella has been not on their shipping game lately either. 
I saw it on science.bio and would order it from there too.
I helped me a lot not much of an acute feeling but behavioral changes for about a day I could dose every other day and I think I’ve read the neural changes can lads for three</p>

They all increase my anxiety but what has helped the most are SSRIs, but not without side effects. All the ADHD meds like guanfacine or supplements like magnesium or CDP Choline just increased my anxiety levels. Something that has helped me the most is actually metroprolol. It block’s adrenaline so even if you do get anxiety you won’t feel the physical side effects as much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m the same as you and I’ve noticed phenylalanine helps a lot, I first noticed it as a kid when I once drank a bunch of diet snapples that say “warning: phenylalanine” and I was suddenly really sociable and I’ve since noticed other times that happened. I’ve tried a form of phenylalanine that contains two kinds (DL I think?) that apparently (as I later read from a sirsadalot post) cancel each other out, and I consequently felt no different using it. And then I stopped nootropics as it was really just unhealthy for me to keep attributing things in my social life to chemical causes instead of consciously thinking about them. But maybe I’ll see if I can get some l-phenylalanine or some of that True Focus. Also, kratom worked sometimes but it’s really hit-or-miss, also dextromethorphan cough medicine in not very high doses, but also hit-or-miss. Shrooms make me consciously address the things holding me back in my social interaction, they’re amazing but only like a once-a-year thing. Alcohol is fun but never constructive and it’s just unhealthy; it allows you to socialize by allowing you to ignore the things holding you back unlike shrooms which force you to address those things and get past them. Any connection you build with someone while drunk crumbles the minute you’re sober again.</p>

<p>Ultimately though, the fixation on the ability of substances to sometimes make your brain function better can distract you from focusing on actually materially making your life better. I was at the point where, whenever I was stressed out about something, I would just research what might fix my brain and allow me to fix my problems instead of just figuring out how to fix my problems. That said, I might go get some L-phenylalanine, lol.</p>

<p>Also I tried bromantane too and yeah it didn’t do much except make me physically kind of a beast, I had unlimited stamina and my resting heart rate was below 40bpm. But I didn’t really notice anything different mentally or socially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you appear healthy of mind, below are possible ideas.  Going back to the True Focus, possibly try another formulation.  Nearing 60, with past brain trauma, core supplements include high doses of specific B vitamins, DHA oil, phosphatidylserine &amp; phosphatidylcholine, anti-oxidants, key amino acids, ormus minerals... Or do a little work on your microbiome and give your gut some added love, and address the acid reflux, which is very doable. And continue what worked with you in the past.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It would be worth testing some GABAergic  pathways.  Rated from gentlest to stronger, via my experience and general feedback found in my use with others.  Rxes would be in the line of a valium, which is GABAergic, to understand the pathway  test I recommend.  Rxes in the benzo realm are the extreme.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Below are suggestion guides. Some of these are inexpensive, relatively safe and have some degree of efficacy, though anyone&#39;s experience may range due to individual neurochemistry.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ol>
<li>L-Theanine (amino acid prominent in green tea) extremely safe.  Can start with 200mg-400mg. and feel its impact.  Gentle for most,  low dose caffeine and l-theanine is a college study night or exam day remedy.</li>
<li>Lithium Orotate (essential mineral-capsules) helps regulate GABA/glutamate balance</li>
<li>PharmaGABA (otc) capsules or pills (may be better for night time use, my experience)</li>
<li>Herbs/Polyphenols (tinctures, extracts, capsules, teas) lemon balm, magnolia bark, polygala, *albizzia (one of my favorites)....there are more but these are relatively effective, in the realm of a calming/relaxing effect.</li>
<li>Selank (inhaled peptide) I consider it as a gentle nudge towards less inhibition and anxiety IF your anxiety is not excessive in public.</li>
<li><a href="http://actachemscand.org/pdf/acta_vol_35b_p0311-0324.pdf">Amanita Muscaria</a> (mushroom-capsule, gummy extract) One of my favorites. Day or night. 500mg to 1 gram</li>
<li>Phenibut (capsules with various doses) - Not meant for chronic use. I use for social situations where I want to energetically engage in dialogue.  That is it&#39;s effect upon me.  Slow acting and dose impacts effect.  I only do a handful of times in a month, if at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There are others, ranging from GlyNAC, sarcosine, magnesium to kratom and CBD.  Racetams, they may help. Fasoracetam with AlphaGPC or Citicoline, would be my first choice, from experience. But I&#39;d start with #1 above and see even if the impact is in the ballpark of what you need to engage more energetically in public. If not, then GABA pathway modulation is ruled out and you consider another path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) herbs like astragalus, ginger or licorice root are added to &#39;polyphenol&#39; blends because they enhance the efficacy of individual herbs and harmonize them. They are rock stars. Astragulus has several <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095754819301073">psychotropic pathways</a> impacting neural signaling pathways. I never used specifically, for that impact though, alone. My next tincture blend for psychotropics, I will include it.  </p>

<p>Thank you for the refresher.  Did you get any benefit?  I suspect solo it may be subtle in effect and likely better in conjunction with other herbs.  Like albizzia, polygala or magnolia bark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use it for the subtle calming effect at a low dose.  I micro-dose psilocybin and occasionally do a macro-dose to go &#39;default mode network&#39; and stimulate the sigma-1 receptor for some serious ionic calcium channel modulation at the mitochondrial level. No comparison, even going recreational with Amanita Muscaria, vs. psilocybin, which is seretonergic in action vs GABA. For me, they each have their use. They both are invaluable to my mental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Issue is that fly agarics what can be occasionally seen from window coming up during autumn do contain numerous substances both pro-glutaminergic, and pro-gabaergic + bufotenin what is more psilocybin kinda thing, and more dirty stuff. And their related amounts may vary heavily, also whether it is end-of-summer or late-autumn mushrooms.  So it is casino. Drying should turn it more gabaergic, or passing thru your body what I heard may give strong effect when eating mushroom itself does not. </p>

<p>But I just wonder if those capsules are purely muscimol extracted from Amanita what is GABA stuff, or extract as such containing everything from mushroom itself whatever happens to be there. </p>

<p>Used to try lot of those when young, but failed to get much of effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well your problem is apparently anxiety, and you have the association of reacting anxious in social situations. How you could break it, is taking propanalol it stops adrenaline and not adrenaline to bind in the brain. A lot of public speakers actually use it. Selank has strong anxiolytic effects. You could add a neurogenic compound like a low dose magic mushrooms, NSI,  noopept, dihexa. This solidifies the new habits of having fun in social situations and gives you the opportunity to have new positive associations with being social. 
I wouldn&#39;t do too many neurogenic compounds at once. Try one see how react than maybe add another one. That&#39;s enough dihexa + NSI is a good combi imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My current favorite stack and I’ve tried them all and even gotten clean from the whole list of narcotics (benzos, barbs, zopiclone, ambien, weed): but yeah best for me is: Daytime= x2 Relora (with magnolia bark) + x1 ashwaghnda and propanolol. Nighttime= x1 valerian root extract + Valerian/skullcap tea. Keep in mind this is the best I’ve found for really bad GAD and social anxiety, and might cause mild rebound anxiety if used everyday especially the ashwaghanda and Relora. On the flip side it cures most if not at all my anxiety and atleast makes it manageable to a point I don’t feel I need to isolate or drink. If it’s just mild everyday anxiety then magnesium and L theanine</p>

<p>And also, sodium is the only form that works for me for some reason sulfate is not the same, even when I space out the sodium doses. Come to think of it drinking sodium in a sports drink is the closest I&#39;ve ever been to taking something that is quick acting (like a vape).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High quality Kanna extract has become my favorite substance out of my pharmacopoeia of herbal remedies. It has a spiritual element to it that I appreciate because it is like microdosing without the negative feelings. I have found it to have practical uses as well as recreational potential. I’ve been in the studio recording an album lately and Kanna has become a new favorite amoungst the musicians and producers I’ve been working with. The creativity and music enhancement provided by nasal use of Kanna extract has had a profound positive effect on everyone involved in the recording process. I’m still trying to figure out the downside to this substance because if I use too frequently I experience a comedown</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. When I first got some, I was under the impression it was &quot;baby molly,&quot; a term often applied to the substance and I think- inaccurate. I always describe it to people who are interested as similar to a psychedelic micro dose. The feeling it promotes can be euphoric but the 15 minute come up before evening out is, to my mind, fairly indistinguishable from a &quot;low wave&quot; acid trip. The part of a full acid trip where you are certainly feeling it but not at the intensity of a peak. The wellness and relaxation that comes afterwards is also of the introspective sort that I associate with psychedelics. It seems to me, as best I can tell, to be a generally mild 15 minute psychedelic that maintains all of the lasting benefits of doing psychedelics without the need to experience the full brunt of a 4-8 hour trip. It may have a downside, but the upside to that level of convenience will always be a factor in its favor for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be yes. I never felt that way towards it though. The only negative I felt from it is that it could make me angrier, but not to a detriment</p>

<p>And also, sodium is the only form that works for me for some reason sulfate is not the same, even when I space out the sodium doses. Come to think of it drinking sodium in a sports drink is the closest I&#39;ve ever been to taking something that is quick acting (like a vape).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use it for the subtle calming effect at a low dose.  I micro-dose psilocybin and occasionally do a macro-dose to go &#39;default mode network&#39; and stimulate the sigma-1 receptor for some serious ionic calcium channel modulation at the mitochondrial level. No comparison, even going recreational with Amanita Muscaria, vs. psilocybin, which is seretonergic in action vs GABA. For me, they each have their use. They both are invaluable to my mental health.</p>
