        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it even sadder when my own friends and the people around me (we&#39;re all young teens/young adults) give in. It doesn&#39;t help how vapes have become so widespread in schools. It&#39;s so easy to share and concel nicotine and even thc nowadays, and it&#39;s worse when the youngest in society are the most affected. </p>

<p>Yes every problem is related to each other and it&#39;s easy to say Society in general makes more people sad and stressed, but still... we have failed in a lot of ways when it comes to drugs. We don&#39;t need another drug become commonplace.  </p>

<p>Edit: I mostly care about young people and the youth doing it because it&#39;s just sad seeing people give into that kind of culture and mindset when they could be so much more. Kids/teens are the most vulnerable and innocent in society. The fact that kids can vape in class is disturbing, and the fact that it&#39;s super easy to take weed in a vape and share it at school is even worse. It&#39;s way easier to do these things and not get caught, and it&#39;s also more potent and easier to over do it</p>

<p>Another edit: looks like this is being shared around and recommended to stoners now. Sorry but everyone knows how loud and obnoxious they are about their use on the internet with little regards for actual smart dicussion. So many people are also missing the point of this post as well....</p>

<p>I am talking about young people and how they abuse. Not why I want to take away your rights or anything else. Literally just that yet people want to create some debate over something I&#39;m not talking about. There are so many other places on reddit to do that god</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true but so many stoners are in denial of the effect is has on them (former stoner)

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that people are really bad at being introspective or conscience of everything they do, </p>

<p>And when they let a drug influence their mind, they don&#39;t realize little ways it takes away from their thoughts, memory, emotional regulation, and just standards. </p>

<p>They stopped caring about life and what they could achieve or the interesting things they could do and instead just care about continuing the high. </p>

<p>Because if people were actually really introspective and self-reflective they would be in much better places regardless if they did weed, but the fact is that most aren&#39;t, and that makes it more susceptible to making bad decisions and continuing those bad decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the opposite actually... My entire adolescence people used to call me &quot;Spock&quot; because I was so un-emotional... When I started using weed, I suddenly started having emotions again, and I began realizing more and more how much I had been living life with shallow goals/perspectives and basically shunning my inner child compeltely.</p>

<p>Weed actually helps me tap into my emotions in a very real way--and it is only through the assistance of weed that I have really understood what effects the trauma I have experienced in my life has had on me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you don&#39;t get typology but that&#39;s a different matter all together. Why don&#39;t I just judge people for smoking weed? Anybody who does that is probably really dumb in the way they talk and is stupid. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not toxic white knighting I&#39;m just sharing my opinion like how Stoners will share their opinion on the internet saying to smokeee it do ittt. So that&#39;s not &#39;toxic white knighting&#39; or you&#39;re just calling it that because you don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying and this threat and subreddit isn&#39;t on your side? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do get typology, and it is a complete waste of time.  You like to put people into boxes, whether they fit or not, because you would rather have that power/control over them instead of actually listening to people.</p>

<p>So far this entire thread has been on my side, actually.  Yes, you are being a toxic white-knight.  This entire post and your posts subsequently are just judging people for doing something you can never understand and it makes you scared.  If you weren&#39;t being a judgemental prick about it, your wording would be drastically different than it is and would actually focus on the <em>root cause</em> of all this usage that bothers you so much rather than looking at the medicine people are using to cope.</p>

<p>You are judging people, and you&#39;re ignorant to how the world actually works.  Instead of debating and discussing with me you&#39;ve chosen to just attack and have added literally nothing of value to the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you need to see people like that to know they exist? I’ll volunteer. I’m 33 and legally prescribed cannabis for cptsd from my time in the military. I’m in a successful profession making 6 figures. I’m a mom of two. Happily married. I’ve never been addicted to a drug in my life and use all my controlled substances sparingly which are adderall and clonazepam. Weed raises my threshold for what I can tolerate in my daily life. I’m not snapping at my kids or being over stimulated. I think your view is very narrow. I don’t think anyone should use it until their brains are fully developed at 25. Kids do what kids will do and even when I was a kid, and my mom was a kid, kids found weed. The day I see marijuana be just as harmful and deadly as alcohol will be the day I agree with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do know they exist. They always do, and I read a lot about this and I do run into those people on the internet but you have to remember that there&#39;s a degree of self-selection. You never see someone posting about how it hurt them or ruin their life and you never see it getting popular. All those people aren&#39;t going to be on the internet and their stories aren&#39;t going to be heard. </p>

<p>The people who can handle it to where it is a net positive in their lives are in the minority especially when you consider just the young generation and all the unique difficulties they are facing. </p>

<p>My point is that if you have more of a bad thing in society and that bad thing hurts the vast majority of people who do it, then overall it&#39;s a bad thing for society. I mean I just think most adults aren&#39;t aware of how this generation is developing. It&#39;s not just the drugs it&#39;s the combination of everything that turns the drug use into something worse, not really in the ways like they used it in the 60s for example. </p>

I listened to your one sided rant but clearly you have no respect for others experiences hence your response to that mom. You are way too naive to have the world all figured out my friend. Spend time in prison. Have a child out of wedlock. Suffer from debilitating schizzoaffective disorder for 20 years. Have your father flat ghost your family at 16 years old. Fight an addiction to crystal meth for 5 years. Then tell me weed is ruining the world….. if it weren’t for weed I wouldn’t have survived any of my hardships. I’ve been dope free since 2015, dry from alcohol for over a year, and off thc for 6 months. Not everybody has the liberty of only worrying about self enlightenment bro, some of us make mistakes and have to learn the hard way. I quit weed cuz it doesn’t mix well with my psych meds. I would give anything to go back 20 years and have my father be a pot head. Maybe he and my mother wouldn’t have beat the fucking shit out of me n my sibling. So before you post shit like this please remember not all of us are living a fairytale like you. I mean that in the most respectful way possible. You wouldn’t survive a day in my life. And you have the audacity to judge others for getting a buzz? Like how do you know what they’re going through????</p>

<p>Dug up is a funny term when you have a single digit post count. I&#39;d hoped to find something, anything to help support your points or indicate anything about your background knowledge but of course, given that this is reddit, that is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Honestly the fact you can&#39;t see the irony in someone  testing a grey market, experimental drug without medical oversight or recommendation, experiencing a rare negative side effect, and then going on to rant about how bad it is for people to use a grey/black market drug without medical recommendation says more than enough about your self awareness.</p>

<p>I can definitely see why you sought out nootropics, sorry to say most of them do nothing. You&#39;ll have to cure your ignorance on your own</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think nootropics ARE drugs that influence the mind. There can be a spectrum of harmful to beneficial psychoactives, but in the end it’s up to each individual to determine what compounds or stacks word for the desired outcome. I’ll give two examples, caffeine and lsd. Are there people that find both caffeine and lsd to ALWAYS be harmful? Absolutely. Are there people that find both caffeine and lsd to ALWAYS be beneficial? Absolutely not. There’s nuance to it. Caffeine may be beneficial in the morning or for an early afternoon pick me up, but before bed, forget about it. Is it desirable to be in the lsd space for a significant chunk of one’s life? Almost certainly, no. But do some individuals experience great cognitive and healing benefits from that space from occasional use? Definitely! I hope I don’t come across as argumentative, because I do understand your point and I have found cannabis to be harmful for me. But that’s my point, harmful for me, no necessarily others. Cannabis can be a tool at certain parts of one’s day or one’s life that can be of great benefit. As you said as long as one is conscious of that cost benefit analysis, rather than using as escapism. Great post and great discussion :)</p>

<p>I think your problem is worrying about other people&#39;s inevitable actions. Your whining ain&#39;t doin jack to a multimillion dollar industry.

<p>Okay fine I&#39;ll give you good advice that will satisfy you regardless of sobriety, instead of getting upset at the truth (me, I am him, I AM THE TRUTH COCKSUCKA ♥️😹😸🐱🐈) Go watch some Aria Lee porn or footjob shit.

NO. So shut up and smoke this reefer hahahahahaha you&#39;re like a skateboarder complaining about cars and factories okay.... You&#39;re on your period. I&#39;m like an alien related to fish.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, bud. Elder millenial here. It was plenty easy to get weed and be high all day or get high in school before legalization and vapes. It was much higher risk sure, if you got caught, but it was a consequence problem and not a supply problem. Liquor was also super easy to get, and cigarettes we could buy ourselves usually </p>

<p>If there&#39;s a difference now it&#39;s one of degree or appearance, not some catastrophic paradigm shift. Kids have been doing dumb shit and getting high on things for decades and we make it out just fine. Mostly. Your generation is the most law abiding, peaceful, cooperative, healthy, and goal oriented we&#39;ve ever had.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t let the fucking adults around you bum you out my man. The adults who work around kids have been lying and telling them the world&#39;s gonna end over stupid bullshit since I was a kid at least. Now they might actually be right about it ending, but it&#39;s not cuz your friends are getting high.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you can&#39;t say the same thing for marijuana or a lot of other drugs which have a lot of negative studies on. </p>

<p>I think a lot of people in the nootropics Community would disagree with you with the health problems thing because they&#39;re pretty safe, and the worst that most people get out of them is that it doesn&#39;t work for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, I, myself had started smoking weed when I was 15, first few years it was all fun and games until I started to depend on it to feel &#39;normal&#39;. My brother was the one who introduced it to me- I don&#39;t blame him for any of it, we were just having fun but seeing the effects it had on him over the years really started to make me question it all. The thing is people today don&#39;t look at weed has a hard drug- such as heroin and coke, they take a light approach on it because no one has ever overdosed (you actually can&#39;t) or die from it which I guess helps but the effect it can have on can really damage you long term. </p>

<p>Like my best friend&#39;s cousin, he started smoking when he was 17 and when he turned 26 he became schizophrenic. It was noted that he did have some (brain problem) something along that, I&#39;m not 100% sure but the weed definitely played a huge part in causing his schizophrenia. Since he&#39;s stopped but evidently it was too late.</p>

<p>In the end what I&#39;m trying to say is, I personally do thing Weed is more dangerous than people make it out to see, yes you can&#39;t OD or die from it but it can cause serious damage especially if you can&#39;t control yourself/ abuse it. I&#39;d say in a way it is addictive once your body gets use to it and the munchies of course if you can&#39;t control yourself will make you gain a lot of weight from it.</p>

<p>If you abuse it and let yourself be controlled by it then YES- WEED is a danger to society</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was the weed in isolation, but I believe it contributed. I smoked almost every day between the ages of 19-24 while isolating myself and playing video games. Doing that while my brain was developing can&#39;t have been good. Now, I was also living in a toxic environment at the time and I have depression and anxiety in my family, so there&#39;s that to consider. Trauma and chronic stress can wreak havoc all by themselves.</p>

<p>What&#39;s very clear for me though is that weed makes me stupid the day I smoke it and for some time after. I lose motivation, focus, and drive. I get brain fog and feel dissociated, socially awkward, and I can&#39;t find words as well as I would at baseline. It&#39;s a poison for me personally, but I used it to numb myself to my toxic situation in the past and I notice that&#39;s what&#39;s happening if I ever use it here or there in recent years (it&#39;s always a maladaptive coping mechanism).</p>

I spent like 4-9 hours writing each track over the past 18 years.
It&#39;s art music so you can create the genre yourself if you are able to.
I use ableton live 11 legally and hardware/keys/deep introspection/yoga meditation states to create music for you
Hope that you digg it! :)
Please look

But if you looked into what weed does to the brain and find studies that state that smoking weed leads to psychosis &amp; schizophrenia. Luckily my father made me promise that I’d never use drugs. And I kept that promise. My father’s passing made that promise an even stronger reason to keep my promise. When I was fifteen years old I learned that even Tylenol damages the liver. I stopped taking Tylenol after I learned this. When I learned that alcohol was bad for the brain; I stopped drinking. I didn’t consider alcohol to be a drug but it really is a terrible substance. It’s sad and disgusting to see so many weak people fall into using substances. I’m glad I am strong enough to say NO to ALL that crap and do better for myself.

<p>Now I don&#39;t think it was like it was in the 60s, but with the ills of modern society and kids growing up with technology and social media and more potent stuff, it is worse all together. </p>

<p>I mean just think about nicotine. Kids can now do it in school in classes or inbetween classes very easily, and it&#39;s far easier to get more of nicotine out of a vape quickly versus a cigarette which you have to burn through.</p>

<p>Edit: I know there are other statistics that show a stronger rise but they&#39;re a little harder to find. I know for a fact that a lot of the anti-tobacco games we&#39;ve made in the 90s have been reversed by nicotine vapes in the last 10 years</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting data. I wonder if this rise can be attributed to a decline in using other drugs, or if all drug use is rising. Either way, why?</p>

<p>As an ex-smoker who started in high school, we found ways to smoke between classes. We would split cigarettes between people. So I&#39;m not sure how much convenience is playing a role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well vaping is seen as cleaner than cigarettes, there&#39;s less stigma since it&#39;s not like your lungs are being damaged you&#39;ll get cancer. </p>

<p>And again it&#39;s way easier to get more nicotine into your system through a vape then cigarettes. Idk that stats but a single thing of something is equivalent to a lot in packs of cigarettes. </p>

<p>And I mean you would agree with me that being able to conceal this stuff and use it indoors and hidden away from teachers or family makes it way easier to show it and spread it to others and also to keep the habit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is more an issue with how we as a society are adapting to the new technology of cannabis distillate vapes, rather than an issue with weed itself.</p>

<p>Weed is one of the oldest medicines we have as a species.  It’s also one of the least toxic and most versatile, and can put many severely life destroying diseases and conditions into remission, or at least support the patient in their daily maintenance.</p>

<p>We have seen how it has reduced the need for more harmful pharmaceuticals like benzos and opioids, and also how it provides an alternative to abusing alcohol recreationally.</p>

<p>It is a problem that we are seeing cannabis vapes being abused in schools by children and young people, but this is cultural.  The continuing taboo status of cannabis means that kids grow up being taught by their parents and teachers that “weed is bad”, so when those kids have access to the internet and can see that it’s way less harmful than they’ve been told, naturally they see it as being totally safe to go balls-deep in on.</p>

<p>In contrast to growing up in a household with a healthy relationship to alcohol, where your parents will teach you how to drink safely and avoid the dangers whilst having a good time in moderation.  There are nowhere near as many parents doing this with weed, plus it is easy to access as a minor due to its semi (or fully) clandestine legal status.  </p>

<p>This is a perfect storm leading to a beneficial herb being used incorrectly, causing harm where <em>it really shouldn’t</em>; you then see this happening around you and form a negative opinion about this precious, infinitely useful substance.</p>

<p>Much love, I hope this situation improves through better education, better laws, and more open-mindedness around cannabis, so maybe one day you get to see it for what it is instead of your opinion being understandably influenced by the negative consequences of a mismanaged society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We pretty much agree. I will always hold the assumption that the best version of yourself for like 97% of people is without it, unless of course you need it for pain related reason. </p>

<p>I just think we&#39;re really failing when it comes to our younger generation and nobody really knows about it or is really talking about it. It&#39;s a silent issue, and I think in part why we&#39;re not talking about it is because it&#39;s depressing. </p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t mention this, but weed is more potent, and the youth are more stressed and depressed, so two and two together and it leads to worser (not a word I know) outcomes than say people doing it in the 60s. </p>

<p>I think Vapes in general were super depressing to be around in schools because they spread so quickly and it was really disturbing that they could be used on campus, even in class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vapes are definitely a lot more potent than herb.  The plant itself hasn’t really changed over time, there has always been high potency cannabis growing naturally in some parts of the world, but the access to quality sources has improved dramatically.</p>

<p>Honestly though I can’t agree that the best version of ourselves is without cannabis for 97% of us.  Most of us have the capacity to use it in a way that enriches our lives, but we aren’t raised in an environment that facilitates learning how to do this.  </p>

<p>There’s no problem with it being legal, cheap and accessible for purely recreational reasons, but we have to accept that it’s a part of life and teach our teenagers how to use it properly instead of shunning it away and letting our kids figure it out for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a graph online that shows how it has increased in potency on average (thc content). So yes, some parts of the world may have always had it or read it but now it&#39;s becoming the norm. I think most people will realize that the weed they smoked in the 60s is not the same as the weed now. </p>

<p>And with the 97% thing, I just think fundamentally it isn&#39;t beneficial for a cognition, especially in the ways most people use it, and especially when you have foolish and inexperienced young people doing it. Of course everyone here is smart and everyone that&#39;s going to see this post that does weed probably does it in a smart way and is able to manage that well. There is some self-selection bias here and on the internet in general. The people that have done it and have ruined their life or have made themselves duller aren&#39;t going to be on certain places online posting about this stuff.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s my problem if it&#39;s legal cheap and accessible that means it&#39;s way easier to turn around and illegally put it in the wrong hands, and the more you normalize it, the more you make young people think it&#39;s a okay and legitimate thing to do, which leads more people to try it which in in the vast majority of cases they lose because of it, they become less.</p>

<p>Delta 8 is a good example of this because any adult can just buy it from a gas station and not just dispensary or dealer and turn it around to kids, or you can have people that are just 18 that can just buy it and not need a medical card (which in some places you can get at 18), which by the way medical cards are pretty b******* because you could just lie and say you need to sleep or have anxiety. </p>

<p>I mean getting a medical card is just an extra defence to continuing your use for a lot of people. And the fact that they make it 18 and not like 25 when your brain stops developing is another matter. It&#39;s very clear that Society doesn&#39;t care and that we&#39;ve let this taken over and there&#39;s nothing we can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t you think that the more it becomes normalised, the less harms we will see from its use?

<p>Nobody really loses or becomes less through using it either.  Of course if someone gets really stoned you’ll notice that perhaps they don’t seem as sharp or engaged as usual.  This is normal.  It wears off with little to no after effects and you go about your day.  </p>

<p>If you decide to spend all day stoned and not functioning, that is your own decision.  Some people with other existing problems may have more trouble with avoiding this, but at the end of the day, it’s not a substance which wires your brain into a full-blown chemical addiction (mild “withdrawals” aside).  Others (usually consumers in their 20s or older) find it beneficially supportive to their active and high functioning lifestyle.</p>

<p>I know you haven’t mentioned this but I feel like it might be coming - many people including medical professionals would have you believe that cannabis causes or increases the risk of developing schizophrenia.  Why, then, has schizophrenia remained at 1% of the population since the ‘60s when cannabis use has absolutely exploded during that period of time?</p>

<p>A lot of our perception about cannabis is still tainted with reefer madness and war on drugs era propaganda.  There are many powerful players with a vested interest in keeping it prohibited, as it will eat into their market share in pharmaceuticals, alcohol etc.  </p>

<p>Try thinking about it from a different perspective, I can see it’s making you sad but perhaps it doesn’t need to be that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit&#39;s AI is just showing this to Marijuana users (myself included) to get more eyes on your post and get a (hopefully polite) discussion going </p>

<p>I agree that companies marketing tobacco and drugs to kids is probably not well-intentioned and entirely aimed at making a profit at the expense of their ignorance/innocence</p>

<p>However, these suppliers exist because there is a demand.</p>

<p>Lets face it everyone is on drugs, including young people, simply because it is human nature to be very curious about substances. If it&#39;s not weed or nicotine it was alcohol when I was younger. Plus young people are generally addicted to social media, depressed, and bored so of course they will gravitate towards drugs</p>

<p>Sure I feel bad for kids who are struggling with drugs because our culture is so drug obsessed. But if someone likes weed they will continue to use it, even if it&#39;s obvious to most other people drugs aren&#39;t always the answer</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel bad about my own affinity for substances. As long as I&#39;m not wasting my life away burdening other people, or corrupting my non-drug using friends, I&#39;m not apologetic about my substance use</p>

<p>Young people will figure it out for themselves. We should only support drug dealers and companies that act with integrity and demonstrate at least some level of morality when deciding how to market and sell any substances</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the REM sleep is impacted negatively. REM sleep is obviously important for health. In practice, the body is highly adaptable and the negative effects on REM sleep can be somewhat mitigated by abstaining from use a few hours before beginning to fall asleep. </p>

<p>It is probably worthwhile to note that plenty people use the substance daily and are capable of quite a lot. And there are famous long-term users who have achieved higher levels of financial “success” (and presumably, self-actualization) than majority of folks on this thread.</p>

<p>Yet the people who have had their lives dulled and brains ruined aren&#39;t butting into conversations irl or online talking about it, unless of course they&#39;re trying to get help. r/leaves </p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the vast majority of people who did it saw negatives as studies suggest and based off what we know about it&#39;s mechanism of action. </p>

<p>But nooo focus on the celebrities or all the good cases to justify your use or some Reddit or boasting online how cool they are because they do something. It&#39;s only going to get worse, it&#39;s a perfect storm. Also realized these posts are being recommended to people who are into marijuana as well. Most people in real life aren&#39;t on Reddit.</p>

Not to mention the dissociation while sober as well. Overactive mind that was constantly overstimulated. Made a full stop 4 months ago and flushed all my stuff down the toilet. </p>

<p>Idgaf if the science says weed isn’t inherently addictive. I think it is. From what I’ve seen so many people who smoke it are addicted and lie to themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve done a wide arrange of drugs at a young age, but damn weed gave me PTSD  I actually realized this only a few weeks ago. I had times where I’ve hallucinated awful things that I don’t even want to talk about, and in the moment thought they were real, on edibles. Most of the time weed just worsened my mental health, sending me into panic attacks and feeling the worse anxiety and dread of my life. I’ve even had a bad trip on acid and mushrooms, and they weren’t as bad as weed. But I know some people can have the same traumatizing experiences on psychedelics too. 
My cousin is 24 and hasn’t worked in 6 years. Lives w his mom and younger brother. All he does is smoke all day. If my aunt doesn’t give him money for weed, he threatens to kill himself and goes ape shit on everyone. I’ve know him all my life and he’s so sweet. But he is so addicted to weed, he needs it to function. We can’t get him help because every time she calls cops on him, he acts all normal when they get there lol. We just want him to get better. 
I want to get better too. I haven’t smoked weed in a couple years but i struggle with other addictions and it’s just exhausting. I abuse my medication. I did quit drinking 4 weeks ago. But addiction is so hard for some people to get over. 
At times I love drugs and want to do them all. But I’m reality I don’t think they hold benefits anymore. I want to say psychedelics and k do, but I just don’t see it anymore. If you want a spiritual awakening, you have to do the work not just take a drug. 
Idk I’m very back and forth on this subject. I guess I’m a hypocrite because I take prescriptions. 
Another note- I feel like everyone I know has a mental health disorder of some kind. And I really think weed exasperates that. Idk some people say it helps, but I just don’t think so. 
I think it’s a big risk. I have no psychosis or schizophrenic tendencies except when I smoke weed. After quitting weed I’ve never experienced it again. 
But drugs probably won’t ever go away. So I guess you have to watch some people become slaves to them. And for me I have to watch myself become a slave to drugs too, then I got to pick myself back up again every time and get sober. I always think it will be the last time I have to get sober but it never is and it’s just like - what’s the point anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit smoking pot on 2/25.. I think I was smoking to shut my thoughts up, my power being handed away. But it made me very open to manipulations through media and tv. Having a harder time completely severing myself from alcohol. But I feel it putting me into a low chakra. For now it’s progress not perfection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very sad to see how people don&#39;t understand how silently and maliciously it affects you, it makes you lesser. As someone else said, it&#39;s like mind control and for the people that really make it a part of their personality it just &#39;ruins&#39; them. </p>

<p>And I agree with you in that people comparing it to alcohol is really stupid because they&#39;re both harmful and they&#39;re both drugs but in different ways. </p>

<p>Everyone in my life who is a frequent user that has started it when they were younger I&#39;ve grown up not to do that much meanwhile everyone that I know that didn&#39;t do it have achieved a lot more. And it&#39;s pretty obvious who is happier with their lives. I think if you spent a lot of time online you will realize that a lot of people themselves have noticed the same pattern, I mean if you just talk to older people that&#39;s generally what they&#39;ll say with what they saw in life. And I think people also neglect your points on how it&#39;s worse today because it&#39;s more potent and it&#39;s used to numb people from how divided and toxic our society and technology has become. </p>

<p>Hopefully as time goes on the scientific community can figure it out as studies come out and knowledge becomes better.</p>

You can pretend like it sounds like he&#39;s trying to take things away from you but he&#39;s really not he&#39;s just trying to express his opinion on how things could be better a certain way. I know there are plenty of Stoners online that will say that everyone should try it and they will be really boastful about it and preach it nobody tells them that they&#39;re wrong. </p>

Of my core group , six are dead for these reasons. I have some that are still here but their lives were basically ruined because of drugs which always seem to cross over with alcohol. It’s a dead end. It ruins lives , steals parents from kids and spouses from each other. It seems like fun when you start out but then it kills all your ambition and numbs your emotions.

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I believe people should have the right to consume drugs recreationally, in a safe environment. Secondly, the regulation of drugs creates a safer drug environment for everyone. Whilst Weed might be spreading, alcohol use (at least where I live) has been becoming replaced by cannabis use. Cannabis certainly does less harm than alcohol and whilst being addicted to anything is harmful, if people are using cannabis INSTEAD of alcohol then overall it’s better for society. </p>

<p>Additionally any effort to ban its use will often lead to worse drugs taking its place. Your notion of getting an F- rather than just an F is a bad comparison in my opinion. For example when Spice first emerged in the UK (as a legal substitute for cannabis) it quickly became popular and the drug was banned. Subsequently the drug producers kept tweaking the molecules slightly and producing even more unpredictable, stronger versions of spice. Spice was unequivocally worse than cannabis in almost every way, yet people used it because it was often easier to acquire. By trying to stop mostly harmless drug use, the government inadvertently caused the rise much more dangerous and harmful drugs. It’s not just an F- and an F, we are talking potentially life-ruining, psychosis inducing drugs versus something you might do once a week with friends.</p>

<p>Doctors prescribe opioids like they&#39;re smarties but the rest of society just can&#39;t handle the fact that weed isn&#39;t in the same class of drugs that most pharmaceuticals are.

<p>And the sad thing for people that are self-medicating is that for a lot of them it&#39;s not going to make things better. Most people get more anxiety over time when they are becoming dependent on it for anxiety and it just becomes a cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people that want to try will find the information online to consume it properly, you&#39;re telling me you can&#39;t find info on reddit lol? </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying a lot about ADHD meds that you don&#39;t know about, if anything vilifying ADHD meds and being ignorant about the kinds that are out there hurts people who think the only option is instant release Adderall which isn&#39;t true, amphetamines and you have methylphenidates and delivery of each of them can be immediate release or varying forms of longer release, there is no one size fits all. There&#39;s also NRIs and DRIs like Strattera and Wellburtin and guanfacine more so for hyperactivity. But nooo because METH. Not to mention all of these can vary in doses and how much you dose per day everyone is very different when it comes to this and people need to try multiple medications before they figure out which one is the one for their ADHD. And there&#39;s even more unconventional options outside of that that can be prescribed off label not just those. </p>

<p>But we should totally convince people to do weed for ADHD because weed hasn&#39;t been proven in studies to show lower outcomes lower cognitive performance lower emotional control etc etc. You&#39;re just ignorant about the ails of marijuana and you clearly read enough science in this thread, because that&#39;s what the science is going to say it when studies come out because that&#39;s what we already know. r/leaves weeps at you</p>

Everyone in this subreddit is looking for a way to enhance their cognitive function or relieve symptoms.  Cannabis is part of my daily pain management regime. I think that education and compassion are the two most impactful things we can offer the world at large.   Teaching people of the ways these various compounds can assist them in achieving their goals, as well as the side effects.  Lots of herbs and plants are better than hard drugs. Look around your community and ask yourself how prohibition is going.   I think ultimately we can only be in control of our own body, and only we can know what is right for us.<br/>
I think that psychedelics will play an important and pivotal role in society in the coming decades.   We will need to heal. I believe we will use these ancient tools to rediscover what it&#39;s like to have compassion after we realize the damage we&#39;ve done to ourselves with social media.</p>

<p>Alchohol is a drug. It&#39;s actual poison. These two things should never be considered in the same class of anything. Alchohol is horrible to the body and wrecks lives. I still don&#39;t think it should be illegal though. </p>

<p>Weed also affects different people differently. I see all these posts about how weed make them do this or that, or think less, it just isn&#39;t true. People just need things to blames things on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social media spreading through society is far worse. Weed is plus and minus, like anything. Proper use leads certain types to creative motivation and breaking through the homeostasis of collective thinking. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re hanging with bro-dudes and doing it, it is detrimental, like taking a Porsche off roading.  The negative reinforcement of a abuse is celebrated in the goal of getting &quot;fucked up.&quot; </p>

<p>For thinkers, people who read intellectual material, for artists, and for those who use it to actually look for enhancement  of specific thought processes, it is a useful tool. Likewise athletes who think through their bodies, it can be quite enhancing </p>

<p>I discovered this as a mountain runner in Alaska. It enhanced my ability to read a trail, or plot a course across a succession of switchbacks. I could see exactly where and how leap on and over rocks and to angulate my body and adjust my balance in a way I could not do previously, and I learned from the disruption of the homeostasis brought on by THC, as well as the sensorial enhancement induced by the state of mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My life has been changed more positively by microdosing and microdosing psilocybin mushrooms than any pharmaceutical ever prescribed to me to help me not feel miserable. We are loaded up with coffee to keep us productive, alcohol to keep us unaware, and SSRIs to keep us numb despite horrible dissatisfaction with a system that only serves the people in the top few percent. Psychedelics have a better safety profile than alcohol, cigarettes, and cannabis and don’t have addictive effects. They aren’t illegal because they are physically harmful. They are dangerous because they wake people up. Once enough of us wake up then we stop being miserable, robot consumers and the system crumbles. Can’t have that.</p>

<p>All of this to say, a system set up to make us all start to want numbing ourselves as soon as possible is a much bigger problem than people smoking cannabis. It’s less dangerous to individuals and to society than alcohol which teens also consume. The gap between wages and cost of living is absolutely obscene. We all got sold a lie that if we got good grades and went to college we’d get good jobs and be able to buy houses and live happily ever after. Instead, there are people with masters degrees bartending barely affording crappy apartments because the job market is weird after Covid, we are paying more for food relative to income than we ever have because companies got greedy, and a generation is drowning in predatory student loan debt. Young people are watching all of this and just trying to cope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, my point about mushrooms is that there are helpful medicines that are illegal and stigmatized and pharmaceuticals and things like alcohol that are socially acceptable and destroying people. My brother uses cannabis daily for social anxiety and back pain and is a great dad and husband, owns his own home, and has a successful career. He’s a recovering alcoholic, sober for almost 20 years now. He almost ended his life because of alcohol. Maybe take a look at your assumptions about some of these substances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, rather it doesn&#39;t seem harmless. You don&#39;t see the hidden ways it takes away from your drive or motivation or memory or emotional regulation. It&#39;s slow and creeping, and numbs most people into staying where they are. </p>

<p>Obviously genetics play a role but they&#39;re just too many stories out there people watching others in their lives just stagnate and get worse because of it. And that happens to most people when they try it, it&#39;s just common sense that your motivation disappears when you prioritize it. Not everyone is like that but the vast majority is. </p>

<p>People could be better but in this world where we&#39;ve lost all our standards and we think everything is bleak it&#39;s no wonder we&#39;re turning to drugs, it&#39;s no wonder we&#39;re more depressed. Our standards are gone and we&#39;re letting it all creep up on us. </p>

<p>Weed is one of the most nefarious drugs to do for someone who&#39;s personality particularly addictive because it just sneaks in, and people don&#39;t stress the addiction risk with THC which is why some people succumb to the addiction. It&#39;s not as much weed itself and it&#39;s the people using them and the lack of education I think. THC was my worst addiction I personally ever had and now I just do opioids and they&#39;re (for me, key word for me) less addictive and just as helpful for my CPTSD.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a hilarious world out there and you shouldn&#39;t be against drugs for this, be against the people that let this happen and be against the people who pushed weed legalization that don&#39;t contribute to safe use and for the states that legalize THC that don&#39;t warn of addiction on the carts or bud.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve repeated this but I think it&#39;s a problem Everyone likes to consider weed over alcohol when both are drugs and both aren&#39;t good for you. Weed wears you down over time silently and alcohol has potential to make you do something really stupid if you drink too much. Both are bad in their unique ways. One is far more sinister.</p>

Do you have an alternative for public education? Private educations cost money, have shady teachers and private agendas. Kids choosing to abuse drugs and avoiding their education are old enough to know what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s a damn shame that&#39;s going to torment them as they age but whatever man, natural selection. You can&#39;t force the children to be educated. That&#39;s why you have tests and stress from homework and the scary threat of failing and repeating. I don&#39;t care if children are vaping, they&#39;re smart enough to do it.... Hmmm maybe we should impose financial penalties on underage smokers to set them back even further in life make them more desperate and get a criminal record flowing.</p>

<p>I do think vapes suck compared to the real thing.  What makes me ‘sad’ actually is how people kinda make more outta weed than it is (in my perspective) like tons of people I know are scared of it cause it makes them self conscious and paranoid when if they just approached it a little more casually and with a little more intention it might not be so disruptive and could be useful. As far as kids doing drugs they’re probably far better off fucking around with some weed than getting into prescription drugs or alcohol.</p>

<p>I think what makes weed special is that it comes in a smaller form like if I wanted to give someone alcohol to last a week I probably have to fill up a third if my trunk, but if I was doing the same for weed I would just have to give him a Ziploc bag (of varying sizes ofc)</p>

<p>and since it&#39;s illegal there is a network of people (drug dealers) that consists of not only dealers but individual users as well that can spread it. I mean technically if you buy from a drug dealer and then you share it with some friends you kind of are drug dealer yourself, technically.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a problem that people always see weed as something replacing something when ideally we wouldn&#39;t want any drugs at all. </p>

<p>I think if you consumed alcohol in a normal way that it would be better to have more alcohol than if more people consumed weed in a normal way if that makes sense. </p>

<p>Weed wears you down mentally over time verses with alcohol you have to potential to do something crazy by drinking too much. Both are bad just in different ways, and ideally less drugs is best. </p>

<p>I have had friends that are alcoholics and that is only a problem though the thing with them in my case was that they did weed and other drugs, so the decision making was really bad to begin with</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would r/trees be better? Especially when that place (and a few people in this thread even) calls r/leaves melodramatic and fake? </p>

<p>The reason I asked in this subreddit was because I felt like other people would share the same feeling as we are biased towards science and being better. The average person is a lot different than the average person on this subreddit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also a problem when this gets recommended and you have people that have algorithms on their Reddit to show them all weed related content, and then they come here, so it&#39;s not just this subreddit that is participating. On the plus side though, we&#39;ve gained 400 members since my post and we&#39;ve moved from #21 to #17 in the science category of reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i grew up in a country where its completely illegal and taboo. some people are born with the need for cannabinoid medication, esp. if their innate mode of information processing is fundamentally broken and maladaptive. i&#39;ve been able to move to america and my life is finally beginning to feel great, but i can&#39;t tell you how many years of my life were wasted because of the inaccessibility of cannabis.</p>

<p>tldr: freedom is better than prohibition. if people ruin their lives with weed thats their choice, they had agency in that. its much better than feeling like you have no agency to do anything with your life because the medicine you need is highly illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think with the way you phrase it, it&#39;s just that most people didn&#39;t get the help for whatever condition they had. They probably would be better off trying out and finding what the ideal adhd or depressing drug was for them. </p>

<p>I mean you yourself don&#39;t necessarily know if cannabis is the best choice for your life, maybe if he had seen a doctor and done different things you&#39;d be a more effective person, or maybe if you found the right nootropics or lifestyle it would have been good for you. </p>

<p>But you only live one life and you can only see things in one way in hindsight so that&#39;s that&#39;s. I think it&#39;s a problem when people see weed as some sort of catch all solution when in reality there are far better options for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope lol. It&#39;s so much sadder to see teens slip into drinking, yet that&#39;s been going on forever. If way rather it be weed. Society is told it&#39;s totally normally to steel a beer here it there at like 17 from your parents fridge , and then it&#39;s normal to get drunk as fuck the whole time in college even though your under age, and the while culture at college revolves around being the drunkest you can, and then it&#39;s normal to graduate and still drink all the time because your only 23, and before you know it your 49 or something still either low key drinking too much wine, or being a straight up alcoholic. It ruines lives and the lives of people around them, including innocent people (drunk drivers), it makes you aggressive , it makes you dangerously ill, you can even die if you quit it cold turkey unlike anything else even heroin(exept benzos). If you want to crap on a legal substance that society over uses...it should be alcohol. Alcohol is bullshit, it&#39;s a trap that they told you into before your even 21. It&#39;s a disgusting culture. Weed rules</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a problem that people always see weed as something replacing something when ideally we wouldn&#39;t want any drugs at all. </p>

<p>I think if you consumed alcohol in a normal way that it would be better to have more alcohol than if more people consumed weed in a normal way if that makes sense. </p>

<p>Weed wears you down mentally over time verses with alcohol you have to potential to do something crazy by drinking too much. Both are bad just in different ways, and ideally less drugs is best</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just wearing you down mentally it&#39;s the warping of your perception of the standards in your life and what you want to do in life. Why do anything else when you can just blaze it? You&#39;re just going to settle for a minimum and numb yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your wrong straight up. If you lack motivation as a person already then ANY substance use would potentially make that worse. If you had easiest access to alcohol then it would be alcohol, nothing inheranttly makes you lazy about cannabis, and just because the people in your own life couldn&#39;t handle being a success and using cannabis only proves their personal immaturity , and has nothing to do with the rest of us. Im 31, I&#39;ve smoked like 10 times a day since age 16. was at my boxing gym at 4:30 this morning before work, then I went to my job with one of the biggest life insurance companies in the country, and now on my lunch break in an hour I&#39;ll be going on 2 estimates for my second job (contractor). After work I&#39;m not going to eat McDonald&#39;s or some &quot;stoner food&quot; I&#39;m going to make a well balances , damn near chef quality meal like I do every night, and then be in bed (sleeping like a baby because if cannabis) by 930 pm so I can do it again tommorow. My best friend at the moment is a senior marketing executive making more than me or you combined and smokes more weed than I do. Again, just because your circle that you look at can&#39;t do it, doesn&#39;t mean a large portion of the rest of the population doesn&#39;t</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you do? There&#39;s probably more posts about tobacco and alcohol than about weed if I&#39;m going to be honest at least on Reddit. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s more of a campaign against alcohol and tobacco than there is against weed honestly. Think about ads and movements you do. </p>

<p>And people are really foolish for comparing alcohol and weed because they&#39;re both drugs and they&#39;re both something you shouldn&#39;t be doing really. Saying one is better than another doesn&#39;t justify making that better one more accessible in society. They&#39;re still damaging and unhealthy for society overall. One does it slowly and silently, the other starts slow but has potential to turn into something worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what people seem to neglect about weed is that it wears you down cognitively in many ways to a point where you don&#39;t know what you lost, </p>

<p>Versus with alcohol it&#39;s very easy to see how drinking too much in one night may have led you to rape someone or get into an accident or do something really stupid. </p>

<p>One is obvious, the other is not so much, and it&#39;s sinister in that way. </p>

<p>My main point though is that it&#39;s ideal to not have more drugs in society like what&#39;s happening now. Less alc or less weed are both good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. I don’t think kids nowadays can understand how different they have it with all this super weed around. I smoked my teens away and I wish I could just place my current perspective into the minds of the youth so that they can understand just how strong weed is now and also understand just how much it can hold you back. I been there done that, so while I understand teens are gonna smoke weed no matter what, I wish I could let them all know that as a big teenage stoner I wish I could go back and do it all over completely different. </p>

<p>That being said I’m glad kids aren’t going to jail for it now. I had a half dozen friends as a teen who had their lives completely screwed forever just bc they got busted with a little plant matter. </p>

<p>So on one hand I agree completely with you. But mostly I’m glad that we’re slowly growing out of the days when kids were locked up and had their whole lives ruined just bc they were going through a stoner phase. And I think that’s more important in my opinion. But damn I do wish weed wasn’t so damn strong nowadays. Kids are tripping out from one hit of this stuff. That’s not good to be smoking this new stuff every day all day.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, I also think a little mushrooms once a year would benefit the entire world unless there’s underlying schizophrenia or other various mental disorders that don’t respond well to that. But if society were to have some sort of screening process, I think a little bit of mushrooms at age 16 and 18 could really benefit the entire population born after that process is created. 😂 </p>

<p>So as you can probably see idk if my perspectives and opinions should be the one that everyone else agrees on and runs the world lolol. But it a smaller community maybe that would actually be beneficial. Sometimes I think the whole world would be so much better if there were 1 million different smaller communities than having a few large and generic communities. Maybe 🤔</p>

<p>I’ve had drs (PCPs, psychiatrists, pulmonologist in CA as well as TX), seemingly serious people, tell me that THC is completely acceptable for me to aid in sleep and is less addictive than some of the medications I was on. </p>

<p>But to be fair if you tried everything then I don&#39;t know if anything else can help. Maybe one day they&#39;ll make some sort of cannabinoid or something that specifically helps with sleep and doesn&#39;t cause any anxiety in the background. </p>

<p>Because I&#39;m certain there&#39;s some sort of solution out there that will help you sleep, be it from a doctor or not, but that&#39;s something we all have to do.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Trust me, I was extremely skeptical and nervous to use THC to help with sleep but I think it’s helped me alot. I’m def not a fan of anyone using weed day in and day out like the typical “stoners” that we see on tv. If I could find something else that is natural (that I haven’t already tried), didnt give me any anxiety and it worked, I would be so incredibly grateful and would switch to that immediately. </p>

<p>Thank you 😊</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kids shouldn&#39;t be doing it.  The brain isn&#39;t fully developed until like 25.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll one day realize the kids you know doing it have a lot of other problems in their lives, and they are just trying to find an outlet.  And, quite frankly, weed helps you have a good time, forget about your problems, and is distracting.  </p>

<p>As someone in their late 30s, I can tell you I know a lot more people now who are responsible and smoke weed on a regular basis.  It&#39;s a different situation as an adult.  You wake up, drink coffee, go to work, take care of some errands after work, then light up at the end of the day. </p>

<p>There&#39;s people who smoke weed and then there are people that are stupid and smoke weed.  The weed emphasizes how dumb the dumb people already are.  They make a personality out of it, and there&#39;s this whole dumb culture surrounding it.  Responsible adults just want to relax and cut loose a little bit with a couple hits and then go to sleep, and it doesnt get in the way of the rest of their lives.  And they don&#39;t talk about it all the time. It&#39;s not the main activity. </p>

<p>So, light up and relax.  I&#39;m just kidding.  Don&#39;t do it because you have other stuff to focus on now.  But, once you&#39;re like 25 or so and have figured out some stuff, give it a shot then.  Or don&#39;t, really.  If you have no idea what it&#39;s like, you&#39;re none the wiser, and no sense in starting a new, arguably bad habit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are trade-offs to everything. I think continuing to keep it illegal will not only fail to protect people from making these decisions but will also jeopardize their health further because black-market products aren&#39;t regulated and potentially unsafe. It&#39;ll also bring about greater social harm as more people find themselves involved in the legal system. So for those reasons, I feel the benefits outweigh the costs. It&#39;s worth discussing the very real harm of abusing cannabis, especially at a still-developing age. It shouldn&#39;t be taken as lightly as we often do simply because the harm isn&#39;t as visible and dire as say the thousands of opioid overdoses.<br/>
It should concern us more that teenagers are abusing cannabis and you are right to be concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the costs of even considering making it legal and normalizing it like we are doing now is far worse than some people being harmed from Black Market stuff. I mean the black market argument is kind of silly, because they are taking a risk and doing something they probably shouldn&#39;t be doing, especially if they&#39;re not smart enough to know their sources. </p>

<p>I would say anything that normalizes more drug use in society especially want to impacts the attitudes and use of the youth is bad. </p>

<p>But I mean it&#39;s not worth arguing because we&#39;ve already failed culturally. All the bad things are taking over and they fuel themselves, be it capitalism or technology or social media, whatever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making assumptions about people I&#39;m just saying that they probably would be better off without any sort of drugs at all. Is that a crazy assumption to make nowadays?</p>

<p>And my main point with everything is that I want less drugs. The only reason you do it is because drugs have ruined your life through your family and you only consumed weed because you were already so messed up. Do you think more drugs and Society is going to create more functional families or not? Never mind the economic pressure is the loneliness The Divide caused by social media and Technology, the fear...</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t have a lot of confidence in that Mom. She has cptsd and probably some other things and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to help her at all. And I have a feeling she&#39;s also projecting and his little biased because she applauded someone here that was being straight disrespectful and added nothing. I don&#39;t really think that person is interested in having a good conversation about this to be honest. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why it matters she&#39;s a mom, any mom can be bad and they could be ruining their lives of their children just like how your family hurt you. Like yeah it&#39;s hard being kids and I respect that but we&#39;re still all people and these drugs and things that we do to ourselves might actually be making things harder than we think. Only time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think you’ve lived enough life to have an opinion at this point. You are just asking to trigger people for real. Like what is so different about the folks who have a glass of wine at night compared to the folks who smoke a bowl of weed at night? Chemical relief is a very real thing and it has existed for hundreds of thousands of years. It’s not about escaping reality or an altered reality it’s simply some people like to have a buzz while others don’t. From the sound of it you are an opinionated likely keyboard warrior trying to speak lowly of an American soldier who also happens to be a mom. Shame on you. Stay off the internet you are ruining the tiny bit of good that most of us have left. Now when they legalize meth I’ll have a problem … o wait it is legal!!! It’s called Desoxyn. It’s methamphetamine hydrochloride. Prescribed by real doctors to real people for whom lower stimulants don’t work as well. So some people require weed to function so what dude. Climb down off your high horse and realize you even you in all your righteousness may require an opiate pain killer one day for an injury. Then the FDA freaks out and takes away the one thing that cured your pain. So you try weed and realize that not every consumer is just melting into their couch while chugging Mountain Dew eating Doritos. There are people who use way too much I see people like that all the time but then again I have the life experience to know that maybe that guy or that girl was raped for years on end and maybe that weed they can now legally buy is the only thing that helps them escape that torturous memory.

    <div class="md"><p>Well you do realize that my original post was just me being sad and explaining why I was sad and most of the comments here are attacking the issue from a different angle than what I am talking about. </p>

<p>So really this is bound to fail, that&#39;s just how the internet is and how people are with their opinions and how they want to express their opinions. </p>

<p>And the same goes for that American mom veteran, you guys are talking about the issue but from a completely different angle in what the post is about. I did say in my post what I was focusing on, and I also did say that I felt they were better options out there that people need to discover. </p>

<p>All I get here are some people forcing their opinion on me that what they do is best and that they don&#39;t think or care that there is a better possibility or ideal out there. The fact that people are missing that point tells me a lot about how they approach this and how they interpret this. </p>

<p>Your meth example is also really bad, if you actually understood the difference is between those two things then I would respect you as an adult, but you dont... do you not understand the significance of the meth drug for ADHD being controlled and being only in a specific form and only certain people having access to it?? I mean that pretty much exposes your lack of thinking right there</p>

<p>And on the escaping reality versus Buzz part, I don&#39;t don&#39;t really get how that applies because I&#39;m talking about the negatives here regardless if you&#39;re doing it for a buzz or to escape reality it&#39;s still not good. People smoke cigarettes for a buzz is that a good thing though?</p>

<p>Sorry but for the reasons listed above I don&#39;t really have respect for either of you because you&#39;re not very smart people and it seems like this is going to be a drag and go in circles. </p>

<p>No disrespect but I feel like a lot of humans are foolish and it&#39;s the millions that think like you that are relating to the situation we are in today in society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got into weed in Vietnam gotta say I loved it. When I came back to my I had 10 packs of parklanes,these were 20 marijuana cigarettes with filters, so I&#39;d go to the bars I hung at and open a pack fire one up they were stupid with weed then. I waited patiently till someone grabbed a cigarette sure babe try a park lane so they&#39;d light up and u know how the weed explodes a little when u first light on it they&#39;d see that but they were drunk so one fuck said what kind of cigarettes r these I said there German he kept smoking them I didn&#39;t see him anymore. Then this old WW2 fuck I started drinking with him sure enough he asked for a butt out came a park lane I was smoking one too the bartender was suspicious of the smell but I said they were German he went down the bar but gave me a weird look me and the WW2 guy were smoking and drinking r beers when some guy said some stuff to him and he exploded laughing which seemed to go on forever I was laughing too then after awhile he went.into a coma said nothing I left the bartender was freaking me and I went to another bar</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely nothing new about weed in school.
Weed has always been easy to get, conceal and smoke. Real easy. I sold a ton of it back then. Made a small fortune selling  dimebags  to pretty much every clique in school.
We used to get it if off of friends older siblings, a few parents, couple dealers. We could get pot real easy. Beer was hard. People didn&#39;t mind selling us pot but booze was harder to convince them.
One time we stole 5lbs out of a kids dad&#39;s shed. Put us in the weed business for a long time.</p>

<p>We used to sniff that rush or locker room in class too.</p>

<p>Ether sometimes, we would spray it on our shirt sit in the back of class and sniff it, but that gives you a headache.</p>

<p>Well actually from the sounds of it maybe we were bad kids. But it&#39;s always been there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been smoking since I was 13, I am 20 now. While it definitely has side effects and isn’t “harmless” (no substance is) I don’t feel it’s really gotten in the way of me being productive. I smoke before I do my daily exercise and work. It doesn’t make me tired at all. If I feel it’s not working or I want a break I’ll take a few weeks off. I know not everyone can control their use and be productive while using daily but a large portion of people can. What’s really sad is seeing someone generalize a plant with many different compounds in it with a variety of effects and using out dates stereo types to show one side of it. Most the people in this post literally say they’ve never tried it 😂. I even saw someone mention Alex Brendon’s “tell your children” which has been proven as pseudoscience in several journals…</p>

<p>I mean the main thing for me is the fact that it&#39;s being spread around more that more people especially younger people are going to get into it and it&#39;s not going to be good for them unlike people like you which may have good genetics for it.

    <div class="md"><p>Fact: the most widespread, accessible (hello young people), inhibit removing, addictive, destructive and HIGHLY sociological normalized, even encouraged drug on the planet… has to be alcohol. </p>

<p>Go ask your neighborhood police officer what over 75% of their calls usually involve. Clue: it ain’t the weed.</p>

<p>But cannabis isn’t harm free either. Although not as horrific, it can be abused and should not be consumed in excess by anyone.</p>

<p>However, you’re a fool to ignore the many legitimate, medical benefits. And that’s despite the fact that the plant is barely understood in terms of its full potential. Especially when you drill down into the spectrum and infinite possible ways to medically combine cannabinoids and terpenes. </p>

<p>Its literally natures miracle plant, and big pharma know it, which is why they are MASSIVELY to blame the decades long campaign to stigmatize and demonize it.
I’m sure you can decipher why the egregious pharmaceutical industry wouldn’t like a natural plant that you can grow on your porch in the sunshine and alleviate a great number of your ailments, with essentially zero side effects besides some extra munchies on occasion. But even that is a magic, haha… it’s saved many cancer patients who can’t eat because lack of appetite!</p>

<p>I applaud your intention here, and agree the ease of access should be better addressed for MANY substances, but if you really want to pick a boogie man “drug” eroding society from all sides because of its normalization, ease of access and destructive potential it can have on young people, or ALL people for that matter… then I gotta say, you’re aiming at the entirely wrong vice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I mean today there are non-stimulant ADHD medication so it&#39;s a lot better, but yeah stims are a lot risker. And also there&#39;s so many different kinds of them even stimulant ones, they can be dosed lower, be varying lenghts of extended release, either be an amphetamine or Methylphenidate, or be a non-stimulant like an NRI, DRI or something like guanfacine</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t take that fear too much. Just kind of unrelated but my dad knew I had ADHD when I was a kid but he never put me on anything out of fear, but he never ever told me until I stuggled for three years in high school then college, and then when I tell him I got diagnosed with it he&#39;s like oh yeah you had it. Like wtf you never told me?? </p>

<p>He could have at least followed how I was doing and been up to date with ADHD medicine for kids but he didnt. It sucks and I feel a little better now on a non stimulant med. But he was always negligent through my life so whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see it spreading in society. I also see young people changing their attitudes around alcohol. We&#39;re changing from a binge-drinking culture to a socially-drinking culture, and that is a good thing. Part of that healthy and long overdue change is offering alternatives that are less physically dangerous and less harmful to society like cannabis. The last time it was tried by the beatniks, alcohol companies lobbied to make cannabis illegal and succeeded. </p>

<p>Now, finally, young people are once again turning away from the binge-drinking culture that rotted the brains of previous generations and turning to safer healthier alternatives. This might cause some pearl-clutching by people who like looking down on those who smoke. These tend to be people who see stoners as &#39;that kind of culture and mindset.&quot;</p>

<p>The people who started most of the most profitable companies smoke cannabis. Lawyers and doctors smoke cannabis. Politicians and priests and policemen smoke cannabis. Republicans and democrats smoke it, young and old, rich and poor. Your average american cannabis user simply looks like your average American. His culture is that of the area in which he was raised. His mindset is one entirely resulting from the society in which he grew up. Cannabis does not cause laziness any more than alcohol does. </p>

<p>Cannabis or alcohol cannot take a man with will and purpose and make him listless and purposeless. That we see so many people down on their luck who consume in excess these substances is a symptom of some sort of inherent lack within the people overconsuming them. It is not a symptom of the consumption. A cannabis user can be as industrious and over-achieving as Elon Musk or he can be as underachieving as that guy you knew who never left his mother&#39;s basement. Taking cannabis away from the guy in his mom&#39;s basement won&#39;t make him into a functional member  of society, in fact, it&#39;s likely to take away the only solace he had from his lonely, dark, and disordered existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Copied reply since similar response)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a problem that people always see weed as something replacing something when ideally we wouldn&#39;t want any drugs at all. </p>

<p>I think if you consumed alcohol in a normal way that it would be better to have more alcohol than if more people consumed weed in a normal way if that makes sense. </p>

<p>Weed wears you down mentally over time verses with alcohol you have to potential to do something crazy by drinking too much. Both are bad just in different ways, and ideally less drugs is best. It doesn&#39;t really matter if alcohol doesn&#39;t have medicinal use because weed is used for pain and most people that don&#39;t have pain aren&#39;t using it for pain, they&#39;re using it to get high. And I think a lot of academic research would disagree with you on the front that it&#39;s not addictive, a lot of people certainly get dependent on it and they lose a lot in their lives because they let it numb them and make them complacent. r/leaves shows that ( and studies related to life outcomes and cognitive performance)</p>

<p>And also statistics don&#39;t say weed is replacing alcohol, yes there is less alcohol in our generation but there&#39;s also more nicotine and weed overall that contributes to a higher amount of drug use which is not surprising considering how bad off our generation is with loneliness and mental health and technology and all of that. My point is that we&#39;re just normalizing more drugs in society, and that&#39;s not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed is less harmful then alcohol in almost every way. Maybe only in the case of someone who has asthma, yeah they shouldn’t smoke. But alcohol has <em>so</em> many health risks; I mean it’s straight up poison.</p>

<p>Weed is a plant, sure a drug, but I’ll bring up the other accepted drug; caffeine. There’s many ways you can consume cannabis, which are not harmful—edibles!</p>

<p>Haven’t experienced the effect of weed wearing me down, despite smoking it nightly for the past 12 years, so I think that sounds more subjective. Plus, alcohol wears you out internally. It’s the silent killer for a reason. You drink and don’t know your liver is destroyed until you get scanned and find cancer. </p>

<p>I think humans will always consume drugs. </p>

<p>I mean, why are they innately bad? Is the act of expanding consciousness/different state of mind so bad? How come? Because of the very act of it or because of the possible consequences of the human in that state? What would you say if I told you a certain drug stopped me from committing suicide after I wrote my suicide note? You really want to end the use of these powerful drugs who have potential to save lives? How hard have you thought about this? Do you have any experience?</p>

I have way more aspirations and less anxiety about starting it when I smoke some weed. </p>

<p>Attention: weed affects people differently. Don’t base your decisions on MY experience!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re hyper concerned about cannabis.&quot;Ends up hurting them&quot;.
I&#39;ve seen alcohol cause automobile deaths,abuse,assaults,and other tragedies. I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve heard anything about weed doing anything close to that. People who abuse cannabis are weak and would find something else if it wasn&#39;t available. It&#39;s the lesser of two evils. Of course cannabis isn&#39;t &quot;trouble free&quot;.
Name one thing that is &quot;harmless&quot;.
You can&#39;t blame cannabis because of idiots. Idiots are the problem,and I think I know the kind you&#39;re talking about so I kind of understand why you&#39;re taking this stance. They don&#39;t represent an entire group. You just notice them more</p>

<p>I used to fuck around with Xanax and that isn&#39;t the way dude, none of that pharm shit is imo</p>

<p>now onto psychedelics, first time I tried a psychedelic I was 23. they were surely fun and I used them for introspective purposes but I definitely don&#39;t want to include them in a daily thing. at least I think lol. some days are just tougher then others for some people. as long as someone doesn&#39;t let it control them, I&#39;d say theyre okay (with any reasonably safe drug) </p>

<p>fuck heroin, benzos, and any of that type of shit, and fuck people that are out for a buck too with any drug (unless you&#39;re cool as fuck and give good deals on marijuana because youre not a schevy person, people like that do exist. I grew for 5 years and sold a couple ounces for 40$ each. can&#39;t get better then that lol. if anything the people paid for my slim jim habit lol) never was a seller but if I knew someone that needed a deal I&#39;d hook em up</p>

OOOOH AHHH!!! People like you make up your own stories and ideas about others when you wouldn&#39;t last a day in their world without getting thrown in the looney bin! </p>

<p>COUNT YOUR LUCKY MF STARS YOU DONT HAVE THE TRAUMA OTHERS DO FROM LIFE BEING CRAP DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN ITS JUST THAT WAY FOR MANY PEOPLE! MONEY AND HOUSES AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT JUST PASSED DOWN OR HANDED TO EVERYONE SOME PEOPLE GOTTA START AT THE BOTTOM AND IF USING A HEALTHY NATURAL CURE FOR ANXIETY INSTEAD OF POPPING PRESCRIPTION CANCER CAUSING PILLS FOR IT IS WHAT THEY CHOOSE THEN YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR CHOICE FOR SIMPLY USING WEED AND NOT USING HARD DRUGS OR BECOMING A MURDERER BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN AND WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN.</p>

<p>YOU MAKE ME SICK IN ALL HONESTY. GO TAKE A HIKE BACK TO INEXPERIENCED, IGNORANT SNOB HILL AND LEAVE US REAL ONES ALONE ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR WEED.</p>

<p>🤬🤬🤬</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should get into nootropics, that&#39;s what this subreddit is about. You can be motivated and calm without weed. And if you think any of my comments were judgmental you&#39;re clearly not reading them right.

<p>My point is that most people don&#39;t derive benefits for it, especially younger people. You may not be most people. It is a real issue that hurts people and the fact that some people overreact because they think they&#39;re being attacked and becoming over sensitive and defensive about it like you are says a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>There is no “proper use” of THC.  If you disagree, feel free to refute the central points of my claim in this thread.</h1>

<p>The youth enjoy it because, <a href="https://youtu.be/rn6roeUfMio?si=XhNG1ZkTikfqkG-q&amp;t=8m5s">like it or not, THC is a value-changing drug…It changes your values.</a> The new mental perspective allows the youth to see that something they were often told is dangerous, truly is not a danger. This fact, coupled with increased communication between unrelated brain systems, results in a mental state that is primed to question the status quo. </p>

<p>The youth are always at the precipice of increasingly progressive values and ideas about how society should be operated. THC and certain other substances are accelerating that, which is good if you value societal progression over preservation of tradition. </p>

<p>Also, THC is NOT a nootropic, where the intended use case is minimal psychoactive effect and maximum “productive” output. <strong>No one is “giving in” to anything, they are selectively exploring altered states of consciousness, even if they do not fully understand what they are doing.</strong> </p>

<p>The overall results of long term cannabis (and especially 5HT2A agonists) use seem to be open-mindedness, increased empathy, short term ego-dissolution, and a compassionate attitude. Sounds like a profound way to view the world, compared with only valuing productive output or logical intellect. </p>

<p>OP, you should give it a try! Once per day for a calendar month and each night make some notations about how you notice perceptual changes and if you begin to question any sincerely held beliefs. This experiment is guaranteed to strengthen your conscious awareness and provide development of your values, wether you enjoy every single experience or not.</p>

<p>Which claims have I made where studies provide results that say otherwise? Please get specific. </p>

<p>It totally makes sense that lots of former heavy users feel better upon stopping. Consuming ANYTHING heavily without intention or balance will yield negative results for that person. </p>

<p>You seem to be jumping the gun and imparting a narrative upon a large set of young people who are experimenting with altered states of consciousness. You seem to believe that exploration of the substance necessarily leads to chronic use or dependence. I disagree and think maybe you should experiment yourself, in the name of self-growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if there are more people using there are certainly more people that are engaging in chronic use and especially when you have online communities and algorithms that guide these people to believe that it can be done every day it&#39;s even more concerning. Most people just want to be high and they want to be high a lot and they&#39;re not going to have balance in their lives because they don&#39;t know how to manage their lives especially at a younger age or really any age for that matter. </p>

<p>It won&#39;t be a good thing for society as a whole the more drugs we have especially with mental health and technology being so bad for younger people and just the bleakness and poor economic outlook of everything for them.</p>

<p>r/leaves also has lots of people, you have to remember that a lot of the people that had negative effects aren&#39;t going to be talking about it especially on apps online. They&#39;re going to just be living their lives maybe with no free time or expiration for that kind of thing, and most of them are living with a lot of regret. A lot of activity online and on the Internet is some sort of self-selection, that&#39;s science.</p>

<p>Also young people use it way more (according to data) and they&#39;re consuming more potent stuff than most adults ever did.</p>

If you yourself give it a try I promise... I PROMISE YOU you will realize it&#39;s not the demon they make it out to be. Sincerely, someone who came from a deeply religious upbringing- who drank the coolaid of propaganda- but actually gave it a try when I was 31 and realized the truth and did research and independent thinking.

<p>Not typing it all up again, but you have to see past your own experiences and try and see what is going on as a whole. If cannabis is compatible with you to where you don&#39;t end up with negative effects on your life or end up in places like r/leaves or r/weedpaws, that at that point it may as well not be not be the cannabis people stigmatize. You aren&#39;t everyone. Yes I would agree that in terms of anxiolytics other countries do have better alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed is a much better choice than alcohol, opiates, or basically anything else. From a liberty standpoint people should have the right to indulge in what they wish, at least the plant medicines. (Cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca etc.)</p>

<p>Also weed was very illegal when I was in high school and vapes weren’t a thing yet and we still smoked plenty. Even did cocaine, adderall, synthetic psychedelics such as 25-I Nbome which is very dangerous. Kids will always do substances, education is the most important step. Now that fentanyl is in everything, knowing how to properly test your drugs should be common knowledge and those in the know should educate those around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been smoking weed for 25 years since I was 16.  I fronted 3 different bands including punk rockabilly and digital devo group, had a successful crowd funded cottage manufacturing Kickstarter producing 3 different board games by hand, currently run a laser engraving bed and a 24 inch roll printer with two startups gaining business and success.  I have an accounting degree and use API to make my job easier so I can be stoned at work while playing Nintendo Switch making 6+figs.  My house has a secret sewing room that I put a picture window in and use as a writing room and am almost done with a 3k page science fiction novel.  I am working on restoring a 47 Chevrolet Stylmeaster and at the age of 42 I still go to the skate park and drop in the bowl and pull Tony Hawk tricks out of my ass.  My life is more interesting than yours.  I know this because I am the most interesting pothead in the world.  Either way, splash half a grape chewable tablet of sarcosine each morning and your brain is completely protected against any negative schizophrenic effects of Marijuana.  It isn&#39;t sad that kids smoke weed.  It&#39;s sad that weed isn&#39;t high quality all the time and sometimes kids end up smoking boof.  Cough*</p>

<p>Everyone will always say that there is some self-selection bias and that people with these traumas or struggles will turn the drugs which is true, but you could also say that the same people that turn to drugs still could have been way better without drugs.

<p>And that denial is a very powerful thing because these people don&#39;t realize what it&#39;s doing and wearing down their cognition and emotional regulation and just the functioning of their brain, which is why marijuana is such a Sinister thing, but but at least they&#39;re not going to beat someone up or crash a car if they drink too much alcohol, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely right about that my friend was an alcoholic for a short period of time and he tried to get one of my senior neighbors to keep buying but he realized that he shouldn&#39;t be buying for a minor and he stopped. </p>

<p>I think what makes weed special is that it comes in a smaller form like if I wanted to give someone alcohol to last a week I probably have to fill up a third if my trunk, but if I was doing the same for weed I would just have to give him a Ziploc bag (of varying sizes ofc)</p>

<p>and since it&#39;s illegal there is a network of people (drug dealers) that consists of not only dealers but individual users as well that can spread it. I mean technically if you buy from a drug dealer and then you share it with some friends you kind of are drug dealer yourself, technically.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a problem when this gets recommended and you have people that have algorithms on their Reddit to show them all weed related content, and then they come here, so it&#39;s not just this subreddit that is participating.

<p>Yet the people who have had their lives dulled and brains ruined aren&#39;t butting into conversations irl or online talking about it, unless of course they&#39;re trying to get help. r/leaves </p>

<p>And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the vast majority of people who did it saw negatives as studies suggest and based off what we know about it&#39;s mechanism of action. </p>

<p>But nooo focus on the celebrities or all the good cases to justify your use or some Reddit or boasting online how cool they are because they do something. It&#39;s only going to get worse, it&#39;s a perfect storm. Also realized these posts are being recommended to people who are into marijuana as well.
