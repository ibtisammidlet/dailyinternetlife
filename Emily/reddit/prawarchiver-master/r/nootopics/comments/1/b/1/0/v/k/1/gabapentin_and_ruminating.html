    <div class="md"><p>I work in a brain speciality clinic. This is not medical advice and I&#39;m not a licensed provider. I&#39;ve also been on Gabapentin so I can provide some insight. </p>

<p>Gabapentin can create neural stability. It does this by modulating calcium channel activity and by stabilizing neural activity it then reduces the excessive neuronal firing associated with anxiety and repetitive thought patterns associated with anxiety. </p>

<p>This can lead to a decrease in anxiety symptoms, including ruminating thoughts.</p>

<p>I work with neuro psychiatrists and psych nurse practitioners. They used to prescribe Gabapentin off label for anxiety, however (and this is a big however), they no longer prescribe it for anxiety because it can cause memory loss and brain fog. </p>

<p>I have a type of autoimmune arthritis that affects my tendons and when I get injured it can last for a very long time and become chronic. I had problems with my achilles not healing and I was put on massive doses of Gabapentin because of the pain. I was up to the highest dose possible and it really didn&#39;t do much for me once you get to a certain dosage. You can add as much as you want and it will make no difference. </p>

<p>The problem for me was it did exactly what my colleagues at the clinic talk about. It caused brain fog, lack of clarity, and forgetfulness. </p>

<p>I wish I would have never taken it. I do think that there are better substances out there that can help for rumination.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had rumination since a child, pretty bad, I went through a research program with Mass General (as a study participant), I&#39;ve also done some other treatments that have worked well but I would never go back to Gabapentin because of the memory loss concern. My colleague who owns a psych clinic has decided to have all of his therapists stop prescribing it. </p>

<p>It can also be difficult to get off of. 
I titrated down and had to do it very slowly and still had withdraw effects. One of the withdrawal effects can be increased anxiety and depression. So please proceed with caution. </p>

<p>Gabapentin can calm and quiet the nerve system. Anxiety is part of the nerve system. Hope that makes sense. </p>

<p>I&#39;d look into carnosic acid, DHH-B and a little device that has been miraculous for people with severe anxiety is called Pulsetto. I&#39;ve used a number of anti-anxiety devices and that one works the best. </p>

<p>When I talk to patients and they ask me for recommendations, I usually recommend Pulsetto and they end up raving about it. I got mine when they were on Indigogo. So it wasn&#39;t that expensive but the price has gone way up now. Get on their mailing list and wait for a major sale and they will likely have 50% to 60% off sometimes.</p>

<p>If you need more scientific info let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>300mg isn&#39;t too bad. I was on 1,500mg BID (2x a day). Just be careful with it. I&#39;d look at carnosic acid or DHH-B as an alternative. The mind chatter is awful. Redirecting is the best way to interrupt the repetitive neuronal patterns. If you are able to do that, you can actually control it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NAC 1200mg 2x a day splashed with 2-4g Glycine is god mode for rumination and impulses such as fingernail chewing, booger pickin, and nicotine usage in general.  No effect when ceasing.  Only negative is; once you use it for a while you need to cycle it or it may affect you passion for hobbies and esoteric endeavors as it controls impulse so well it can dampen creativity.  I use armodafinil but the DRI effect will make me waste the entire day unless I splash NAC.  The only reason I always include Glycine is ....  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35975308/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35975308/</a>  .  Also just for fun I&#39;ll mention that Grape Chewable Sarcosine tablets completely negate the schizophrenic deformation of Marijuana and from what I have experienced prevents memory issues as well.    (another easter egg of info: 600ish mg Modafinil can completely end an opioid addiction in one tweaked out dose without relapse by erasing the memory of them, im proof. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939923/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939923/</a> and as such I only take non-narcotic pain killers the rest of my life as from the moment Moda kicked in I cannot even remember my addiction.) &lt;3 Glutamate Channels. - A Guinea Pig</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because It diminishes calcium influx and hyperexcitability, problem with pregabalin/gabapentin is that It leads to paradoxical regulations , It upregulates the channels it works on, leading to bad withdrawals, It binds with high affinity to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels</p>

<p>i dont know If that happens with nimodipine an L type calcium channel antagonist, doesnt seem to bê the case as i saw no reports of withdrawal, even from people that were brain damaged by benzodiazepines, the latter in the case leads to the upregulation of L type voltage gated calcium channels, leading to calcium overload and nerve/brain damage</p>

<p>L-type channels are extensively distributed on central neurons [38, 39], and play significant roles in dendritic and somatic Ca2+ accumulation [40-42], gene expression [43], and excitability [44]. While regulated Ca2+ accumulation underlies much physiological signaling, un-regulated neuronal Ca2+ overload has long been established as a mechanism of neuronal injury. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a gaba-b receptor agonist (it binds to and activates the receptor). Gaba is the primary slow down and relax neurotransmitter. Benzos are also gaba agonists. So is phenibut.</p>

<p>But GABA agonists typically cause tolerance and withdrawal so regular use is not advised.</p>

<p>Edit: Apparently the above is entirely a lie but you will see it repeated on reddit. My bad and lesson learned.</p>

<p>negligible. phenibut has some affinity but gabapentin has almost zero. gaba-b is also very different from gaba-a;; gaba-b is a GPCR while GABA-A is a ligand-gated ion channel. they also have different effects. fun fact---your eyes express a lot of gabaB and it&#39;s very important for vision.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>benzos are gaba-a positive allosteric modulators, not agonists</p>

<p>true. same with gabapentinoids (which act primarily through their action on VGCCs).</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification... reddit posters repeated several times to me that it is a gaba agonist but a Google search shows you are correct.</p>

<p>This is a sign for me to be more skeptical of what strangers say on nootropic and related subreddits ughhh 😔</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol yeah you def need to confirm everything you read on Reddit.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting stuff to learn on here though, just gotta know that some people write so confidently we often assume they’re correct.</p>

<p>I see Reddit as a place to lead me down interesting rabbit holes.</p>

<p>Now go fact check everything I just said.</p>
