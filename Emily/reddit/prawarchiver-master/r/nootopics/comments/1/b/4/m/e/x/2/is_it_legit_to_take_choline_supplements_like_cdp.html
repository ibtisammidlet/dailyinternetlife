    <div class="md"><p>I would just eat a lot of eggs and take magnesium glycinate and l-theanine to keep your nervous system chill. Just stay away from modulating your ach directly. Exercise a lot. Eat healthy. Good fats, healthy protein &amp; avoid processed carbs. Don’t go for the fancy stuff it might just make you even more agitated - number one thing is to be able to relax while your body normalizes - which it will normalize. Keep it up homie! I had fun with nicotine but getting off of it was one of the best choices I ever made! The right thing to do ain’t always the easiest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply and the kind words.
What positive things do you noticed when you finally quit nicotine?
Because at the moment I can’t imagine to live without nic. It helped me with my mood and focus and overall well-being</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short after the withdrawal wore off I realized I had been in a constant state of agitation with the nicotine. I feel much more peaceful these days and my mood is more stable. As for focus it’s a similar thing at first without the stimulation it was more difficult but now I find I am able to sit down and work much longer without being constantly distracted by my next nicotine hit in the back of my mind. I think I actually was in a constant state of low level withdrawal when I was using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn that’s a bad nic wd. I recently quit vaping up to three pods of 50 mg so up to 300 mg a day cold turkey. And before I started I was really concerned it was gonna be bad. But mostly just strong cravings for a week. And then I got home from vacation and started again just because I personally don’t really see any reason to stay abstinent.
Sorry… that probably sounds like I’m just bragging.</p>

<p>If I were you I’d look into galantamine or consider a low dose patch.</p>

<p>I don’t have any studies to cite I’m sure there are some but I had planned on trying it if I were ever in your situation. There used to be a little talk about it on r/nootropics as well.</p>

<p>Here’s a segment of the wiki pharmacology section:</p>

<p>“Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) α4β2, α3β4, and α6β4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs α7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain.[4][32] By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine.[22] This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released.[33] However, recent studies suggest that Galantamine does not functionally act at human nAChRs α4β2 or α7 as a positive allosteric modulator.[34][35]</p>

<p>Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body.[4] By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine&#39;s effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s”</p>

<p>Based on that I always thought it’d be a solid remedy.
I’ve quit with patches before and it was a cakewalk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do.
In my experience they relieved craving but didn’t really produce anything noticeable. I personally would think of them as a safe minor relief without really back pedaling. But if your symptoms are that bad I’d try and remedy them in some way even if it sounds counter intuitive.
That’s just my experience and my opinion it could work out differently for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there are definitely reasons to quit nicotine.</p>

<p>It is an easy dopamine source that does not require work, health concerns over method of consumption like gum issue, nicotine raises blood pressure</p>

<p>I would say the patch is the best way to consume nicotine due to low speed of onset, and it will not detrimentally affect oral health</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I understand when people have those personal reasons. I can’t sit here and say that anyone who’s thinking about quitting should think twice. But I have no personal concerns about the negatives you just mentioned. 
Of all the vices in my life it’s really benign.</p>

<p>But yeah that’s just me if anyone wants to stop nicotine I’m all for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of Vices nicotine is not bad at all compared to others. Mainly its the blood pressure increase that cannot be avoided which isnt optimal for longevity. Also cost of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah my bp is in healthy range and I ironically start to vape a little more more before a doctors appointment I get pretty anxious. But I honestly only feel nicotine bin the morning or if I forget my vape somewhere. And what I crave the most is the flavor obviously associated with minor dopamine release. That’s the thing about vaping is consistent low doses of nicotine all day opposed to say smoking a rapid high dose with hours in between.</p>

<p>It is pretty remarkable the method in which nicotine addicts people. My first experiences were second to dxm in terms of dysphoria, and any euphoria that I experience is really a feeling of relief more than any actual euphoria. Opposed to true euphorias from alcohol to any other recreational drug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it could certainly work. Part of how bupropion works is not only by blocking some of the NAchRs but also partially activating one or two. The modulating effect initially has a cognitive fogging effect that normalizes and actually becomes somewhat pro-cognitive after a desensitization period.</p>

<p>If you wanted to supplement acetylcholine levels, I&#39;d say alpha-GPC. Citicoline (CDP-choline) can increase Phosphatidylcholine levels as well, but that&#39;s not the goal here, and alpha-GPC is gonna be cheaper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three weeks and you’ve broken the habit physically. After that it’s just your mind playing tricks. Nicotine up regulates choline and dopamine transmission. Research safe cholinergics and verify with Reddit experience stories and pub med, CDP choline is the preferred route, add something that upregulates dopamine; for example a natural MAOI like rhodiola crenulata(stimulant properties needs to be cycled 8-12 weeks).</p>
