    <div class="md"><p>wow , I order from Florida so it&#39;s goes from coast to coast, within the state and at tops it takes a week to get to me. </p>

<p>Did u have any preorders in it? If there&#39;s a pre-order in the order then you have to wait for that specific item to become available for everything to ship</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ordered to Europe. It was shipped. As I said, last tracking update was 3rd of February in NY. In my previous experience after NY it takes max 2 Weeks to get my shipping from NY to my address in EU. I will wait some more since there is nothing I can do, but next time I will rather look for similar products in Europe, even if I have to pay more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I I checked tracing number on USPS website, 17track and my used my country local service. I did the same today and finally I see a new update after more than 4 Weeks since it arrived in Brussels. Which is not my country, so probably another 1 week of waiting till it gets to Slovenia. A Total shipping time will probably be about 6 to 7 Weeks. The most important now will be that I even get my order, but I am still disapointed about waiting for so long, because I saw some other reddit users writting that they usually get their order in 2-3 Weeks to Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With parcels from the US, I will usually only get anymore updates after it leaves the US when I input the international tracking number + my postal code at PostNL International track &#39;n trace (because they usually do the last mile delivery, if I just even use PostNL&#39;s normal site it returns a not found message). 
Tracking it with the American company always suddenly stops giving updates for me. Even if I get nothing at PostNL Int. I would always then try the other big players like UPC, DHL(NL), DHL(Germany) etc, because it all depends if the plane with your parcel landed in your own or a neighbouring country and which services operate there.</p>

<p>Using 17Track website/app is an easy way of only inputting the tracking number once and if automatic carrier selection fails, trying out selecting all the different carriers. App is great to get push updates on new tracking info.</p>

<p>Of course the companies I mentioned will be different if you&#39;re from another European country than NL, just apply the same principle. Do it quick! You don&#39;t want to find out it&#39;s been laying at a service point for 1 or 2 weeks and got returned to sender already... One time my neighbour had it for over 3 weeks :P</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a few times where the letter they&#39;re supposed to send me that it&#39;s brought to the closest service point (because I wasn&#39;t home on parcel delivery), never got delivered in my mail. Sometimes it&#39;s just a small note from the deliverer that falls under a shoe...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always received my parcels from EC in (not much more than) a week after last scan in US (about 5 orders). But maybe Netherlands is just a good location. Anyway always exceptional service and quality :)</p>

<hr/>

<p>(Only this time I found out I didn&#39;t get the &quot;order has been processed&quot;, but did get the initial &quot;order received&quot; mail on 18 feb. Stupid me should&#39;ve checked on it earlier. I just replied to the initial mail, hope all goods are still in stock... Probably an error in their software, either digital or human error)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you did not receive a single mail? Because the system immediately sends everyone an automated &quot;order has been received&quot; mail. You didn&#39;t get that? 
I suspect you put a typo in your email adress / in your Spam folder. What domain is your email provider? </p>

<p>Did you send your mail to: contact at EC? (shouldn&#39;t write the whole address here for multiple reasons) And when? Let me know, I might try to reach the owner through Discord if more people have some troubles. You can pm me your mail if you want to. When did you send your email?</p>

<p>I myself did receive the 1st mail but not the &quot;your order has been processed&quot; one this time, which I always got the same day. Have done 5 orders which always went perfect and fast, and this is the case as well for many many people I know about.</p>

<p>Anyway EC always acts honorably, but sometimes an order can get screwed up for various reasons of our own or their mistake. You will eventually get it sorted no worries.</p>
