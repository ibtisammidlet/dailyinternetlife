        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Update:</strong> Reddit overturned the ban, likely due to the effort from you all, but I&#39;m glad I was able to shine a light on what&#39;s happening behind the scenes. I made a response here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1b90qtc/my_permanent_ban_just_got_lifted_but_yeah_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1b90qtc/my_permanent_ban_just_got_lifted_but_yeah_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Original post:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp">https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp</a> </p>

<p>We have been growing rapidly and the r/Nootropics moderators and others are going to do all they can to stop what we are doing. Over the past couple years we&#39;ve dealt with a ridiculous amount of reports raiding, bot nets, and numerous unjust bans, so this is hardly new but it&#39;s a big deal to be sure.</p>

<p>The discord is also likely going to be under attack, as historically it has been, but now there won&#39;t be anything to fall back on (yet). We need a good amount of support to move to our own social media designed for us that will be called <a href="https://chatsci.com">chatsci.com</a>, message us on discord if you are interested! And PS I will not accept some janky half-assed forum board, it needs to be good, so it will be a huge undertaking. I don&#39;t care about making money off it, so don&#39;t expect ads or weird subscriptions.</p>

<p>Basically this has been a long and drawn out competition to defend the true nootropics, legacy of Corneliu, our niche subculture, and freedom to continue things as it has been. But now we really need to come together or I promise it will all be lost in due time.</p>

<p>Just to truly explain what I&#39;ve dealt with the past 2 years to try and keep things afloat:</p>

<p>- Frequent DDoS attempts</p>

<p>- Lost domain (due to njalla being awful)</p>

<p>- Lost 3 payment processors</p>

<p>- Lost 2 discord servers, almost lost the recent one</p>

<p>- Almost lost the subreddit, almost lost my discord account (recently)- Lost u/sirsadalot which was a well known account</p>

<p>And more. So much more. This is not paranoia, it&#39;s my reality. Everything I&#39;ve made is constantly being challenged. So if I can&#39;t own the social medias, like actually own them, then they will definitely be stolen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ND has so much power through owning r/nootropics for years and having at least a 100 company affiliated accounts and likely more through their network. Mass reporting and controlling the dialogue to some extent is a part of their ( successful ) business strategy, a business that will only make millions more. </p>

<p>The fact that they would try and pin Sirsad&#39;s last post about peptide production improvements when they have had no problem themselves selling substances that actually have addictive and harmful potential  <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-nh/pr/arizona-company-and-ceo-plead-guilty-distribution-drugs-not-approved-fda-and-will-pay-24">(read)</a> tells you everything you need to know. </p>

<p>I mean we let people on Reddit talk about drugs and encourage each other to do obviously illegal and harmful drugs, but then we have situations like these where there&#39;s clear interference involved. May as well ban every ND and vendor account on reddit that&#39;s ever talked about their production process and standards lol.</p>
