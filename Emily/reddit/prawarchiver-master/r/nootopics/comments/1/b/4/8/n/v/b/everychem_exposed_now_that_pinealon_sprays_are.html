        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello. The recall that happened a few months ago was really depressing, however limited the exposure may have been. I am not making excuses for it. I just want to prove that I am dead-set on preventing anything of that nature from occurring ever again. And I want to continue offering quality peptides.</p>

<p>First of all, Sodium Benzoate won&#39;t be used anymore; going forward, I&#39;ll be adding Benzyl Alcohol to all peptide products. The UVC sterilization chamber I spoke about previously has been built. This will help with avoiding any potential microbiota spore contamination from bottle suppliers, which is likely what happened with the square bottles.</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/xv0x7r3xsslc1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8aa07a1b0dbbc98b148770a9af2fc64c8a7214">(The purple isn&#39;t from the UVC - I&#39;d probably go blind if I turned that thing on out in the open)</a></p>

<p>I thought it over, and made some adjustments. Now whenever we&#39;re dealing with an open peptide solution, everyone needs to wear a mask instead of just gloves. And instead of just cleaning solution, it&#39;s cleaning solution and then pure ethanol when using the bottle filling machine. And I make my employees use hand sanitizer before putting on gloves.</p>

<p>The work and storage rooms have long since been shut off from the outside, and from the office. But I also installed a dedicated AC system, dehumidifier and air purifier for that space. Florida is a swampland, so I&#39;m aware that I have to be extra careful about this.</p>

<p>Peptide leaks kept happening last year, so I&#39;ve tested the Pinealon bottles in a vacuum chamber before listing them. None leaked. Fingers crossed. If a leak happens again, I swear the bottle manufacturer will see me outside their house at 2 AM (for all intents and purposes, this is a Minecraft reference).</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/nex1ycdlsslc1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=257831ff68a04ee4c5f2921796b0a800c8f4d305">Pinealon bottles in a vacuum chamber (none leaked)</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve explored the tamper seal machines, and aluminum induction. I own the machines, but more needs to be done before I can use them during production. Which is easier said than done, but I&#39;m getting closer to it.</p>

<p>Also wasn&#39;t happy with the quality of labels, so I&#39;ve been putting a lot of effort into perfecting that process. They&#39;re more chemical resistant now, but I&#39;m not quite there with them yet. </p>

<p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/1b48nvb/video/vrr9kosyoslc1/player">Finally using the label applicator after like a year of trying to get it to work</a></p>

<p>A lot of you have been incredibly patient and understanding with me during this all, and for that you have my utmost respect. If it weren&#39;t for the good people this community has to offer, I definitely would&#39;ve quit some time last year - the r/Nootropics moderators, their affiliated businesses, and whoever else are playing extra dirty, constantly trying to sabotage my projects through mass reports.</p>

<p>Anyways, just wanted to talk about the progress/ changes we&#39;ve made and give another big thanks to everyone who continues to show support, I&#39;ll prove that I deserve it in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U/sirsadalot, I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, huge respect to you for your honesty and effortS to produce outstanding products , notably your Nasal spray Bromantane, that I’ve order 6 times already from the UK, as well as NSI 189 and Semax ( old bottles). </p>

<p>I do ask Z** for customer loyalty discount, and hope you’ll introduce it soon.</p>

<p>Cheers from the UK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think everychem is shutting down, folks. So Reddit banned sirsad. That sucks, but Reddit has never been our primary mode of communication.</p>

<p>There is also an invite link under this subreddit&#39;s &quot;About&quot; information.</p>

<p>I know there was also talk of moving to Lemmy, Mastodon, or something similar. The trains are still running and on time, afaik.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With peptides sometimes intranasal can be really effective be because the olfactory nerves are able to take up peptides and transport them along the axons to the brain. I think this just differs wildly between every peptide. Insulin, Cere, Cortexin work great in my opinion and many people take it this way. Cere suddenly needs way less of a dosage intranasally, most people have enough with 0.2mL/day, some go much more wild, everyones body chemistry is different ofc so some might be less sensitive to Cere overall, or perhaps intranasal damage reduces uptake, though Cere would be great to repair any damage slowly and then might become more potent over time.</p>

<p>Pinealon no experience yet and haven&#39;t researched much, but I will always test IN first as it&#39;s just really practical and saves some time and effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.... I was on everychem last night looking over things I wanted to get and when I went on tonight it stated that I was banned or prohibited or something due to &quot;suspicious activity&quot;.  Im unsure of what that might be but was hoping to order some bromantane spray... I could go other places but you had a good price.  Perhaps this can be fixed?  Thank you for your time and attention.</p>
