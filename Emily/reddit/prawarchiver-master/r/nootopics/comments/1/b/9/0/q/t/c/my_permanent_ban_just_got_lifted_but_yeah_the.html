<p>Thanks to the pressure from you guys, the appeal quickly overturned the ban since literally nothing I&#39;ve ever posted has been a violation of ToS. But this just goes to show that if you&#39;re not already on our discord, you really need to join. Here&#39;s another link for that: <a href="https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp">https://discord.gg/89sGa8pBWp</a></p>

<p>And I definitely need to speed up the development of <a href="https://chatsci.com">chatsci.com</a>. So if you want to be a part of that, message me (not on reddit).</p>

<p>If I had to guess, r/Nootropics was probably behind this. Good reason to doubt it being anyone else, and goes hand in hand with their recent activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story but basically I used to contribute a lot to there and a lot of people knew me and then I wanted to work in the industry but as soon as I did they banned me and began trying to take down everything I made/ was making.</p>

<p>Their reason for doing so? Some bogus conspiracy that not even they believed about how the entire time I was secretly a salesman for some company I didn&#39;t own despite my posts being just science related. So I made NooTopics and held it to a higher standard, and people liked that</p>

<p>They have financial incentive to remove people like me who are competition to them because they are working for businesses like ND, so to this day I still hear about them trying to lower my reputation, and this time the subreddit started gaining a lot of new members and low and behold my account suddenly gets banned! This isn&#39;t ever going to stop by the looks of it and I don&#39;t have faith reddit will ever do anything about them especially because they brag about knowing reddit employees</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you link some post of them about that conspiracy that you were a salesman?</p>

<p>I would like to read both sides of the story. I&#39;ve always hold ND as a reliable company that want to do things right, especially in the nootropics/supplements industry.</p>

<p>Have you ever had any problem directly with misteryouaresodumb or did he contribute to the conspiracy that you were working for some company? Are you sure that if the admins of the nootropics subreddit have financial incentive to remove people like you, ND would be involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happened a long time ago so maybe someone else could provide a link but myasd was not on my side during the ban whatsoever and there&#39;s a metric ton of vendors in the supplement and RC industry that have personally been accused of things by him. Take MPMD for instance, he was the most recent one who despite having claimed COAs from other companies, myasd felt the need to use the lab that he literally owns (not even 3rd party) to create some rumor about gorilla mind selling 0.1% extracts on things. Back in the early days there was a lot of victims like teamtlr (which tbh I&#39;m not sure is true or false), absorb health, limitlesslifenootropics, some other vendors I forget the names of, etc. Anyways I&#39;ve talked to multiple vendors that have specifically talked about misteryouaresodumb doing shady business tactics to hurt competition, and the thing is you won&#39;t ever hear from 99% of them who just got blackballed instead of publicly shamed. Only reason you are seeing this now is because I had too many followers to just be quietly disposed of. </p>

<p>And I know for a fact I&#39;ve rubbed him the wrong way, if not then, then especially over time because I constantly shit-talk herbal supplements which is his entire business strategy, and I wasn&#39;t supportive of him selling phenibut &amp; tianeptine or the entire mod team being pro kratom due to my disdain for addictive drugs</p>

<p>And regardless it&#39;s pretty clear that Majalisk is on the ND payroll and him and metacognition have been pretty blunt about how much they want me gone.</p>
