        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that folks in nootropics and other kinds of health communities seem to have a total disdain for marijuana, or, at best, an acceptance for the right to recreation through drugs while still considering marijuana to be orthogonal to any sort of cognitive enhancement goals.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And I do understand the perspective. The memory deficits induced by THC really do make it a hard sell as a cognitive enhancer. But what about the incredible enhancement of sensory clarity? The detail you hear in songs when you&#39;re high is real. The flavors you taste in food are real. The body language you notice when you&#39;re high is real. THC reveals so many more objects in your conscious experience that you can reason about. It&#39;s really so revealing how often the bottleneck of effective cognition is not a lack of ability to draw correct and interesting inferences but a lack of material to apply it to.</p>

<p>Many a stack and nootropic have as their goal to get the motivation and mental acceleration of stimulants without paying a steep price in tolerance and neurotoxicity. But it seems there is not even the slightest interest in what can be done to have THC-level sensory clarity without the shot memory. Like, are you all not getting the same effects from THC?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as a heavy smoker for about 15 years or so, I can easily tel you it does make people lazy but not only lazy it makes you content with not doing shit and I think that‚Äôs why many people stay with it because it has that special ingredient in it called ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù. I live in Canada and it‚Äôs completely legal here now and I‚Äôve noticed people who used to call people losers for smoking weed are now smoking weed. I think every weed head knows they would be more productive without it. Personally I love it though, I love the taste, smell and it enhanced my life at times although I feel like I wasted or missed opportunities in my life because I would rather sit at home and smoke. I smoke entirely way too much but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to. But everybody‚Äôs going to react differently to it, my body absolutely loves it I know I‚Äôm addicted and prolly will never quit</p>

<p>Therefore, the powerful elite or employers in general will dislike the fact that people care more about their quality time and self worth.¬†</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to get someone to work for you overtime and make you rich when their general attitude is &quot;screw rich people and their rat-race BS, I&#39;m gonna chill out and smoke a joint&quot;¬†</p>

<p>And also, the not giving a F attitude is retarded and I&#39;ve seen it happen to people that say that and do it and it just leads to them being more antisocial and unfriendly.

This exists in human nature without Marijuana, it&#39;s just one of many habitual behaviors that go along with this type of thinking. But who&#39;s to say what came first, the Marijuana use or the desire to be comfortable? It may just be that people who value their time and peace of mind are the types of people who are drawn to Marijuana not the other way around. Either way, there is a connection there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to smoke everyday but my chemistry changed on me. As much as I know I enjoyed it just as you did, I would never want to go back to wasting so much time and potential. If i was able to use it sparingly (and it still felt good with my different brain chem) I might want to, but I tried pretty much every drug you have heard of and never got as addicted as I was to weed. I was still able to achieve things but much less. I think if you truly feel okay with achieving less thats fine and mabye I put too much pressure on myself to be my best, but its a pursuit I love now, on top of just having more consistent energy, sleep, mood and memory. I really hope we as a culture can truly see weed for what it is, its a drug, much safer than pretty much all, but a powerful drug nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its obviously not the same as being addicted to harder substances, Im not arguing that. But Ive done all of those harder substances and never found myself struggling to avoid them, having it disrupt my life and waking up and within several hours wanting to do them like I did with weed. Nicotine to me isnt addictive at all, I have smoked cigs and hit vapes very occasionally since I was a teenager and through most of adult hood but never sought it out or craved it. Does my experience mean its not addictive? Obviously not. There are physical withdrawls from not smoking weed. it affected my eating for a long time even after quitting, luckily sleep improved after getting normal REM sleep back. Just because you personally dont have an issue with it, doesnt mean its not addictive. Anything that pleasurable can be addicting. Ive known stoners who tweak if they cant smoke, get pissed off etc. its a drug, safer than most, but a powerful drug that we have modified heavily from its natural state. Sounds to me like a part of your psyche is trying to justify your drug use to yourself. I havent met a stoner who claims weed isnt addictive in probably 15 years, I think everyone who isnt a teenager clearly can see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only just withdrawal specifically, when I used to smoke regularly even just not having enough weed to smoke constantly would take the joy out of everything. </p>

<p>Wake up? Smoke a bowl. Have work 2 hours later? If I didn&#39;t have that second bowl to smoke my entire workday would seem off. </p>

<p>Counterpoint? Even if I DID have that second bowl to smoke, my workday would be off as I&#39;d be all paranoid about my red eyes and getting clocked, likely have the munchies and get preoccupied with food until finally eating at lunchtime but hey, can&#39;t just smoke in the lunchroom at work godda go off and find a place to smoke which meant my vehicle or the woods and lunch would be about over by the time I finished. So then I found myself even hungrier and higher for the rest of my shift, oh, and confused. Mind always felt so damned foggy. </p>

<p>That same workday WITHOUT weed? Super clear minded, focused, no paranoia yet consumed with the need to get high and how much <em>better</em> my day could&#39;ve been if high.. </p>

<p>Weed is awesome for watching the first avatar, or pee wees big adventure at night with some munchies but (for me) not for much else. Weed was cool until it crossed over into my daily life and after that I just don&#39;t have any good memories from it, which probably makes sense. </p>

<p>For all I know I might have loved each second of work being high without all of the paranoia, but, likely due to weed, with a participation trophy for benzos, I just can&#39;t fucking remember and.. is that a good thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><sup>!Personal Opinion!:</sup> I just hate the fact it seems to downregulate the dopaminergic system. <del>Totally</del> That it may attenuate personal drive, motivation and zest to innovate and succeed. Never smoked personally, nor desire to try.</p>

<p>Now I believe it&#39;s ludicrous it&#39;s a schedule I substance and condemned in the US. You&#39;d notice the prohibition of 1920 had marvelous success; yet behold, recreational use of alcohol is now accepted and socially over glorified.</p>

<p>Cannabis has legitimate medical use through it&#39;s phytochemicals and certainly falls beneath alcohol in terms of personal impairment in judgement and subsequent &#39;risk&#39; to local safety. I&#39;m beating a dead horse though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the key things to point out here are &quot;heavy smoker&quot; and  &quot;addicted&quot;. You&#39;re doing it wrong, everything you do should be in moderation, especially drugs. No wonder an addiction is ruining your life it&#39;s kinda obvious.... And it depends on the type of person how weed affects you. Smoking in moderation can actually help you in ways and <em>make</em> you productive! Plus as someone with ADHD weed is a life saver for me some days. Everybody is different. And with a bit of research and moderation drugs can change your life for the better üòä</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My initial point on the first part is that people think they moderate it but don‚Äôt actually do it. Why? Because it‚Äôs easy to keep going, it‚Äôs in our nature wether it caffeine, fast food etc etc. why is it easy though with Weed? Well cause in simpler terms it releases the feel good chemical and also has us love the habit of it as well like going to eat food, sesh with friends, just sit down enjoy a good movie or activity and so on. For many it‚Äôs habitual and for many it‚Äôs chemically pleasing. </p>

<p>Again, as you agreed with me also, between weed and other vices like say caffeine it‚Äôs more detrimental to the normal cognitive function of the brain. And The more you intake anything the less you‚Äôll enjoy activities without it because you don‚Äôt feel as good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the same excuse people use for anything we should tell that to the successful cocaine abusers, functioning alcoholics, etc etc </p>

<p>You make no sense you‚Äôre just too proud to admit your addiction. And there are no successful people who are in the REAL world who used weed everyday to where they are now. Rappers aren‚Äôt everyday people, neither are celebs and shit many of them abuse many things </p>

<p>And if any of the people you can name are users but ‚Äúin moderation‚Äù then I see no problem. But I can give you countless examples of failed losers in every city and town going at it with weed and so can you and every other person. </p>

<p>Just because there are anomalies doesn‚Äôt make it any less negative towards productivity. Everything has anomalies </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I take cannibis specifically to slow my brain down. I had to abstain recently when I took the entrance exam for Mensa. What a &quot;little&quot; cannibis does for me is relax my brain enough to be more creative, but it slows my cognitive function considerably. Once I&#39;m actuslly high, I don&#39;t want to do shit. But I take it for a specific reason and so I am careful not to cross the too high line unless I have absolutely nothing to do (which is almost never).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THC makes many people lazy and unmotivated (albeit some people do have more productivity with it). It is an easy source of dopamine that requires little effort. THC increase anxiety for many people. For the people who use it as a anxiolytic, they will likely have an anxiety increasing rebound effect during cessation. THC is detrimental for sleep quality and short term memory.¬†</p>

<p>Physically speaking smoking Cannabis is not good for lung health. Cannabis usage is correlated with cardiovascular issues.</p>

<p>CBD has a bunch of benefits which can help offset some of the detrimental effects of THC.¬†</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, yes, but, like, am I crazy here for being wowed by how much it just opens a relatively normal world of sensory experience? Psychedelics open up the doors too, but they open up too many doors and you feel more like a hyper-perceptive alien while THC is more like a continuation of your normal life but with the resolution turned up. Yes, you&#39;ve brought up more real downsides. It does suppress dreaming, smoking it is bad, and, prolonged use does see to tend toward laziness even if initially it may spur productivity.</p>

<p>But dear lord, people are talking about how to achieve the amazing pain relief it offers without the negative side effects. Why is nobody wowed by the sensory information superhighway it opens to at least <em>wish</em> for a way to get there without side effects?</p>

<p>Best to use sparingly and for special occasion.¬†</p>

<p>For example I‚Äôve heard Cannabis usage is quite common in the ultra marathon scene. If someone becomes accustomed to using Cannabis during runs, then the runs without Cannabis are going to be worse. Now for them, the activity of running will be interconnected to Cannabis usage. It‚Äôs almost like becoming dependent on Cannabis in order to run well.¬†</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying as a whole the community doesn&#39;t see it as a good thing because it does do things in the background that is negative. </p>

<p>I am confident because most anecdotes are pretty in line with this in the real world. Most don&#39;t and they end up being put on a lower trajectory in life. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible to benefit from that I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s very rare for a variety of reasons be it genetic or your personality of how you use it. Studies generally back this up as well as well (negative effects). Of course there&#39;s no real way to actually factually say that, but if we just look at it scientifically, it&#39;s not good for most people, especially long term, and outside of pain management.</p>

<p>I mean personally if I divide all the people I know consume versus the ones that don&#39;t there&#39;s a pretty clear answer there, but I&#39;m also aware that there are people online that do fine, could they do better, sure, are they at their best... hmmm idk. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a kind of wisdom that normal people in real life have. Most successful adults out there aren&#39;t weeded out, and you know that the average person especially the average young person isn&#39;t going to be like a coder or hacker or something where weed helps them if they&#39;re even predisposed to that. Most people use it in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons and it hurts them, and they don&#39;t even realize it so they&#39;ll go out of their way to go on the internet or talk to other people and just boast about that constantly which is a stereotype. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a net negative the more people are exposed to it. Yes you can benefit, but 9/10 you&#39;re not that kind of person to. </p>

<p>My main point with the creative Fields thing was that a lot of people hype themselves up to be so great and they&#39;ll do all these drugs to try and enhance their performance or creativity but it it doesn&#39;t really end up working out because it&#39;s difficult to do so. It&#39;s a rat race really, no offense to them. They also end up making little money which sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading this thread is strange. EVERYONE I worked with (in very respectable and high paying positions) admitted to using, and they are some of the most productive, successful, motivated people I know. I also met a group of folks back in my college days who dropped out, and all they did was smoke weed. I&#39;ve seen both &quot;reactions&quot; to the stuff, and all it says to me is that generalizations are useless. It&#39;s like technology - tech in and of itself isn&#39;t bad, but it can be used in both bad and good ways. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like anything else. People often make bad decisions when it comes to ANY substance (caffeine, sugar). No one is going this hard on those things, even though A LOT of ppl are addicted to both, probably because both of them support the daily grind and that&#39;s seen as a &quot;good&quot; thing.</p>

<p>I use. Sure, my memory has taken a dive a bit, but I also got promoted recently, started a YouTube channel, and I&#39;m in the best shape of my life thanks to an <em>increased motivation</em> to exercise. As someone who is always in my head, it has helped me be more connected with my body and the sensory gifts the OP mentioned. </p>

<p>As a creative person trying to make a living off of it, weed has little to do with the difficulty of the industry. People aren&#39;t using because they think its the key to their big break. It DOES help with creative flow, though. And trust, creatives aren&#39;t the only ones into weed üòÜ There are other reasons one might want a creative boost - they don&#39;t need to be a struggling artist or an artist of any kind. It&#39;s good for problem solving and thinking outside of the box.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I really don&#39;t understand your argument here. Couldn&#39;t you say the same thing about any drug that has benefits? &quot;Why is nobody wowed by the sensory information superhighway MDMA opens to at least wish for a way to get there without side effects?&quot;</p>

<p>Most of your argument is along the lines of &quot;THC feels so good and makes things more interesting, why don&#39;t people like it?&quot;. I mean, that is exactly the reason why it&#39;s addictive and potentially harmful with chronic use, and it&#39;s why a lot of people look down on it. When you do an activity that&#39;s pleasurable, all other activities become less pleasurable by comparison so you&#39;ll start to prefer more pleasurable activities.</p>

<p>Many people would wish that there&#39;s a way to remove weed and other drugs&#39; side effects; that&#39;s why we dedicate so much time and money to R&amp;D for drugs. If you want to argue that we should do more research into weed, that&#39;s one thing. I just don&#39;t understand your argument for why people shouldn&#39;t look down on weed. It&#39;s just generally not a healthy substance to take frequently, or honestly at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think that perceptual effects are, at first thought, at least, distinct from euphoric effects? I don&#39;t think having a distinct, effortless awareness of the quiet hum of a small electrical motor in my room has to coincide with pleasure. In the case of weed it does, and it&#39;s unfortunate that this results in tolerance and lower feeling of well being upon discontinuation. But a lower intensity threshold for representing phenomena in your conscious awareness seems like something that should be free. You&#39;re already paying the price because it takes longer to sift the truly relevant from the irrelevant and you risk sensory overload. We&#39;re used to nootropics that grant HD vision without any euphoric elements. That much should at least be grounds for wondering if weed is merely an imperfect delivery vehicle for enhanced awareness, no? Why throw out the baby with the bathwater?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Why do people look down on alcohol? Alcohol makes people more talkative and outgoing, leading to better conversations and connections with others. Yes, alcohol is poison and it has negative health consequences in any quantity, but what if it didn&#39;t? Why is nobody wowed by alcohol&#39;s ability to enhance social experiences?&quot; </p>

<p>I get where you&#39;re coming from and I agree that weed has some really interesting perceptual effects, but I&#39;m trying to explain that your argument just doesn&#39;t make logical sense. Why would even the remote possibility of weed becoming 100% healthy to use in the future change people&#39;s perception of how weed is used today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bro, it flew over his head. He really doesnt understand what you mean with &quot;enhanced sensory perception.&quot; I have first hand experience with it, i agree its amazing. I use it for my workouts (enhanced mind-muscle connection) its almost a PED.</p>

<p>Hes on his high horse about this aspect being &quot;dangerous&quot; gtfo here</p>

<p>edit: basically, that enhanced sensory perception is a meditative state, weed is a shortcut to that meditative state, so it really matters what you allow to go in your mind while youre high, you want to brainwash yourself with self empowering types of things, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs a tool, like anything. Everyone here is commenting that it makes you lazy, but I disagree with such a broad and decisive statement. That‚Äôs a matter of one‚Äôs internal physiology, psychology, and habits, so let‚Äôs bring a little bit of nuance into this discussion. </p>

<p>If someone uses cannabis to dissociate from life, and does it daily, then yeah that‚Äôs obviously not a healthy or optimal use pattern. </p>

<p>However, there are many people who do it once in a blue moon to unwind and connect with themselves. There are people who do it frequently but at a low dose. This could be to boost creative thinking (I know people in tech who do this), or to help with back pain. Or to treat anxiety. </p>

<p>Just because there are lazy complacent stoners out there does not imply that there are not healthy and productive ways to use cannabis. </p>

<p>The impact on your life that you get from cannabis is much more a reflection of the way you are living your life than anything else.</p>

My ex best friend is a die hard stoner and is one of the worst dead beat people I ever met. All he wanted to do was sit around smoking weed and watching TV.

    <div class="md"><p>10mg/kg is an insanely high dose imo.  For me that would be 550mg.  If I eat 50mg in an edible I‚Äôm fucked for 24 hours.  I know it‚Äôs moot to compare rat data with human experience, but 10mg/kg is an unrealistic test point for the majority of consumers, even heavy consumers.  </p>

<p>To be honest though, memory and learning issues with cannabis are overstated.  If I smoke a big joint in the morning and continue all day, of course it impacts these things negatively, but guess what - I can just <em>not</em> smoke too much and it appears to have a net positive effect compared to me at baseline.  It‚Äôs not a substance which forces you to continue heavy use to avoid severe withdrawal, like opioids, alcohol etc. so really if you‚Äôre having memory loss or other negative side effects, just cut back and you‚Äôll be fine.</p>

It‚Äôs just not actually that safe to use; EVERYONE has at least a couple people in their family with mental health issues which means that also EVERYONE is at risk of developing or exacerbating one via marijuana use.</p>

<p>My best friend of over 10 years only ever smoked marijuana, grew his own &amp; only smoked his own. He made his money selling to medical only dispensaries and was trusted in that world for the quality of his weed. He developed schizophrenia from smoking weed too much, too often, and for far too many years. He committed suicide by stripping himself naked and walking across the freeway to be hit by a semi truck. He left his clothes folded on the side of the road. </p>

<p>I have had a handful of friends become bipolar, panic disorder, schizophrenia, etc. and all they ever did drugs wise was marijuana. Another friend of mine tried to bleed himself dry because they were convinced we replaced their blood with cough syrup after giving them some to help them with a cold they had developed after running around town all night bare naked. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs dismissive to argue against it not being safe for most people.</p>

<p>Long ago I liked it. Reflecting back I wish I hadn‚Äôt used it regularly during younger years, because it‚Äôs impossible to tell whether it had a cognitive impact on present day me.

    <div class="md"><p>People who are loyal to weed act like it has much more profoundly positive effects that it actually does. In my experience it&#39;s really not that deep. Those peoples&#39; defensive attitude around it and anger at the slightest criticism is annoying. Most won&#39;t recognize they&#39;re addicted </p>

<p>People who use weed a lot that claim it helps their mental health problems (helps their anxiety, &quot;calms them down&quot; etc.) never actually had those problems before they started smoking weed. It saps motivation and drive (people will claim the opposite of course). </p>

<p>It really poisons your mind in a lot of ways. </p>

<p>You get high and feel stupid and hungry. Music sounds and food tastes good. To me, you&#39;re much better off sober than using something to make food taste and music sound good.</p>

<p>Smoking weed as an adolescent left me with permanent cognitive problems, which ultimately led to other large problems in my life. It is without a doubt the single greatest regret I have and led me down a profoundly different path than I was otherwise destined to follow.</p>

<p>According to a family member who has a dispensary‚Ä¶Frankly, weed doesn‚Äôt have the best PR firms behind them. That and government in Cali ruined it by over taxing it making it difficult for those who really need it for medicinal purposes. Now many weed dispensaries have closed shop or grouped with other dispensaries to try to make a buck. That and the lack of QC. If you look at Cali they only distributed a certain amount of QC licenses and it wasn‚Äôt for the average Joe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of this really matters since I&#39;m bigger and taller than you but I&#39;ll bite. Your life is so bereft of meaning and purpose that you post about GTA and red dead redemption on reddit, after the age of 21, gaming should be no more than a very very occasional hobby, you should be working on your career and/or socialising, training, developing skills etc. So, given that you don&#39;t appear to be doing any of the things a man should be doing, from this we can infer that you&#39;re likely a socially inept couch-potato man-child who has no real hobbies, skills or athletic talent, nor have you likely ever done any martial art or combat sport let alone had a fist-fight. Let me guess, unemployed too?</p>

<p>Keep indulging in the fantasy where you are somehow the one who is capable of smacking anyone around, but I know for a fact that if you saw me in real life you&#39;d not even be able to maintain eye contact, I have worked to afford myself the luxury of knowing for a fact I could slap your jaw off of your face, absolutely bizarre the self-delusion people like you are capable of, yet you want to claim that all the hallucinogens etc you never shut the fuck up about have somehow calmed your ego down. Imagine being one of these guys and yet having less self-awareness than a tren-abuser lmaooooo huge Ls for you all-round.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a shotter in my younger years so even when I was 15 you&#39;d have been losing at your own game by being one of the junkies giving their social welfare to me, you are and will always be a loser in every aspect of your life.</p>

<p>Edit: You also said &quot;I guarantee your little bitch&quot;, you mean &quot;you&#39;re&quot;, as in &quot;you are&quot;? Evidently I&#39;m also more intelligent than you too since you can&#39;t grasp very basic English.</p>

<p>Yes music sounds better, I feel good, but I feel good doing absolutely nothing to better my life. I would rather be stressed out and being productive than sitting on my couch leaving my house a mess and being okay with not getting anything done</p>

<p>Now it‚Äôs not like alcohol where you get stupid and make stupid decisions, it also doesn‚Äôt wipe you out the next day with a hangover, but even alcohol makes people want to get up and do things, weed doesn‚Äôt (in my experience). Also, due to the perception that weed isn‚Äôt that bad for health, people are okay with smoking all day every day. Smoking before work, before events, before grocery shopping, a lot of smokers I know are high most of the day. I don‚Äôt believe that is a healthy way to live, even if it doesn‚Äôt destroy your organs like alcohol would</p>

<p>No mental clarity no good high - none of it - not a single bit of it - was ever worth it to me.

So wrong. Wrongest of wrongs. </p>

<p>I wish I had known there was more to thc than &quot;high&quot; ness prior to using, but I suppose that&#39;s on me for not doing the research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your curiosity! I have a history of being successfully academically and professionally (student and employee) and after 2 months of thc I became fully non functional was having delusions and hallucinations and the only substance I had abused was thc for the span of about 2 months (I was a first timer and it was a maladaptive coping mechanism to grief after loss). </p>

<p>I stopped showing up to work, became clinically insane, and had to visit the hospital 3 times and had many concerned family and friends some of which who don&#39;t see me the same anymore - some of which who said my disorderly self and erratic behavior traumatized them. </p>

<p>I had a diagnosis of an MI after using, and that pretty much wrote off the beginning of the end of my life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been 2 years since then, and I&#39;m still grappling with everything I lost. This would have been my graduation year for my masters program had I not delved into substances and acted a fool.</p>

<p>Self-love and self forgiveness have been a priority for me in therapy, but I gotta tell you, it&#39;s ain&#39;t easy.</p>

<p>Biggest regret of my life, and I still haven&#39;t recovered from the psychological damage it did and the reputation of mine - I utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>If y&#39;all are able to consume thc and be fine power to ya! But some of us can not, and we suffer drastically because of these mistakes.</p>

<p>Results, published in the Journal of Nursing Scholarship , from 2014 to 2020 386 people died as a result of cannabis use. That&#39;s 66 people a year. Nearly 99 percent of individuals using cannabis and synthetic cannabis died from accidents. You cannot have a fatal overdose of cannabis (does not include synthetic, a questionable lab created drug).</p>

<p>The study was only for Florida, but compared to alcohol, statistics show that cannabis is much less dangerous.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple studies I found, I copied and pasted the quotes from the Google preview + linked to it for convenience, as I am typing this on my phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C23&amp;q=cannabis+use+and+dementia&amp;oq=cannabis+use+and+demen#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1709174735843&amp;u=%23p%3DDd_FW1yAswYJ">&quot;There were no significant differences in cognitive decline between heavy users, light users, and nonusers of cannabis.&quot;</a></p>

<p>In researching I only found one case study that seemed to support the idea of cannabis seeming to have an impact in the development of disorders such as dementia. I, of course, linked it below.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-023-04956-w">&quot;presented case highlights the profound impact of cannabis consumption on brain structure and chemistry, including the potential for neurodegenerative disorders like frontotempal disorder.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Albeit, some of the studies are decently old, but I found no other results that seemed to indicate either way. I&#39;m interested in reading the studies you found regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone whose addiction is sugar and reading I think low of recreational drugs (but have respect of those who like them and still manage to live a good life) and specially those that require putting  smoke in my lungs. Marijuana should be only for medical purposes IMHO, and it&#39;s long due to put real restrictions on nicotine instead of just playing with corporate interests. Nothing worse to ruin your skin than cutting oxygen from your skin cells with nicotine and marijuana.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in this argument that if nicotine is sort of legal marijuana should be too. You may have a point and marijuana should be legal but Give me a better argument. And we already have a lot of driving accidents caused by people who drive under effects of alcohol. Now we will have to add those who drive influenced by marijuana?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s passed I&#39;m okay with that, just don&#39;t say it should be legal because nicotine is legal. Alcohol is different though, it&#39;s part of the diet of the blue zones, where people live past 100 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve smoked cannabis for 30 years and for a majority of those years it served me well. It used to help my mood, helped me enjoy mundane daily tasks, but that is not the case any longer.
Recently I started micro-dosing psilocybin every-other-day, with a monthly macrodose. I&#39;ve been doing that for about 4 months. What this seems to have brought to the forefront of my mind is that cannabis no longer serves me well. I was finding myself feeling lethargic and content to ignore things that needed doing. It&#39;s been about 2 weeks since I quit smoking altogether and I&#39;m noticing improvements in my motivation, instead of sitting around doing little and being ok with it, I&#39;m finding myself being bored with being stagnant, with being a couch potato.
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ll never smoke cannabis again, but it&#39;s just not an important thing to me anymore. I dont want to smoke as soon as I get home from work. I want to do things, take care of responsibilities that I&#39;ve been neglecting. Daily smoking is just not for me anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your statement on enhancing sensory! Music, going for walks, meditation, yoga, and intimacy are my favorite sensory experiences with cannabis. It even helps me with processing when I‚Äôm doing EMDR therapy. I find if I use cannabis after therapy, I‚Äôll continue processing, make connections, and have emotional releases‚Äî it‚Äôs been an effective tool in conjunction with therapy. I do think intention helps!</p>

<p>Also, I have an awful condition called MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) and cannabis edibles/tinctures are a miracle medicine in that regard. I personally love high ratio CBG, CBN, or CBD to low THC. I find regular low doses help treat multiple symptoms like systemic pain, nausea, anxiety, stress, restlessness/irritability, insomnia, muscle tension, depression, food aversion‚Äî  higher doses for flare ups/attacks. It also helps heal the gut and calm the nervous system. If you can get your medical license and speak with a cannabis informed practitioner (or do your own research) to find what strains, cannabanoids, terpenes, dosing protocol, is best for you, it can bring about many health and QoL benefits! ‚Äîobviously it‚Äôs very stigmatized, and some people do not mesh well with it. It‚Äôs not a cure all, but for many, including myself, it is a wonderful, even life saving, medicine. When chronic debilitating suffering has eroded my will to continue on, cannabis is one of the few things that has kept me on this earth. If you have a chronic health condition that causes chronic suffering, I recommend giving edibles/tinctures a try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me personally it&#39;s that most weed smokers I know seem to think it&#39;s the wonder cure for all ailments and they don&#39;t care about any other natural remedies. It&#39;s pretty frustrating.</p>

<p>I had a friend who died of cancer. For her particular type of cancer, weed was not advised since it actually accelerates the spread. She only learnt later and quit taking it, but still, every other person told her to use it to cure her cancer. It was so condescending and insensitive. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t react well to either THC or CBD. I don&#39;t mind people around me smoking, but I&#39;m so tired of everyone telling me that I just haven&#39;t found the right strain. My friends and hubby love to smoke and I don&#39;t mind it, but I tend to leave their company when they&#39;re going at it heavy, since the conversations become completely nonsensical. </p>

<p>I believe it has its place (also totally legal over here), but it&#39;s not the ambrosia of the gods that smokers make it out to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dood as a major lover of the herb...it literally does the opposite of clarifying anything for real. Just look at images from Amen Brain Clinic Brain SPECT scans when cannabis, is vaped, smoked or ingested. The brain literally goes dark..in other words blood circulation just drops....the normally bright areas are dimmed. Yes there are some interesting and novel changes to the brain under cannabis use. But largely it just cools the whole thing down by reducing cerebral blood flow. This is not the stuff of serious invention ..may come up with a cool new part of a song or a painting..but do not mistake it for the kind of work a tuned mind can perform on modern nootropics and exercise. The brain is the exact opposite appearance when it is up and fully running.  It is quite impressive actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the nootropic community is particularly interested in having your brain function at the highest level possible. While THC and some strong terpenes like terpinolene can have positive productivity effects, it does slow the blood flow to the brain. Now i‚Äôm not arguing that a slow blood flow to the brain is a bad thing, in fact, I think we need to slow our brains down from time to time, if not daily. But I don‚Äôt think the nootropic community are considering if we as human beings need our brains functioning at such a high level day in and day out. It‚Äôs the same argument for consuming caffeine on a daily basis or taking amphetamines like Adderall. Our society has deemed that our brains need to function at maximum strength to get a particular job done. Sure, that‚Äôs effective in some industries or for some individuals, but not all.

It‚Äôs simply not a sustainable practice yet the narrative around it is it‚Äôs either as bad as heroin or its perfect divine medicine that can do no harm. Neither are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, there such things as self-control and moderation. So everyone who has a glass of wine at night is an alcoholic? I had a donut yesterday, I must be a chronic binger.</p>

<p>Maybe you should turn to alcohol and opioids.</p>

<p>Alcohol = 140,000 deaths in the US every year</p>

<p>Opioids = (2021) 80,411 reported overdose deaths in US</p>

<p>Cannabis = <a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/marijuana">https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/marijuana</a> No deaths from overdose has ever been reported. </p>

<p>The only thing I could find on cannabis and deaths was a Florida study that took 6 years of data. There were about 64 deaths a year related to cannabis use. 99% of them were due to accidents. 100% of them were in urban areas (thus the accidents). And since they couldn&#39;t call cannabis dangerous or addicting they added:</p>

<p>&quot;...for some people, cannabis can be addictive and potentially cause harm <strong>when taken with other substances such as alcohol or other drugs</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Seriously, Florida Study? Jell-o can be addictive and potentially cause harm when taken with other substances such as alcohol and other drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though people don&#39;t realize that weed ruins people&#39;s lives not by killing them but by taking away their motivations and their aspirations and various aspects of their cognition. </p>

<p>But alcohol is way more obvious because someone could get drunk and hurt someone or kill someone while driving right? Let&#39;s make the death comparison so weed doesn&#39;t look as bad. </p>

<p>Sorry but most people who try it only try it to their negative detriment, and the fact that more people are trying it these days especially younger people is really bad. But only time and statistics will tell oh well. Maybe another example could be not brushing your teeth or not getting exercise those things are bad but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s going to kill you and be a tragedy but it does take away from your life in considerable ways that you don&#39;t realize until it&#39;s too late</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly because people don‚Äôt understand how to dose it properly, and it makes them scared. For a lot of people it puts them in their head way too much and they get paranoid. I think people actually overthink it, instead of just using it and chilling out they get all in their head about how high they are, kind of the opposite of how people are with alcohol and stimulants.</p>

<p>I actually think it‚Äôs great for exercise, which people might find surprising because it is associated with laziness but I would say it actually is associated with continuity/endurance. Like if you have some on the couch and don‚Äôt get up you might stay on the couch all day, but if you just get up and start moving you might keep moving for hours. </p>

<p>It is certainly not a nootropic in the traditional sense. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good for things like math or articulating linear arguments. It is however great for creativity enhancement and editing work that has already been partially flushed out. Memory effects seem to vary overall if you pay close enough attention and have a good enough memory in the first place it might not block your memory in a noticeable way but it certainly dampens memory formation.</p>

<p>Basically people look down on weed cause they are prejudiced, due to a mixture of factors including their own fear filled experiences with it, stoners in their lives not being able to find the balance and overusing and then over sharing about their overuse, and overall lack of a culture that knows how and when to use weed for productivity purposes. So some of the prejudice is legit but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be a very useful tool in the right hands.</p>

I will definitely say I believe, from personal experience, weed use makes DPDR more likely and can <em>aggravate</em> pre-existing conditions... But for me, that aggravation of my pre-existing conditions is exactly what I <em>NEEDED</em> to realize what I had to focus on to become mentally healthier--after experiencing enough negative episodes while using weed, I was able to recignize the patterns of when they occurred and thus I was able to figure out what was causing them--without weed, I would have continued to ignore and supress those underlyimg problems.</p>

<p>I did hit rock bottom before going back up, and you can say weed led me to rock bottom, but I have been a daily weed user for the last 4 years and for the last 3 years I have only been getting better when it comes to my mental health, my physical health, my financial standing, and my social standing/relationships. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

On top of that I microdose periodically using mushroom gummies. These two have helped me overcome a 10 year depression brought on by the death of a woman I loved and intended to marry. I didn‚Äôt just lose everything that I had worked for after that. I just walked away from it and let myself go. No self care, minimal hygiene, no joy in life. I hated being alive but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to cause my family the pain of losing their father, brother and son. I began micro dosing about 2 years ago and started smoking weed again after 40 years without it. I have my lazy spells but I feel that as hard as I‚Äôve worked to take care of others, I deserve it. I get more done at home than I have in a long time. In short, I‚Äôm getting myself back! I haven‚Äôt been myself since the trauma that I put myself through 13 years ago. I‚Äôm more rational and more productive and confident than ever. I don‚Äôt recommend this for everyone but it‚Äôs worked wonders for me.

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people chalking it up to getting stoned and vegging out. It‚Äôs all personally dependent. Weed is not ideal for productivity for most in that there is no direct influence on benefitting productivity. However, those who do benefit do greatly. First it‚Äôs dose dependent. Sipping on a vape or a low dose edible for the day is not the same as getting baked and passing out watching tv. I use cannabis and it reduces my joint inflammation which allows me to be active, work more, sleep better. It also helps me with eating and if I‚Äôm not eating it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm high or not, I am not productive.</p>

<p>It all boils down to responsible use and personal response. If it works for you, great. It it doesn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt formulate a definitive conclusion when there‚Äôs such a spectrum when it comes to use and abuse of cannabis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the moment, I&#39;m taking a break from weed and I feel a lot better. Much more mentally sharp and emotionally stable. My normal pattern is weekends only, but its so easy to slide into every night. And at least for me, it affects my drive and I think makes my depression symptoms worse over time.</p>

<p>But frequency and dose really matter. When I limit myself to once a week and a 10 or 20 mg edible, I&#39;m good. But its so easy to slip to into daily use, and that&#39;s when I notice more severe after effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been smoking weed for the past 17 years, almost every single day, multiple times a day.</p>

<p>Weed has an effect on &quot;flow&quot; that I have been unable to find in any other substance. When I combine stimulating nootropics, such as phenylpiracetam, modafinil, or even just citicoline with weed (wrapped in tobacco), I feel at ease with the stimulating effect, almost as if my body is not fighting the rush, but working with it.</p>

<p>I have had night terrors since a child, and weed has helped me sleep through the night without the constant heart racing and vivid nightmares every night.</p>

<p>Does it make me lazy? No fucking way. I smoke, and then do farm work, organize things, take my daughter to the park, cook fantastic meals.</p>

<p>Am i addicted to the stuff? Well, yeah, and not to justify its overuse, most certainly not for everyone either, it&#39;s been something I have been reliably able to achieve a nootropic effect from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had a bad side-effect. It&#39;s always been immensely helpful when navigating my life. I have a crazy good job and a nice lifestyle. Been using cannabis since I was 13. </p>

<p>I think the blanket statements are just a cop-out. Just like every other substance, there are some people it&#39;s good for and some it&#39;s not. I have a lot of experience dealing with medical providers that infuse their personal bias into their treatment plans instead of sticking to the book or the papers.</p>

<p>Guess who was depressed and never did anything post-military and taking a ton of shit from the VA... Guess who picked cannabis back up and skyrocketed into a career with plenty of yield.</p>

<p>I sleep like a baby, can remember things verbatim, and get my ass up to complete the labor that needs doing.</p>

<p>If a patient says something is working and has no other complaints, the medical provider usually just says &quot;Okay great&quot;. To experiment with other medications would just be counterintuitive and frustrating. Doctors like that piss me off lol. </p>

<p>My neighbor is an awesome doctor and we&#39;ve had this discussion and he totally agrees. He&#39;s just not allowed to use cannabis due to his job.</p>

 I love the way that it can enhance your thoughts and open your mind when meditating on a problem or listening to music. But to really function, in your life, it should be limited to just weekend use or less.</p>

I found this to be especially true when I was trying to get stuff done on my laptop at home. Getting into a flow state is easier without cannabis, ginko baloba has worked well for me. Adderall also gets you into a flow state....but the long term side effects can make it counterproductive. Getting hyper focused on the bad things happening that you can&#39;t be happy with all the good things. Clenching your jaw and grinding your teeth, etc.</p>

It&#39;s real to you, and great for you having the heightened sensory experience, but you are not experiencing something that&#39;s above average .. you are without any doubt, definitely engaging with below average and enjoying it above average expectations.</p>

<p>I have a ton of experience with this, grew up running corners, being the biggest drug dealer at raves, you are definitely, 100%, without any doubt wrong about your presumptions. Weed is for sure helping you endure and even enjoy mundane garbage, but is not heightening anything. You are getting no objective clarity. Which is a conundrum. You are enjoying yourself, which is a goal achieved. Others who don&#39;t partake are not. You&#39;re able to enjoy stuff that most people agree sucks, but most people that don&#39;t partake are not able to really enjoy anything.</p>

We create an association with elevated dopamine levels and certain activities like eating, sex, watching TV, gaming, etc. the problem therein lies that we forget how to enjoy these same activities sober.

<p>Personally I never feel numb or relaxed on weed.  I find it highly stimulating (yes that includes Indica and high CBD blends) because of the intense thoughts and observations it gives me.  Some of these thoughts can be unpleasant, causing anxiety.  Some however are very insightful.</p>

<p>I use weed 2-4x a month, almost always by myself, with a journal and some music, to just write out whatever comes up‚Ä¶it clears my subconscious a bit, gives me new ideas, kind of an emotional reset.</p>

<p>That said, when I reread the journal sober, there‚Äôs some pretty dumb thoughts/insights too, so I discard those.</p>

<p>Sometimes THC just doesn&#39;t agree with strong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neuronaut">MEGOs</a>. There used to be an issue of overdosing both alcohol and cannabis before this date. Nowadays people are TikTok, YouTube, Reddit and FB wiser. Much smaller dosing. Now Microdosing is even a thing. </p>

<p>Also, THC and CBD ratios are an actual consideration. In the UK it used to be Skunk )(High THC) or nothing. There are even very low THC (equivalent of alcohol free) versions/strains available. Sadly most people are behind the &#39;Curve Of Progress&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This particular community seems extremely close-minded for one based around expanding your consciousness and abilities through supplementation of myriad substances, often ones with at least some mild psychoactivity.  I have a weird feeling that Kratom wouldn‚Äôt receive such a shitfest as weed on this sub, despite it being a genuinely addictive opioid.  It is rather funny and also quite depressing to witness, being someone who actively experiments with nootropics plus everything else.  Is this the mindset these substances cause you to occupy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know if I&#39;m exactly an exclusion here, but if I smoke weed sparingly and prevent tolerance buildup it is great for things like working out and it gives me almost stimulant level of energy while also giving great pain relief. The thing I love the most on it is swimming and cycling and I can do those for hours on it. The only time I&#39;ve had the motivation decline from it is if I use it chronically, chase highs, and if I have a tolerance. It is a amazing tool if you use it once a week or less in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of disagreement on this topic. From everything I‚Äôve read and understand it‚Äôs only really harmful to teenagers because they are still developing and it can cause problems with the development of their brains. I have a prescription and personally don‚Äôt get enlightened and don‚Äôt care much for the dizziness and slow thinking it can cause. But everyone reacts differently. But I do take it for sleep because I‚Äôve had MAJOR issues with sleeping. But I only take Indica drops and refuse to smoke anything. My phone and watch track my sleep including how much REM and Deep sleep etc I get. These drops have helped me tremendously. I‚Äôve also taken CBN for pain and I believe it is probably healthier than aspirin and Tylenol etc. 
So, yes, maybe some people just have it ingrained in their upbringing that it is horrible stuff, when it is really better than many alternatives if (like anything), it‚Äôs not overused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it sounds like I&#39;m repeating myself so many times in this thread, but I admit that weed has issues. The part I&#39;m not understanding is how are people just... unbothered by the relevation, you know? Say, you go to a wine tasting, and the sommelier is telling you about all these flavors in the wine. You sip it, and it just tastes like another sour grape juice. You pretend you got it all, but inside you wonder if they&#39;re all just faking it? Are they all a bunch of pretentious assholes huffing their own verbal farts? Maybe you google some studies done about how wine tasters got tricked into appraising a wine as red by simply dying it. You ask some friends and they say that you just have to keep at it and practice - the same cope they have about intelligence.</p>

<p>Then you take some THC. And suddenly, the world has opened up. You can taste all these features the sommelier described. Hell, you don&#39;t even need him. You can just find some random wine and make your own tasting notes. It&#39;s not that you were ever inarticulate or hampered by inexperience, you were simply &quot;taste blind&quot;. Before, it really was just sour grape juice to you - you simply had no initial material to work with. </p>

<p>How is that not one of the most amazing things? How can anyone stand just going back into the darkness, knowing there is all this real stuff out there that is hidden from you everywhere you go? How can you keep living knowing that there are people out there who were just born perceiving so much more with their senses? How does it not gnaw at your mind to realize that just as you, with your intelligence, can understand concepts which elude others, so can these people navigate sensory reality with precision, adroitness and ease that will ever elude you in your baseline state? How do you not feel anguish that there is no pathway to seeing the fullness of reality but an unreliable drug with some anti-nootropic side-effects?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not hearing detail in songs or giving yourself sensory clarity.  No such thing as causing your brain to miss fire = enhancement.</p>

<p>Brain miss firing does = susceptible to delusions.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Look at Emergency room visits in legalized countries before and after.   Admittance to psychiatric wards has doubled.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The enhancement you think you are getting, is the increase of neurotransmitter signalling in the brain, because Weed has a stimulant effect, think along the lines of caffeine, amphetamine, SSRI and cocaine.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>But the effect is short lived, and follows up with a generally minor depressive like crash, and a few days to a week of poor mental clarity, as your body works to dislodge and dispose of the THC molecules that just got stuck in the layers of fat in your brain.</p>

<p>This is also why pot heads become couch potato&#39;s.  That boost you get is followed by a crash as your brain slams on the brakes to your neurotransmitters in a attempt to undo the damage your just caused by over stimulation.  It&#39;s this over stimulation that you think is improved sensory, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s a deception.  You want improved sensory? Eat a apple, get some sleep and get physically fit and exercise.</p>

<p>Now if you smoke way to much, It can trigger panic attacks and anxiety, then you are in a world of shit, as you have to quit using and it can take again a few days to a few weeks to resolve and now you are looking at a depressive crash and all the nasty shit that comes with depression.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The stats don&#39;t lie, people do.  look at E.R. visits many hospitals make those numbers public.</p>

<p>In short, if you gonna toke, keep it small and spread it out, like weeks apart or even a month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s different for everybody. Realize that people in cognitive enhancement/nootropic forums approach drugs much differently and much smarter. </p>

<p>Most people especially young people don&#39;t use it to much benefit/insight. Yes obviously it changes your perception but most people don&#39;t make much use out of it and how it affects their motivations and brain over time is not good. </p>

<p>And I said this before but people who use it recklessly or meaninglessly or to harm aren&#39;t going to be hanging around on the internet to talk about it, especially on places like this subreddit. There are lots of self-selection biases on the internet, and also just a lot of lying on the internet as well because people can say whatever they want. </p>

<p>And lots of people do thc in the nootropic community. Obviously everyone knows that it has negatives on cognition in several ways, but they&#39;re ok with it. Maybe they have favorable genetics, or they really dont need the besy cognition in the place they are in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cannabis is actually a deeply underrated nootropic imo. cannabinoids play a crucial role in extinction learning. this is especially important to consider for people with PTSD/CPTSD, or serious anxiety, as it improves the ability to form new responses to stimuli that was previously associated with stressful experiences. however, people that drink alcohol typically have adverse reactions to weed and tend to report paranoia and an increase rather than a decrease of anxiety, and this is due to their gabba receptors being altered via alcohol habituation. pretty much 95 percent of people consume alcohol. i don&#39;t drink, personally, it&#39;s never been my thing, so I&#39;ve never had anything but positive experiences with cannabis, and find it very helpful in conjunction with coffee for writing, math, making music, study, and even running/working out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the abuse of it and the ‚Äúculture‚Äù that has stigmatized it. </p>

<p>CBD on the other hand, is praised in some scientific circles and has multiple benefits. Hemp is praised in some environmental circles and also receives heavy praise.</p>

<p>With that said, there can be an argument for marijuana (thc) but it would be with small dose personal use. The people who could benefit from it most are actually usually high strung, power abusive, people who lack true purpose anyway, ironically. </p>

<p>The people who I knew growing up who used THC primarily didn‚Äôt have access to CBD or other things that promote general wellness and mental well-being that is available widely now. </p>

<p>For most people who were once users of THC or have a history of the abuse of THC can give you MANY stories about why most people do NOT need it and are better off with alternatives. Most will liken it to alcohol, due to alcohol also being something ABUSED for a time by people who were already social degenerates. Alcohol or THC itself generally isn‚Äôt the issue. Usually it‚Äôs a people problem. But because of its ABUSE, many people connect marijuana (thc) with negative ideas/feelings, including criminal activity, sexual deviancy, laziness, burnout lifestyle, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are a few comments from a 60-year-old guy.
1. Some of us can smoke and function normally while others of us like me can&#39;t really function and work after smoking.
2. I work in a somewhat professional occupation and drug testing is only random, but would occur after any accident. A positive result either case would get you fired.
3. To older, old school folks like me, it&#39;s kind of like day drinking. You just don&#39;t really drive or work when you&#39;re impaired from drinking or smoking.
4. Now that I&#39;m older I look at it as similar to cigarette smoking. It&#39;s just not good for you to smoke anything. It&#39;s definitely not healthy. Although it&#39;s probably a lot better than cigarette smoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it depends on the demographic of who is looking down on cannabis... I&#39;ve grown and bred cannabis since I was 14, since the glut of overproduction and the way business is run I&#39;ve stepped away and just grow for myself- it did cause a craze for me that eventually turned me into a state certified horticulturist, one of the most respected in Cambridge mass, people compare the herb I was growing to &quot;the crazy stuff out of Amherst in the 90&#39;s&quot;  I&#39;ve lived through the days of northern lights Aks and hazes to the Kush and Sour era of the early 00&#39;s to the often disappointing MACs and GMOs of nowadays, ill leave it on the shelf man..</p>

<p>The reason society looks down on it is the psyop program from anslinger on- pre DEA, cannabis was used in the states as more of a textile and natural resource for oil, then as the smoking and integration of people started, the racism reared its ugly head. you see, jazz clubs were getting popular and it&#39;s unclear who thought to smoke cannabis flower, but tobacco was being smoked regularly and cultivated for such, certain  jazz clubs were a hot spot for smoked cannabis in the 30&#39;s. The counter culture is the true fear propelled by the government.</p>

<p>We must realize, cannabis allows people to be much more understanding and open to one another&#39;s ideas and positions by allowing ourselves a new prospective into it that is lent by a cannabis high. Think in a pre MLK world where if you were white you were looked down on by your peers for hanging with the blacks.. this is literally the root of perception for &quot;looking down&quot; on cannabis users. it was the early integration with cannabis as being a lead perpetuator, to be comfortable hanging out with people that are nothing like yourself only to discover you are more alike than you first thought. the fear and divisiveness that propels governmental propaganda is torn apart by the seams of conscious construct.</p>

<p>you must realize when it comes to science, every scientist that is beyond institutional study has either joined a private sector that is ingrained with the government or are a government contractor themself (if you are doing anything worthwhile in terms of technological advancement). When cannabis was studied by medical professionals (even some with heavy bias) they usually end up with positive results, there is even history of results being sealed from the public or altered to reflect a negative impact of cannabis yet the government has a patent on cannabinoids being a neuro-protectant, how could this be?</p>

<p>it circles back to government control, the counter culture that is so widely based and diverse the federal government can not put cannabis users in a box which is probably worrisome, and of course the veil lifted by propaganda, in a similar way to shrooms the connections being made in the brain are new and connect parts that usually do not &#39;communicate&#39;  this bridge with the subconscious mind is something largely unexplored- I recall a few years ago seeing psychologists studies on the shrinking of the frontal lobe accompanied with a heavy increase of gray matter in the brain of heavy cannabis users. </p>

<p>MK-ultra was a real study from the CIA to search for a mind control/truth serum. Many different substances went through vigorous testing for their psychological effects from the viewpoint of extracting information. This had to be the nail in the coffin for the government perception of cannabis as a threat... we like to say, oh how dangerous could cannabis be, Doritos and couch potatoes- this is why the business of indicas are booming because the government has no qualms with a plant that makes you lazy- but what about that cannabis that makes you nervous and anxious, you can&#39;t stand still lol what about cannabis Sativa? I can picture a soldier being interrogated while high and asking questions, lightheartedly- making the interviewer feel insecure in what they actually know, instead of being fed any information there might&#39;ve been the reverse- dangerous to a government that prefers dividing and sweeping any flaws and poorly perceived public views under the rug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither pro nor anti weed, I&#39;ll just add my experience here (which is obviously only anecdotal, but many solid studies have been posted above, by Friedrich_Ux for example)</p>

<p>I tried some low doses of weed some years ago and various doses of HHC when HHC used to be legal in my country. (10 to 25 mg of HHC, oral way)</p>

<p>It was...meh...each time it was a bit of fun (appreciation of taste, music...but it  lowered my capacity to analyse music. Sex was kinda weird but not bad taking HHC), but it also caused anxiety, slight dissociation, laziness, dry eyes and mouth, bad sleep...I&#39;d say each time, the experience was not extremely pleasant for me and was clearly anti-cognitive.</p>

<p>For sleep, CBD+CBN oil (no THC) is not too bad, quite well rounded, bit there are many more interesting and more specialized compounds on the market. (You will be better served by Melatonin + Carnosic Acid, I think)</p>

<p>It lay be interesting for a recreational use for people who tolerate it well (it must be or it would not be so common), but as far as I am concerned, there are tons of more reliable Nootropics, for anxiety (many racetams, Selank, Bromantane, Rhodiola if you don&#39;t use synthetics) , logical thinking (Noopept, Tak-653) or for sensory enhancement (Neboglamine)...your milage may vary (it most certainly will), but as far as I&#39;m concerned, it has no interest for pro-cognitive effect and for anti anxiety, there are so many compounds which will do the job in a much more selective way and with much less side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably a few things. I live in the USA and while we&#39;re not a monolith, we&#39;re a country built upon strict religious values among many other things. So I&#39;ll give a few perspectives from here.</p>

<p>Usually people smoke it and we know smoking is pretty bad for people. </p>

<p>Stoners don&#39;t get the most glamorous rep. People look at people who do it too much as the types who have smoked themselves stupid. And those who do it because it&#39;s legal may think it&#39;s safe, so they&#39;ll smoke while doing shit like driving or at work. Or they may be able to function on it or not give a shit, then just do it all the time regardless of consequence to others.</p>

<p>In the USA, we understand now it was banned for reasons outside of its effects. But that part of the culture of, &quot;it&#39;s a drug, drugs are bad&quot; is still a part of the world.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the capitalist part of the USA that&#39;s dangerous. It&#39;s that people will market and sell it to anyone to get high. &quot;Feel things better.&quot; &quot;Live life better.&quot; &quot;Fix depression and anxiety.&quot; Some term like that. And that&#39;s not the experience for everyone for every strain and so on. It&#39;s selling a drug to people. Have them buy it and use it regularly, regardless of its effects, to pretend that it fulfills a need that it doesn&#39;t. For some it may help. For others, it may give the illusion of helping when really it&#39;s selling.</p>

<p>Not everyone does great on weed or has the same effects. Some people may find pain relief. I have met a few people with eating problems who sometimes have to hit their CBD vape just to eat. Others may find paranoia. As my psychology professor put it, &quot;it just makes you lazy.&quot; A buddy of mine put it best. &quot;I smoked so much weed for a year and then saw I got nothing done, so I stopped.&quot; It&#39;s not some miracle cure-all or life enhancer that people would like to make it out to be. It can be those things. But it&#39;s not the fix. And for people looking to reduce anxiety, it&#39;s a bit of treating the symptoms vs getting to the root of the problems. And it may be in conjunction with things like CBT, meditation/mindfulness, or other therapies to help.</p>

<p>Also, we live in a fairly puritanical society in the USA. &quot;It&#39;s better than alcohol&quot; is met sometimes with &quot;doesn&#39;t make it better.&quot; A lot of society here still looks at imbibing, especially the ascetic religious followers, as morally inappropriate.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s illegal, so many will follow the law and even believe the lawful rule is there for a moral reason. So people will see it still as drugs are bad.</p>

<p>Many will look at psychoactive drugs as a way to open experiences, when for many things like mindfulness, meditation, may be able to offer other ways to achieve an openness that&#39;s desired through it. It&#39;s like many will use any physical substance to achieve a goal that can be achieved without. Like people needing alcohol to have fun or be loose when one can lower their own inhibitions without it.</p>

<p>Just different perspectives on it all. Doesn&#39;t invalidate your experiences and you may feel yours are valid. There are plenty of people who will agree and plenty who won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly understand how one could easily accept the &quot;pitfalls&quot; of THC/CBD usage. I found out pretty quickly that it helped me fall asleep (buzzed my body up so that I could relax without a racing mind). Later, it became my source of dopamine for when I didn&#39;t need to do anything for 12 hours (would wake up feeling drowsy up to 12 hours after smoking). I was not in a good headspace, and my environment (work and home) did not help me see the positives.</p>

<p>Eventually, I started experiencing the paranoia many people mention they start getting in their late 20&#39;s (I&#39;m 28). I also was in the middle of some spiritual awakening processes, so I started paying attention during my highs, identifying &quot;negative&quot; thoughts. During my sober time, I had also decided THC was great for helping me focus on meditating (though the sluggish brain sometimes distracted me from a string of thoughts), and I learned how to alchemize my fears/negative thoughts into positive ones that still kept the intentions (for example, I did not think I would be a great pet owner, and someone had come up with an observation that was equal and opposite to my statement). So when I noticed paranoid thoughts pop up, I would practice flipping the script.</p>

<p>Eventually, my spiritual awakening in my mind sped up as I started experiencing thought patterns similar to bi-polar manic (paranoia+pronoia). I kept following what felt good (epiphanies and revelations that caused my chest to feel lighter everytime I &quot;made a new connection&quot;). One night, I had even thought I meshed consciousnesses with one of my friends who lives 2 hours away. I played it out, but definitely felt very disoriented afterwards. My other friends were concerned, of course, because it looked a lot like a schizophrenic episode, yet, I knew it was all in my head, for I was paying attention to it the entire time, trying to use thought-alchemy to get out of it.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I got my wisdom teeth taken out, so I was off the THC/CBD vape for a while. I started up again after 2 weeks from the removal. My head would still swarm with thoughts that I considered to be spiritual, analyzing shows I would watch while high to learn more about my authentic self (especially if the universe is a reflection of my perception). By then, I had decided I&#39;d only use THC to induce dreams (on/off routine), recreationally if I had All of my needs and sober wants done, and for meditation to remove any creative blocks I&#39;m not aware of.</p>

<p>I feel functionally fine. Almost back to normal (memory isnt back yet, but thats because the relevance hasnt built up yet, am in transition). There&#39;s many many other factors that could explain what happened to me, but I am satisfied with how that journey went for me. Since then, I&#39;ve been listening to other spiritual-awakening videos, collecting more puzzle pieces to decide on, playing chess with my resources, and have sought out other creative ways to connect with myself like using astrology houses to organize my yearly goals, tarot for sub-conscious thought provocation, the Human Design chart for how I want to respond to life, and am looking into bone-throwing for non-serious yes/no questions about my life for things that I don&#39;t think will matter.</p>

<p>I controlled a lot of my life and oppressed myself, and I feel the most whole I&#39;ve felt in my life. I grew up Christian Lutheran/Non-denominational, and my whole life I just wanted to meet God. As far as my left brain goes, I have. He and I were one and the same the whole time, but I didn&#39;t realize it because everyone else made Him sound like some &quot;other&quot; that I had no say in how my life was suppose to go. Now I realize that all beliefs come from God (via the mathematical transitive property: if [religion](specifically spirituality, which is different) comes from man, and man comes from Source/God/OTP, then ALL spiritual beliefs are from God). </p>

<p>Everything has a purpose, and most people don&#39;t realize they have the power to assign a specific purpose (boundary) for tools like money, drugs, etc. So I can see and understand how easily one could have negative experiences or end up &quot;settling&quot; in their life (though I also recognize some people truly do not want to chase their higher goals because stability and comfortability are still needed in their life). </p>

<p>So to answer your question with what I know now, people look down on weed because they believe the stigmas and stereotypes over their own experiences, and it&#39;s not just limited to weed and drugs. Anytime someone feels trapped or stuck, I think there&#39;s a possibility they have the veil of disbelief preventing them from crossing over into whatever it is they truly want. Things change over time and adapt, including the old lessons people have collected over the years. People also just see the &quot;cost&quot; of using weed (natural consequences from chemical reactions) and are unwilling to shift around their resources to accommodate for it, and that is valid as well because sometimes people just have responsibilities that are not as flexible as those with less responsibilities. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re up for being the pioneer, I believe in you. I think it would be a great idea to integrate marijuana into holistic healing, because as I understand holisticism, they&#39;re very into natural forms of health maintenance, and marijuana is a natural plant.</p>

Can y&#39;all please not perpetuate the myth that weed makes you lazy?
A poor relationship with any dopamine-inducing activity is what makes people lazy. You can develop the same pattern with food or entertainment.</p>

<p>Why is weed looked down upon?
Imo it&#39;s cultural. The rich don&#39;t smoke weed, they sniff coke and pop pills. Weed is &#39;beneath&#39; them.
I believe many of the &#39;lazy&#39; connotations around weed stem from that.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, who cares what other people think. Be discreet, don‚Äôt tell anybody you smoke, always carry mouthwash, gum, and cologne. Nobody can tell you just took a puff, and if they can then they really don‚Äôt give a shit.</p>

<p>Weed mayby is not directly. </p>

<p>But at least best functioning drug rehabitilation centre leader considered that most difficult form of addiction from treatment perspective is mixed usage of cannabis and alcohol. With heroin addicts it is very easy to tell &quot;your life is shit, you will change your hometown, you will never ever see any of your so called friends and so on..&quot; - and it works because users accept and admit all of that. </p>

<p>With booze &amp; weed mixed cycle user never considers to have any real problem - it was just one of many drinking binges what were to be holiday out of permanent state of stonedness that went just out of hand... and then another again.. and another again...</p>

<p>Problem that with heavy drugs or decent booze you can work out yourself down the drains in just one week, so then you get something about your state and act accordingly, but with weed it is many years process when problems out of that starts to emerge in way that they cannot be denied anymore, and then it is too late or very very long time to reverse all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that it isn‚Äôt just their own time when people walk around smoking it publically and exposing others to it who don‚Äôt want to be exposed to it. It is physcially addictive and there are studies to prove it. There is even a medication to help addicted people wean off of it. But people are so obsessed with it that they can‚Äôt respect the space of others (by not using it privately where it doens‚Äôt effect others) and they refuse to believe the literal evidence that it is harmful and addictive. Some people are so addicted that they even continue to use it while pregnant, in the presence of pregnant women and in the presence of children whose brains are still developing. </p>

<p>Its one thing to use certain strains of cannabis in a theraputic setting, like the work being done with the Somatic Physchedellic Institute. Its a completely different thing to chronically use and abuse it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say the distain is because the population that are chronic users are very similar to the population of tobacco smokers, except the cannabis users somehow think they‚Äôre better than tobacco users.</p>

The isolated compounds are more predictable, that being said having them work in tandem is where its really at, but most weed at this point has been grown to be insanely strong which I think ruins the plant because your tolerance will always adjust to whatever strength you have.

    <div class="md"><p>Part of it is marketing/societal brainwashing. Part of it because in truth a lot of people who spend all day smoking are idiots.</p>

<p>I am a user but my ex fiance used to be a heavy one too. Every time he got high something somewhat dangerous would always happen. Usually broken glasses or leaving the oven open, while it‚Äôs on, etc. Then one week I had to travel for work. While I was gone, he decided to give my dog a bath in the tub to surprise me with a clean little furdude when I got home. Well when I got home, my dog was ‚Äúbathed‚Äù. He was still slick with shampoo and conditioner that wasn‚Äôt rinsed off, and his skin was bright red‚Äî had to take him to the vet immediately because he was having a skin reaction the the products being on his skin for so long. The floor was soaked all through the hallway and to the front door, because in the process my ex also forgot to turn the tub off. He also couldn‚Äôt keep a job and hopped between five in the span of a year because he was always high and forgetful.</p>

<p>Weed just isn‚Äôt for everyone‚Äôs brain. And the bad examples stand out the most. We don‚Äôt see the dentists and doctors who smoke. I was so physically incapacitated by my illness before weed‚Äî I had to quit school, quit my job, basically quit my life because I couldn‚Äôt even sit in bed and watch TV without being in excruciating pain. Now after weed I‚Äôm finishing up my bachelors and about to apply for masters programs immediately after. And back to work of course. I get to enjoy all my hobbies and have a fun, colorful life again without pain. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm pretty open about using weed, but a lot of people who use weed and have positive responses or zero negative life effects simply aren‚Äôt loud about it. In public most of the examples of users we see are the people who take foreverrrrrr in line to order food and then talk and laugh during movies. That being said, if you can stand to not inconvenience others I do encourage smoking before watching a movie. One time I got super super stoned before watching the movie Detroit, thinking I was going in to see a musical because I didn‚Äôt read up on the movie. Let me tell you, my friends and I left with TRAUMA üòÇ</p>

And now with edibles and everything else, you dont even have to put your lungs at risk by smoking it. Ive known alcoholics, meth heads, coke heads, heroin addicts, and every other kind of user. All those things can and will ruin your life if it gets out of control and it often does. They can even kill you. Ive never heard of weed ruining someones life. If anyone is letting weed affect their life, then they have deeper issues they need to work on and quitting weed should be the first step.

    <div class="md"><p>I started smoking 20 years ago with some low potency stuff back in the day. I miss it tbh. We could smoke and smoke and gradually get blazed or stop for a nice mild effect. Nowadays everything is SO strong, after one hit, you‚Äôre there. Maybe two hits, but it‚Äôs too much. 
Bc I love cannabis, I easily can start back on a daily habit if I don‚Äôt watch it. 
The side effects come for me strong if I‚Äôve been smoking daily tho! The munchies are the worst, I almost can‚Äôt turn them off. For pain, initially (just like productivity) it helps but with EVERYDAY use FOR ME, it increases my pain levels and I suspect it‚Äôs increasing inflammation. After I detox at least 4 days, bloating goes down &amp; pain goes back down. Now this could be related to those late night munchies as I don‚Äôt snack late normally. I find contradicting studies on if it reduces or increases inflammation so it‚Äôs hard to know for sure. 
For my anxiety on a daily basis, I have to stick to using Magnesium. I like Magnesium Breakthrough  as it‚Äôs got a little bit of 7 different forms of Mg. It‚Äôs perfect for my stress during the day and I take a larger dose to help me sleep. 
I won‚Äôt abandon cannabis completely, but I do have lots of memory issues when I use it daily. 
For me, it‚Äôs my weekend ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù. If I use it ONCE a week, I get stoned every time easily. I don‚Äôt find that it will interfere in productivity and little to no memory effects. 
<em>**I personally never smoke before any type of work situation. I feel like I‚Äôm trying to cheat my employer if I do that. I also can‚Äôt talk to people as relaxed as I am sober so it‚Äôs a no-go to mix work with weed. I work with sharp objects also I have to be FULLY AWARE of everything I‚Äôm doing at all times. *</em>*
Now when I use it weekly, I feel inspired &amp; productive every time. If it becomes a daily habit, it reverses and I get the ‚Äúfuck its‚Äù easily. I don‚Äôt drink often at all. Last year I had maybe ten drinks total. I love my vices but not more than I love myself and I have to remind myself of this as this entire post is almost triggering me now. 
I don‚Äôt know if any of that is useful/helpful but that‚Äôs my experience. I have to have a balanced life and not feel deprived or I can to overcompensate in other areas. I‚Äôm not saying smoking once weekly is good for anyone else, but that is what works for me at this time in my life. ü´∂üèª</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ive gotten toasty on the daily since 2018, i love marijuana not gonna lie, its helped me a lot, and very little is negative for me‚Ä¶i really only vape, and i am was a cigarette smoker from 13 to 36 years old‚Ä¶i can promise you the little marijuana vapes are waaay less toxic to you than inhaling the burnt flower from a pipe and for sure less toxic than cigarette smoke inhalation. I will never understand why alcohol is so acceptable in our culture..it has hurt mankind much more than its helped them. Drunk driving, crime, fighting, cirrhosis, you name it‚Ä¶but say its taboo to feel good, a little hungry, very receptive to outside stimuli, and maybe get a lottle sleepy. I made over $200K last two years‚Ä¶it makes some lazy but not everybody. It has bonded my wife and i. I stopped drinking in 2017 because it was hurting my life. At the end of the day..the people that believe alcohol&gt;marijuana will die off because most are older who think this way. The statistics of marijuana acceptance by the public has skyrocketed the last decade‚Ä¶</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though people don&#39;t realize that weed ruins people&#39;s lives not by killing them but by taking away their motivations and their aspirations and various aspects of their cognition. </p>

<p>But alcohol is way more obvious because someone could get drunk and hurt someone or kill someone while driving right? Let&#39;s make the death comparison so weed doesn&#39;t look as bad. </p>

<p>Sorry but most people who try it only try it to their negative detriment, and the fact that more people are trying it these days especially younger people is really bad. But only time and statistics will tell oh well. Maybe another example could be not brushing your teeth or not getting exercise those things are bad but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s going to kill you and be a tragedy but it does take away from your life in considerable ways that you don&#39;t realize until it&#39;s too late</p>
