        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have been using bromantane nasal spray on and off for the last couple of months and I can say without a doubt that I have noticed beneficial effects from this substance. </p>

<p>*Improved motivation in the sense of everything I do I enjoy it more or are motivated once I start doing basically anything in my usual day.</p>

<p>*Energy levels have increased and this basically has became my &quot;coffee&quot; in the morning to start off my day and works wonders even on off days that I do not get as much sleep in the night.</p>

<p>*Increase in focus once I start and activity</p>

<p>*Increased mood that lasts the duration of the dose</p>

<p>*Increased memory/cognitive function in the way that my brain feels like it has switched to a mode to retain the information better because I am enjoying the action of learning and am motivated.</p>

<p>Now to one of my main questions of this post. </p>

<p>I was born with one kidney and I have been trying to maintain and improve my kidney function through suppliments. </p>

<p>I have heard that bromantane and bemethyl hbr are very beneficial for your cognitive health but the thing that stuck me as significant was the kidney benefits.</p>

<p>I am wondering if using bromantane intranasally would still reap the benefits on the kidneys?</p>

<p>I have recently just ordered a powder form just to experiment with different routes to see what is the most beneficial for me, but I&#39;m just curious on if that would still work.</p>

<p>I also have an order of bemethyl hbr because of the possible kidney and hypoxic benefits. I am trying to find something that could help with my sleep apnea and the damage that comes from the low oxygen levels at night as well as just improving kidney function.</p>

<p>I would love to hear other peoples experiences with both substances and input!</p>
