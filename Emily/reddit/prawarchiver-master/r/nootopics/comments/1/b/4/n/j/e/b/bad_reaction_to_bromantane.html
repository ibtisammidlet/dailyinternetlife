        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So today my gf took about 100mg of oral bromantane (she didn&#39;t like the idea of 30min sublingual option)</p>

<p>Within first hour she got: </p>

<ul>
<li>Brain fog </li>
<li>Fatigue </li>
<li>Instead of discipline / motivation She play games the whole day and don&#39;t have any willpower to get work done which wasn&#39;t a problem the day before </li>
</ul>

<p>What is going on? What can we do about it? 
In ex. When I take bromantane even 100-200mg I feel amazing, almost manic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™ve done intranasal (from Everychem) and oral (from Umbrella Labs). I found intranasal to be more effective, and I can def vouch for Everychem. Iâ€™ve gone through 4 bottles from them. Iâ€™ll be switching back to them when I finish the powder from UL.</p>

<p>The intranasal is a little drippy so I typically applied it with my head tilted back, and then chilled in that position for couple mins. I also kept a Kleenex with me for a short while after to dab my upper lip if any dripped out.</p>

<p>100mg was a large dose for a first time user, and just in general as a single dose. Smaller dose a couple times a day is better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she played games the whole day she might&#39;ve actually had raised dopamine. <strong>One of the effects of slight dopamine enhancement is also increased sedation as seen in people treated for adhd</strong></p>

<p>This last part is especially true if she is sleep deprived. Eg, didn&#39;t sleep well last night or slept too less in a way that build up. Stimulants can make people with adhd have a better focus, aka react more adequately. This can be felt as an enhanced sensitivity to your emotional/energy states, which thus seemingly paradoxially seems to sedate us. People with adhd often feel tired but not sleepy, maybe even agitated. On treatment tiredness can suddenly be felt as sleepyness/sedation</p>

<p>In other words, maybe she needed some rest</p>

<p>I kinda see where youâ€™re going with thatâ€¦I find nicotine way more relaxing than stimulating, although I havenâ€™t studied why </p>
