    <div class="md"><p>Many people actually have gotten anhedonia from BPC-157. We do not know why, and the oral form has more reports but the subQ can too. It seems like people who are on any psych drugs or have been on psych drugs recently also more susceptible due to some weird interactions. But people on nothing have also gotten the issue</p>

<p>For anhedonia, theres better stuff than BPC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Injected BPC-157 acetate didnt cause any issues for me, oral arginine salt caused long lasting anhedonia for me. BPC-157 is not great for anhedonia at all, not sure where this idea came from. Bromantane, MIF-1 and 9-Me-BC are most effective for that ime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ever do it, do tiny amounts to test what happens. Some people have taken single normal doses and have never been the same again.</p>

<p>I regret not taking a tiny dose because it messed up two weeks for me by inducing anhedonia. </p>

<p>If you look online there are at least five people that claim this and there&#39;s also apparently a Facebook group where there&#39;s a bunch of people in there that have had permanent effects. </p>

<p>It does something with the brain gut connection and since we know there&#39;s a lot of neurotransmitters in the gut it&#39;s playing with a lot of things we have no idea about, not a nootropic at all by any means. So if you are going to try it start tiny. Wait a day. Do a little more. Not worth it.</p>

<p>Also you can just look up bpc anhedonia and you will find posts where it has caused it for some people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not hard. Use the same needle to draw and to pin, 29 or 30 gauge (smaller is a better and more painful but faster needle). Use a alcohol pad to wipe before and after the location. </p>

<p>125 I think is too much, some people did 150 and were screwed. Try 50. Lowest you can go and wait a while. There&#39;s a high chance it won&#39;t affect you but this is a very special thing where it can completely change the way your gut brain connection functions and it can really screw you.</p>

<p>Also I personally use easy touch .3ml 1/2&quot; syringes because they were the cheapest and right kind off of Amazon. </p>

<p>You dont need anything larger than .3ml for peptides and 1/2&quot; needle length is good enough, you could even do 5/16&quot; is you wanted to. Good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I watched some videos too, and yeah doesn’t seem too complicated. Some recommended to switch the needle for a new one after drawing from vial, but I don’t think that is necessary, as you mentioned.</p>

<p>But wait: do you buy needles and syringe separately? I was thinking of just going to pharmacy and asking for syringe with needle (like for insulin). More convenient than buying online.</p>

<p>And thank you for this information; I didn’t know all this about different gauges and needle lengths. I think 1ml syringe should be enough, with 29 gauge and 1/2” needle like you suggest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think 1ml is too much. .3cc is 30% of ml. Unless you plan to inject something else in the future but if you don&#39;t try and get the smaller ones. Yeah maybe your Pharmacy is the best option, hopefully they don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing other drugs lol</p>

<p>The ones I buy the needle and the syringe come together and you just have to take the Caps off to use it. I don&#39;t know much about putting a needle on a syringe</p>

Fairly easy, just if you do it with those types of syringes OP, please please please make sure you buy ones MEANT for injection.
