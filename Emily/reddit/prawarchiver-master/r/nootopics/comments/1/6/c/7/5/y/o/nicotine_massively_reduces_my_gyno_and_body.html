        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all, wanted to share something interesting that I’ve noticed myself with Nicotine. The only “drug” I usually consume is caffeine. I also take some basics like Magnesium, D3, Glycine, etc. every day. I also exercise vigorously daily.</p>

<p>I usually have some mild gyno ever since I hit puberty. I have no clue why, but it’s always been harmless besides the slight puffiness ess. It doesn’t itch or anything like that. I also have noticed though that I appear to hold some extra water weight. All of these signs suggest elevated estrogen.</p>

<p>I’ve always enjoyed some nicotine here and there recreationally. I love cigars. I’ll have one maybe every month or so. However, a few weeks ago I decided to pick up some 2mg lozenges  to see how that’d affect me “nootropic” wise after reading some posts on it.</p>

<p>I’ve just been popping one every morning after I get to work, and I noticed that after the first day my gyno seemed to disappear almost entirely! I also noticed that although I felt hungrier and started eating a bit more, I seem to look more defined as well, like some extra fluff  (water weight?) dropped off my body. Premature ejaculation also improves noticeable. Nothing crazy but still there. </p>

<p>I don’t know if this has to do with the dopamine release triggered by the nACh receptors agonism but it very well could be. I’ve also seen studies showing that Nicotine is an AI in the brain: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904480/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2904480/</a>
Nothing else I’ve ever tried has done anything like this. </p>

<p>The slight gyno seems to come back after a day or two of not having any nicotine and the body fluffiness also comes back. Something also worth noting is that the Nicotine doesn’t feel addicting whatsoever. Sure it’s a nice little buzz for a little bit, but I have no hard time at all not hinking about taking more throughout the day. Also, during the periods where I didn’t take any to test this effect I had an easy time just going about my day as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has a lot of components.</p>

<p>Poor posture can entrap nerve communication down the spine , leading to more nervous output to maintain nerve conduction homeostasis. E.g some forms of scoliosis can lead to it.</p>

<p>Also, a weak pelvic floor along with a weak trunk. This one is more important.</p>

<p>Serotonin calms the spinal column hence it reduces conduction and prolongs. </p>

<p>I use dapoxetine (or GHB)
Works very well. I made an injectable one so it works within 5 min.</p>

<p>I would SubQ 5mg and that would be more than enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am against SSRI, I publicly inform people of its dangers.</p>

<p>Dapoxetine is not a problem, it works in a very peculiar way. And to get withdrawal based on its properties, you need to take it 5 -8 times a day to maintain serum concentration and continue for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Which is not how anyone uses dapoxetine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you’re figuring it out, but if you’re having gyno and other issues, your body is producing too much estrogen/estriadol/prolactin. This is a common problem for bodybuilders who get into performance enhancing drugs, especially people who are “super aromatizers” or whose body converts testosterone into estrogen at a higher rate. </p>

<p>There are many ways to curve off this problem, from supplements like methyl folate, to more serious ones like aromasin which reduces/stops testosterone from turning into estrogen. </p>

<p>You need to be careful with those because you can “crash” your estrogen, which is bad- you need some estrogen to function normally so you need to find a level that reduces but doesn’t stop it.</p>
