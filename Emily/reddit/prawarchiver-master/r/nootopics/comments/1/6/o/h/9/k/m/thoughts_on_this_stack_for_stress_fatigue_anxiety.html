        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I bought these noots knowing they have good reviews, but the selegiline and bromantane was likely inspired by sirsadalot and this sub and I like to give credit where credit is due. </p>

<p>Morning:</p>

<p>Bromantane 14mg sublingual</p>

<p>Selegiline 2.5mg sublingual</p>

<p>ALCAR 400mg</p>

<p>Agmatine 800mg</p>

<p>50mg NALC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine-ethyl-ester)</p>

<p>1-3 bags of tea (usually mint or saffron green tea, or black/earl grey. Matcha or yerba mate if I have the time and energy.) </p>

<p>Vitamin D 2000ug (prescribed, deficient) </p>

<p>CBD vape (broad spec, under 0.2% THC but very celebral and mood-lifting) </p>

<p>400mg alpha-GPC</p>

<hr/>

<p>Night (this combo makes me pretty groggy in the morning but it works):</p>

<p>Melatonin 2-3mg (sublingual oil and oral) </p>

<p>CBN 15mg + CBD 15mg (sublingual oil) </p>

<p>Atarax 25mg (Antihistamine/allergy medicine, prescribed off-label for insomnia/anxiety) </p>

<p>Oleamide 220mg</p>

<p>Tetrohydropalmatine 29mg</p>

<p>Vit C 40mg (part of liftmode sleep caps) </p>

<p>This is pretty much everything for my daily or near-daily stack. </p>

<p>Might just replace my NALC with NAC after a while but so far I&#39;m really liking it for addiction and mood stability so I might just keep using NALC knowing this one works for me. </p>

<p>I also have a daily cannabis habit mostly in the evenings, I am cutting down with dry-herb vapes and CBD, knowing that a daily high-THC habit is disruptive for the long term even though it helps my stress, anxiety and depression issues. </p>

<p>Daily nicotine vaping habit, from snus to vaping and been addicted to nicotine for too long but it feels like a smaller vice than daily cannabis use so I&#39;m just observing the habit right now, may reduce nicotine in my homemade juices over time. </p>

<p>I also have lots of piracetam, noopept and a sample of sunifiram that I intend to use more sporadically when I feel like having small cognitive boost. (these powders last me forever though, usually tea is enough.) </p>

<p>I also use l-theanine weekly for anxiety, caffeine jitters or relaxing teas. Also phenibut for days I know will be really difficult, but I try to use it as sparingly as possible and I&#39;m against using it as a necessary crutch for difficult things in life unless it&#39;s a daily habit. I use it 0 to 3 times per week, one 290 mg scoop or one more depending on the day.</p>

<p>I want to get into more herbs and supplements but right now I don&#39;t think I want to complicate my stack any more than this, unless there&#39;s something plain neuroprotective with a very low chance of negative interactions. </p>

<p>And sorry for bad formatting, I&#39;m on mobile and it&#39;s gets harder if you don&#39;t know the BB code.</p>

<p>Edit: formatting, wording, added agmatine 800mg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any thought on ISRIB for this stack? Not sure if I&#39;m adding another synthetic compound, much less an experimental one. But it sounds like it might be good candidate for stress, memory and neuroprotective effects. </p>

<p>Definitely need to research everything I can about it and gain an understanding of why one might prefer it in a stack like mine before I even begin considering being an early candidate 🤔. But it sounds very good on paper, unless I need to go for the injection route (sublingual or liquid IN only).</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s as far as I&#39;ll go with nootropics and ISRIB is a little bit outside of my comfort zone, but it&#39;s definitely in the realm of what I&#39;m seeking. It&#39;s surprisingly common in Europe like other unusual experimental nootropics from our post-soviet neighbors, as well as Russia and China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a big one. You might want to just look into some of the adaptogens, rhodiola rosea has a good track record for reducing stress and fatigue.</p>

<p>Edit: also long term antihistamine use is bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely considering an adeptogen smoothie, I have a recipe I&#39;m working on (primarily rhodiola rosea, Korean ginseng and saffron which are the adaptogens I react best to), including oils and fibers, black pepper, frozen spinage, hemp oil, CBG, CBD, quercetin and more. </p>

<p>Really wanna fully embrace the adaptogen hype train, so far it hasn&#39;t been as impressive as nootropics but I&#39;m going slowly in like with all my supps. </p>

<p>I know antihistamines are pretty bad, definitely nitoced it when I was on seroquel off-label for sleep and anxiety. Mirtazapine was also too much for me, too tired and fatigued all the time when I was on either one. </p>

<p>But benzos, gabapentinoids and z-drugs are the only other ones that have worked reliably and long-term, I have an addictive personality and doctors are too afraid to prescribe, so this is the least antihistaminic combo that I have come up so far that is reliable, the combo is not hard on energy and cognitive performance when I need to be fully functional.</p>

<p>Definitely dropping the antihistamines when my overall health improves and I&#39;m more stable and functional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I read some negatives on Quercetin, might want to just have a read around about that. The adaptogens I think are more to help background stuff, not necessarily all that noticeable but can produce a meaningful difference over time.</p>

<p>Good to hear you&#39;re aware of the danger of antihistamines, lots of doctors give them out willy nilly and don&#39;t properly inform patients. AFAIK most also affect the cholinergic system. Insomnia is a bitch, I hope you find a better treatment that works for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ve probably given my cholinergic system a run for its money in terms of memory, never had a seizure though or anything like those horror stories from seroquel treatment, maybe because I pretty much never accept more than one dose increase so I think I&#39;ve made the right choice. </p>

<p>I think antihistamines should be considered as last resort meds like benzodiazepines to be honest, scary stuff. It&#39;s overused in Norwegian psychiatry and others I&#39;ve met can attest to this. </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read, quercetin sounds like one of those ingredients typically used to boost adaptogen mixes or other herbal medicine mixes. I think it&#39;s worth getting deeper into, but yeah definitely gonna treat it with respect. 👍</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And regarding your stack:</p>

<p>Cut the melatonin dose by 10. Works better.</p>

<p>Switch ROA of bromantane to IN.</p>

<p>Drop selegiline if you have sleep issues...lol, and maybe don&#39;t take ALCAR every day since it has quite the half life and disturbs sleep for a lot of people.</p>

<p>Anticholinergic antihistamines are not great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bupropion is my antidepressant of choice and almost fixed my depression for a long time, but it&#39;s not working anymore. I also used phenibut for more difficult days and both helped me make a lot of progress with myself, but it wasn&#39;t sustainable enough. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t have any noticeable side effects from them, but the combo hasn&#39;t been good for my memory in retrospect, especially with cannabis and antihistamines. </p>

<p>NDRIs the only class of ADs that have worked for me and it only amounts to bupropion for me, so I am exploring other options by using low dose selegiline and bromantane for this, definitely subtle but so was bupropion and I&#39;m excited to see what it will do for the long term while I&#39;m working on myself and my professional life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was considering making a dropper bottle with noopept for intranasal, maybe I&#39;ll make a two-in-one with bromantane. Easy to get antibacterial water, I don&#39;t innsuflate the powders anymore but I&#39;m considering this. </p>

<p>Hmm.. Now it sounds like a good way to kickstart brain when I wake up 😅. Hopefully it won&#39;t make it addictive and a decent euphoriant, but probably not?</p>

<p>My CBN oil contains melatonin and so does my liftmode sleep caps so I can&#39;t dose my melatonin any lower, but I&#39;ll be switching to the individual powders from liftmode after my caps are out to reduce the melatonin. Thanks for the tip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the idea is nice, it won&#39;t work sadly. Noopept needs to be dissolved in propylene glycol or DMSO and the best choice for bromantane is caprylic acid. Why not just get the spray and dropper solutions from everychem? </p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be addictive, but if that&#39;s something you struggle with you could get neboglamine from EC as well.</p>

<p>Agmatine is a cheap and effective option for addiction and depression also (as long as your gut and stomach aren&#39;t too sensitive)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neboglamine sounds great. Although I will be affecting my glutamate receptors with NALC, phenibut, agmatine, selegiline too IIRC. I had pretty strong warnings from a specialist about experimenting with my glutamate system, therefore I&#39;m really careful in that department.</p>

<p>Although all of these have been found to have neuroprotective effects so it sounds pretty amazing on paper. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna read some more about it and gain a broader understanding of the glutamate system. 👍</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, it was the N-acetyl-cysteine variant (zion pharma/aniracetam.eu) 🙏. I know it&#39;s a variant of nac and used it before for phlegm, just my mind being goofy. N-acetyl-l-cysteine-ethyl-ester. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, at the moment it has net positive benefits because of the lack of insomnia and it hasn&#39;t been as as nearly hard as seroquel or mirtazapine have been during the day, I will titrate down once I start using the powders individually instead of the sleep caps 👍.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a few brushes with more potent stimulants and this isn&#39;t it in that regard, I&#39;m on day 2 of selegiline. It&#39;s gonna get more potent, so I am definitely lowering the dose if it becomes a proper euphoriant or if I notice disassociation and delusion in any way. This form of stimulation is almost outside of my comfort zone, think I might lower the dose or just wait and see. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna squash that euphoria when I see it and do something about it, I&#39;ve been spared of stimulant abuse so far and I want to keep it that way. Only tried amphetamines in some rare moments of impulsivity with dissapointing effects, I don&#39;t really like that vibe but I can see why people like it. Those are probably powerful for me in therapeutic doses but I&#39;m not taking my chances. </p>

<p>Selegiline feels cleaner than bupropion and I&#39;m kind of worried about the long-term effects of the metabolites. To be really honest, what I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t normal at all in psychiatry in my country but low dose selegiline and weaker stimulants for depression also isn&#39;t (except for bupropion and maybe effexor counts).</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna be really careful because I am incredibly calm and concentrated, zero intrusive thoughts, no zoning out like I often do and no impulsivity towards non-productive activities so it&#39;s easier to control my habits, it&#39;s definitely working much better than I intended and I don&#39;t want to become someone else. </p>

<p>Might be placebo right now but might not be in a week. I notice how I write these long replies without any thought, usually I tend to overthink and throw a tl:dr at the bottom to feel less insecure about my engagement. </p>

<p>Not all too concerned though in the end, at this point I think schizophrenia and mania can&#39;t be unlocked so easily anymore, not with how I used psychedelics and ketamine in my early twenties, and my chronic cannabis use. But I know how drugs of abuse trigger psychotic symptoms and mania and I&#39;m trying to get my head around how to navigate this, with the knowledge that bupropion and low dose stimulants are the things that have worked at the core of my problems.</p>

<p>Edit: All my cannabis cravings are gone after selegiline on day 2 but I am going to bed so I went for some and I am back to normal again, I think I was somewhat overreacting because I simply wasn&#39;t being under much influence from cannabis and it does affect my mental capacity. I feel a little  embarrassed now. 😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sometimes works very well, I make an effort to meditate and practice breathwork but it&#39;s been hard to make them feel natural and if I have panic attacks it&#39;s best to vape or have a downer, thankfully it rarely ever happens so no RC anxiolytics or antipsychotics any longer. </p>
