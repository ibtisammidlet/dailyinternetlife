    <div class="md"><p>I guess it depends on your personal Bio chemistry. If your dopamine level is low, it will upregulate dopamine receptors and feel stimulating. If your dopamine level is already high the anxiolytic effects are more noticeable. Bromantane seems to be a unique modulator that keeps your brain chemistry in balance.</p>

<p>Bromantane isn&#39;t a chemical of balance my friend. Bromantane is a friend of our hypomanic mood states</p>

<p>Also the anxiolytic effects aren&#39;t so close related to its dopaminergic effects</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The presynaptic D2 receptor, a subtype of dopamine receptors, is primarily involved in regulating neurotransmitter release, especially dopamine. When activated by dopamine binding, the presynaptic D2 receptor can negatively modulate the release of dopamine from the presynaptic terminal. This autoregulatory mechanism helps maintain balanced dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft, preventing excessive dopamine release.</p>

<p>In terms of biochemistry, the activation of presynaptic D2 receptors leads to a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within the presynaptic neuron. This reduction in cAMP levels ultimately results in the inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. PKA is an enzyme that can phosphorylate proteins involved in neurotransmitter release, including proteins regulating vesicle fusion and exocytosis. By inhibiting PKA, the presynaptic D2 receptor dampens the signaling cascade that would otherwise enhance dopamine release, thus exerting a negative feedback control on neurotransmitter output.</p>

<p>The dysfunction of presynaptic D2 receptors has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding the biochemistry and function of these receptors is crucial for developing targeted treatments that can modulate dopamine release, thereby potentially mitigating the symptoms associated with these disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The D3 receptor, a subtype of dopamine receptors, is primarily found in regions of the brain associated with reward and emotion regulation. Its function is intricately linked to modulating the dopaminergic system&#39;s activity, which plays a key role in various physiological and psychological processes.</p>

<p>In terms of biochemistry, when activated by dopamine binding, the D3 receptor contributes to regulating dopamine transmission by modulating the release of dopamine and its effects on target neurons. Activation of D3 receptors can lead to changes in intracellular signaling pathways, including alterations in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This can impact the activity of protein kinases and transcription factors, ultimately influencing gene expression and cellular responses.</p>

<p>The D3 receptor&#39;s role in the brain is associated with reward and motivation, making it relevant in conditions like addiction and mood disorders. Dysregulation of the D3 receptor has been linked to addictive behaviors and some psychiatric conditions. Understanding the function of the D3 receptor and its biochemistry is essential for developing targeted therapies that can modulate dopamine signaling pathways, potentially leading to more effective treatments for these disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say exact MOA but small dose dopamine anxiolytic itself. And we should take internal biochemistry and possible influence of dopamine on gaba system into account.</p>

<p>UPD: everything in high doses can be bad, that&#39;s a matter of fact. But compared to big boys stimulants I don&#39;t think bromantane in high dosages can cause anxiety higher than caffeine. 
Which is still strong enough for many individuals including me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yes, women can act the way these guys are acting. Her particular choice of the word Mansplaining was related to them telling her that they somehow know better than what her experience was than she did. That is patronizing &amp; condescending; a literal form of Mansplaining, whereas a female could do the same thing &amp; you could choice a word that is alignment with however you want to phrase it. From the Dictionary: the explanation of something by a man, typically to a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing.</p>

She felt FIRST that these guys were attacking her &amp; being condescending and it’s obvious when you read how they came at her telling her she was wrong &amp; they knew her experience more than she did.

<p>Yeah, I wasn&#39;t done, let me reply</p>

<p>I&#39;m not shaming her entire being for using a word, I&#39;m shaming the use of a word apart from whose used it. And I think it&#39;s sad that word was used because it made the following convorsations very heated/biased.</p>

<p>I can tell you how it&#39;s ironic that you are explaining a conversation to me as if my own perception of that conversation is wrong, in which you say explaining in a way that dismisses someone else&#39;s perception/experience is condescending etc etc. But here I would just pour fire on things. I brought Marshmellos with me, thats why</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing, where this should have stopped was both sides coming to to a conclusion that may it was the solvent that caused the reaction and not the bromatane itself.  Instead she posed her experience as fact, that the bromatane caused the burning in the throat - while her experience is completely valid, bromatane should not cause burns. Her statement made people upset, challenging her statements. When they opposed her, she said they were mansplaining which only adds fuel to the fire, and if she didn&#39;t want them to mansplain now, she is going to get a lot more of their opinions (&quot;mansplaining&quot;).</p>

<p>Now, had she pointed that out from the get go that it could have been a solvent issue OR if someone else pointed it out and they came to a middle ground that it was almost certainly the solvent and not bromatane itself, this silly conversation, name calling, and people getting their feelings hurt would have ceased pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Also, &quot;shaming for one word&quot; - one word can make a conversation stay positive or turn negative, which it clearly did make a huge difference on where this conversation went after she started telling everyone they are mansplaining. So, idk take what you will from that.</p>

<p>Severely depressed from Bromantane is nothing ive ever heard of and don’t know what could cause this. Do you think there are other contributing factors that could’ve caused SEVERE depression in your test subject, which that “test subject” i don’t get that. And a burnt throat from the nasal drip? That’s possible I guess if its carrier is something your allergic to. But for days??? Everychem is the most reputable vendor for Bromantane rn so its just mind blowing to me these symptoms are causes by Bromantane ALONE. First ive heard of such symptoms from Brom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what? He’s posing legitimate criticism to your anecdotes, he’s not mansplaining nor is he gaslighting you. This could have been from the caprylic acid solvent or the bromantane or from the individual’s sensitivities but it is also an N=1 anecdote that cannot be taken as the be all end all for safety for bromantane. Bromantane has a half life of 7 hours so the symptoms could not have possibly gone on that long unless it was a reaction not to the bromantane but to something else. It’s possible that an adverse reaction was caused by the bromantane but this would be a rare occurrence and the evidence suggests it was not the bromantane but possibly a reaction to the caprylic acid or the individual’s sensitivities</p>
