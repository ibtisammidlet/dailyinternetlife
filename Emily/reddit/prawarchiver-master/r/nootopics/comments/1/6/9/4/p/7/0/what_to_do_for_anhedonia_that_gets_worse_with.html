        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I only respond to pure GABAergic or dopamine (without NE) things. All stimulants or stim-like things trigger more horrid emotional blunting for me unfortuately. This even includes things like Parnate where right away on the first day just 5 mg I got the more motivation, libido but a terrible robotic increased blunting feeling. Felt like Ritalin, which also blunts me horribly.</p>

<p>Recently also have tried Nardil at a very low dose 3.75 and 7.5 mg. The first 2 days of 3.75 mg my symptoms were relieved, I felt the GABA effect and the entire world was brighter, was smiling more and I thought this was it. Then as a few days passed I started feeling more blunted, lost morning wood, zeroedd my already low libido, etc from what I think was serotonergic sides.</p>

<p>Even the supplement DLPA I could not tolerate, because it was very stimulating and blunted me more for a few days. However, Tyrosine and Mucuna Pruriens I can tolerate and they help slightly.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Bromantane also subtly slightly helps but isn&#39;t enough. It (along with TAK) is actually the only &#39;stimulant&#39; that I react well to. I&#39;ve tried the peptide MIF-1 multiple cycles and that was probably the most amazing thing for anhedonia but the problem is its a 5 day cycle and the effects don&#39;t really last.</p>

<p>I already do exercise like 20 mins of cardio a day. Does not help my anhedonia/blunting symptoms. These symptoms are incredibly resistant.</p>

<p>Pregabalin 200 mg helps, but builds tolerance and after using it  every few days I started getting bad rebounds so I limit it even more now.</p>

<p>AlloP drops and Etifoxine worked amazing the first 1-2 days and then just didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>TAK-653 (the AMPA PAM) worked amazing the first time, then didn&#39;t do too much, then randomly worked amazing again and then didn&#39;t do too much. It seems like anything that helps I develop extremely rapid tolerance. I&#39;m starting to wonder if I have some underlying horrible metabolic/inflammatory dysregulation that leads to this.</p>

<p>It sucks that I get more blunted on stims or serotonergic stuff, as this represents basically the only classes of medications we have. I cannot risk SSRI/SNRI either and something like Wellbutrin is very risky for me given my severe stimulant blunting sensitivity.</p>

<p>Worsened anhedonia from stimulants (which inhibit AMPA/mGlur1 signaling) means it’s glutamate based, and I’ve personally cut my dose of d-amp to 1/4th now that things are flowing smoothly :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah seems like aberrant glutamate signaling for sure then— NAC restores normal function to glutamate antiporters, and Neboglamine enhances the beginning of the signal cascade via mGlur1.</p>

<p>Funny enough I had the same response to TAK-653, but Neboglamine was an entirely different ballpark (especially when paired with the NAC).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you want pure dopamine? 3-brmodafinil is a modafinil analog that&#39;s about as clean of a DRI as it gets - the effect on NE really is virtually zero. people on the discord actually dislike it because of how pure dopamine it is, but it&#39;s probably perfect for you. tak-653 has no tolerance by the way (its mechanism isn&#39;t capable of having tolerance or withdrawal), something else might be going on there.</p>

<p>What about TAK makes it not have tolerance?</p>

<p>Also is low dose armodafinal say 25 mg or less mostly dopamine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually tested Parnate and Nardil, albeit briefly, recently. Mentioned in the post but the Parnate has the stim like effect which results in blunting. That I only tried for 2 days and couldn’t tolerate the increased blunting. </p>

<p>While Nardil I just tried and actually day 1-2 massively helped but then its serotonergic side effects like no morning wood and no libido along with more blunting kicked in on day 3-4 and now at a week feel worse. I also got bad bloating from it. </p>

<p>It seems like my symptoms just get worse with MAOIs due to both the stim and serotonergic sensitivities. I need something just GABAergic or just dopaminergic. Something like Zuranolone is basically what I am waiting for but hoping I can somehow manage until then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya my doctor told me to break the pill in half for parnate &amp; nardil since im sensitive. Which is evidently the case considering I had a reaction to both, except for nardil it was initially positive then over the week it was more blunting while parnate was more blunting right away from the stim effect just like ritalin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt wait that long as implied above because the side effects involved worsening in the symptoms that I am trying to treat, and I didn’t want to risk a crash. Like with Parnate I tried just 2 days and the stimulant robotic feeling was really bad and still took like 3 days after to resolve. Nardil I took for 1 week which as I said first 2 days was great I thought it was working right away but then its own blunting from what I think was serotonin (due to losing morning wood and 0ing my already low libido as well) happened. </p>

<p>So basically emotional blunting worsened in diff ways on both (parnate immediately, nardil over a few days after initial massive improvement). </p>

<p>I think my glutamate system is messed up like one comment here said and can’t handle them at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally understand where you&#39;re coming from. The medication trialing procedure is so fatiguing and depressing. I&#39;ve been on a Prozac trial for a few weeks and the first two weeks I had worsening depression and anxiety. Things have felt better in the third week. Sometimes things get worse before they get better. Or, the medications just aren&#39;t for you. It&#39;s a crapshoot- albeit a painful and exhausting one.</p>
