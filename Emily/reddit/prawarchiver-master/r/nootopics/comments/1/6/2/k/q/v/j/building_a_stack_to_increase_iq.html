    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">14</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../../user/itrn7rec.html">itrn7rec</a> 2023-08-27</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Some of my personal thoughts/experiences that may be of relevance, you probably know some of these points but I also just wanted to get some feedback tbh:</p>

<p>TAK can be a bit stimulating, and dosage has to be right to see benefits ime. You&#39;d be surprised how much the balance between optimal stimulation &amp; focus can make or break peak performance on something like a grad level standardized exam(Tropi helped me stay in this balance on TAK). I also experienced reduced need for sleep (needed an hour less over several weeks of taking 2-3mg/day). It could also be the case that while many people do see concrete enhancements in cognitive function, for some the benefits are not as reliable, like for me. I suggest you test it out alone, try finding an optimal dose, and track performance on something challenging like dual n back or GRE reading section. This will be well worth it I think.</p>

<p>4DMA-7,8-DHF: I have not seen any studies on brain-wide localization after ingestion. I think this is key because in some regions straight up generally enhancing neuroplasticity would not be as beneficial, perhaps even detrimental. Ime it can allow greatly reduced fatigue after hours of mental work, and can be stimulating/make your focus a bit off in a way similar to mild ADHD, in fact this has been my experience with generally acting powerful neuroplasticity enhancers like Dihexa and both microdosing/macrodosing. But it has its uses, especially once in a while when you feel like you&#39;re stuck. Ime the sweet spot between synaptogenesis induced impulsivity/dysregulation of established cognitive patterns and the need for a &quot;boost&quot; to generate new patterns and break out of a rut can be accessed consistently through cycling, say 2-3 days on 7-10 days off. This was when I was studying 10+ hrs a day for an exam for over two months. I&#39;ve always had this notion of cycling between periods of synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning to continuously produce incremental optimizations in efficiency to local structure and my recent experience only bolsters it. That said it may be due to the fact that my general experience with noots/history/etc all match up and point to a brain structure similar to (probably very mild)autism, which entails excessive local dendritic density and hypersensitivity in some aspects, and thus for someone else, that sweet spot is very different.</p>

<p>Semax: this shit probably worked for me, but effect size is not large. No small dysregulation of cognitive patterns, no impulsivity, enhanced focus, good balance between stimulation and calm taken alone. I used dual n back to track its effects and it seems to have a mild 10-20% increase in the rate of improvement past the 1-2 month plateau(assuming you&#39;re familiar with this), over a month or so.</p>

<p>Cardio: ime absolutely crucial for cognitive enhancement, I have experimented with this for years and used to be a middle distance runner, the first two of which I experienced massive improvements in IQ(but I was 15-17 years old so it&#39;s not a reliable measure, but still). I suggest two modes: 1. Interval training 15sec max effort, 1min 45sec walking rest, build up to repeating 4-8 time depending on fitness. Great for enhancing pain tolerance which helps a ton during studying as well. I had this idea of interval training inducing mild hypoxia ultimately resulting in enhanced pruning of overproduced/underutilized dendritic branches, no idea if this is scientifically backed, but over years of doing this, I would say it works one way or the other. 2. Long distance zone 2 (I personally stayed around 150-165 bpm/near my lactate threshold) build up to 45min then focus on increasing speed. Occaisional long sessions of up to 1.5-2hrs every 3-4 weeks or so can also greatly improve mitochondrial profile and has been a great way to cause a huge metabolic stress spike which I would argue can be good every once in a while given proper recovery and some experience training. This specifically helps with enhancing prolonged focus, and apparently increasing hippocampal and frontal lobe size. I had a period where I had to train exclusively long distance for several months, and by then I had laser focus and supreme executive control, but also what felt like a marked reduction in creativity/random thoughts/new patterns of cognition. This again gets at the idea of that sweet spot between neuroplasticity induced new patterns of cognition vs focus/pruning induced stabilization and strengthening of practiced patterns of cognition. I suggest HIIT, rest, zone 2, rest, repeat. I lift on my cardio rest days and workout 6 days a week. Expect to see the very noticeable improvements after several months. New hippocampal cells apparently take 3-4 weeks to mature, and long term structural changes in other regions take a while to be really noticeable, or so I&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>Dual n back: I&#39;ve tried it for a while, intermittently and consistently. It works for the first several months, I want to say around 4-6 months, after which the benefits seem to be incremental. That said I think that if after the 2 month newbie gains period you&#39;re at dual 6 back and after an year of training you&#39;re at consistent dual 12 back, you can&#39;t not have enhanced your IQ by several points simply due to the massive effect size. But it depends on whether you were truly at your functioning maximum at all points. Nowadays, syllogimous V3 seems a bit more interesting, and tbh doing a shit ton of reading complicated, dense, and diverse texts probably is more helpful and useful long term depending on occupation/goals. Good for a medium term several months challenge tho, and those can yield some concrete benefits ime. I imagine 6 months dual n back, switching to something else like syllogimous v3 for 6 months, then maybe an instrument/new language for another 6 months, and so on, and occaisionally returning to past endeavors for a few months every once in a while can yield long term not just new skills but also increased intelligence at some level. Or so I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it&#39;s a bit hard to say because you kind of need different ones for different purposes and those purposes all converge to enhance task performance, of which idk exactly how much would be strictly IQ. And most of this being situational and individual to a large degree doesn&#39;t help much either. Bromantane for example can be great for reversing short term anhedonia due to extremely stressful periods, and this is important because once you go deeper down that hole it impacts your general cognitive function a shit ton. And if you&#39;re super stressed because you&#39;re studying 10+ hrs a day for months, then it&#39;s absolutely critical for maintaining optimal performance throughout. You also can&#39;t ignore basic supplements like PQQ, a choline source, DHA-1000, B complex, taurine etc and good healthy sources of fats, and things like blueberries and dark chocolate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say extensively testing nebo could prove beneficial as well although it might depend on individual brain structure and neurochemistry. And racetams too. Basically the big everychem stuff like pinealon, roxa, tropi, brom, carnosic acid, etc are probably all worth experimenting with individually just to see if you can push yourself further on those. Methylene blue seems really cool too, would be interesting to compare with an NAD related supplement.</p>

<p>Most importantly, you have to be doing something where you&#39;re pushing your ceiling constantly to have a nuanced sensitivity to the effects of these. Or that&#39;s just been my experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m quite familiar with Semax and 4-dma 7,8-Dhf, but still waiting to receive Tak.</p>

<p>4-DMA 7,8--DHF works quite well but will, after some time, seems do downregulate TrkB (being a potent TrkB agonist)
Some people seem to pair it with Semax with success...did not try, but it pairs well with Polygala (which upregulates TrkB)...seems to do the trick.</p>

<p>TAK + Semax seems ok on paper, some people do it.</p>

<p>But I would be a bit concerned to take Tak + Semax + 7,8-DHF, as two of them are quite experimental.</p>

<p>AMPA Pam + TrkB agonist a the same time...well...I&#39;d surely prefer to cycle them to avoid messing something up.</p>

<p>Reminder: Noots can make your more focused and improve memory, making your brain work well, like a well maintained and optimised car or like a good pre-workout when you train, but they don&#39;t improve anything by themselves, they mainly make your brain work smooth, they are not some kind of overdrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NSI-189 has some decent results for verbal fluency I believe its a DRI, NRI, and has weak MOR binding </p>

<p>Magnesium L theronate helps modulate gaba, and sodium potassium channels which facilitates spatial awareness via NR2B upregulation</p>

<p>CDP-Choline or Acetyl L Carnitine would bd good for acetylcholine (ALCAR also helps activates AMPK which upregulates insulin receptor and sensitivity as well as DRD1, and 5HT-1A)</p>

<p>NAC helps protect against some types of hepatotoxcity, and regulates Glutamate, Acetylcholine, and Dopamine.</p>

<p>TUDCA. has another mechanism separate from NAC thay facilitates liver protection.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take Alpha GPC as it has about a 47% risk of stroke with use</p>

In the Study they say after a half jear vegan the gut bacteria changed so ther was no risk... But every one is individual. Dr. Steven Gundy sayed he had 2 vegan patients who sill produce TMAO but the dond know whow...
