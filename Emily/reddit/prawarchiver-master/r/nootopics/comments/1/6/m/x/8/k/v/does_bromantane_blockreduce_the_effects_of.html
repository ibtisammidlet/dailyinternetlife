        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So I have spent a while searching Reddit and other forums for the answer to this. Many individuals say that they enjoy the combination. The thing is, I saw <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> say that <em>Bromantane blocks the effects of Phenibut</em> on a thread. I attempted to message him but he&#39;s a busy man and I imagine he didn&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My personal experience is that I have noticed that it does seem to reduce the euphoric effects of Phenibut. I still feel the anxiolytic effects of it, but not the euphoria.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>What are your thoughts/experiences, ladies and gentlemen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly. Dulls the euphoria and “disinhibition” but does keep the anxiolysis. </p>

<p>Fuck phenibut though in general. It does help anxiety a tonne but it’s not a long term solution. It keep you reliant on it and deludes you in a way where you think you’ll always need it for certain situations eventually.</p>

<p>Take a couple days off from the phenibut or taper off (however dependant you are) and I recommend Bromantane spray in HIGH doses (8-10 sprays).</p>

<p>It’ll remind you of your old friend phenibut ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, you’re so right. I’ve done this before too where I use phenibut for way too long. The point where it doesn’t help at all or do anything but negative side effects. </p>

<p>I’m going to taper off now. I typically do a rapid take because I lack the discipine for a slow taper. I typically just want be be done with it, plus honestly people exaggerate or are way too sensitive to the withdrawal symptoms in my opinion. It may be though because I’ve gone through opioid withdrawal many times. </p>

<p>I was using 10-15 grams a day of phenibut, 2-3 grams a day of F-Phenibut (sometimes both at the same time). Baclofen doesn’t work well for me. I feel weird on Baclofen. I tapered very rapidly from those doses (using phenibut for 4.5 months), and it was not bad at all. Used Baclofen for 1 day then stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you man.</p>

<p>I’ve been through your situation and have been dependant on phenibut and I completely agree with what you say about the withdrawals. They’re blown way out of proportion on the quitting phenibut subreddit.</p>

<p>If you have Agmatine and NAC, it’ll be an absolute breeze. Agmatine twice a day at 1g and NAC twice a day at 600mg</p>

<p>I recommend doing a taper, then using both of those as glutamate modulating tools as your glutamate will be FUCKED after that. This should help with PAWS. This should then put you into homeostasis.</p>

<p>Then phenibut replacements in order similarity can be:</p>

<p>Flmodafinil+Guanfacine, 
Flmodafinil or any non damaging stim on its own if you’re not prone to GAD, 
Bromantane high dose, 
Kava, 
Kanna.</p>

<p>Hope this helps man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks bro. How do you feel about TAK? I’ve run it five times now and I really don’t like it very much. I feel like it reduces my exercise capacity and other than that I really don’t notice any effects.. IDRA-21 on the other hand, I found is way more noticeable and effective but it’s a high risk medication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally like TAK at 2mg. It helps me put puzzle pieces together if there is something I was thinking about for a while and trying to figure out. It gives me a very pronounced effect. </p>

<p>However, if I use it 2 or 3 days in a row, I overthink on it a lot and get completely stuck on a thought without ever moving off of it. </p>

<p>So I use it only when I completely need to if I have to learn something or just generally whenever I want to.</p>

<p>Tbh when I was dependant on phenibut, I did not notice any effects on it because my glutamate was out of whack. Maybe that is the case for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be the case! I’ll save the rest of the bottle for when I’m off. 3 of the times I’ve run it I wasn’t on Phenibut. I do notice the overthinking for sure. I’m going to do the same as you, only on days I really need it.</p>

<p>It’s nice to discuss this with someone who seems experienced with nootropics/peptide. I feel like half this subreddit is full of people who know absolutely nothing or just read a couple studies and act like subject matter experts. The other 1/4 is people looking for euphoriants.</p>

<p>Another Id recommend is Lithium Orotate. It feels like a very mild benzo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, thanks. How does that intranasal dose equate to sublingual w/ the powder? For me a high dose is closer to 150-200mg…</p>

<p>I’m interested in learning why everybody here seems to prefer the intranasal spray… Is it superior bioavailability that makes it a better value? Convenience? Both? </p>

<p>I’ve tried both &amp; the powder sublingually seems to work better for me &amp; I also find it more convenient. It seems like I might be the only one that feels this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah for me sublingually I do notice effects but they’re quite weak whereas intranasally it gives me strong pronounced effects and within a shorter onset time as well.</p>

<p>I couldn’t compare intranasal and sublingual dose effects as for me they feel quite different. If I was to put a dose conversion on it I’d say around 200mg sublingual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me personally, it gives me a huge boost in motivation, reduction in anxiety, increase in talkativeness and a general sense of well being. There’s also this euphoric feeling in my chest, especially when I’ve spiked my noradrenaline by getting in a cold shower or gone for a run etc.</p>

<p>Bromantane does that for me anyway but it’s just way more pronounced.</p>

<p>I know what you mean by the “down” effect though. I’m guessing you mean sedation?</p>

<p>This only happens when I’ve not had enough protein in my diet, not had caffeine or just sat in one place for a while.</p>

<p>To counteract this, a cup or two of coffee will do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m going to try this maybe today I snorted 50mg powder 25mg each side the 2 mists in the left and one in the right. I will add a few more and see how I feel . I definitely get enough protein and stuff into my diet so I think I’ll go for this!! </p>

<p>Edit did 4 more sprays so I’ll check in later</p>

<p>Ok so I’m relaxed to the max. Like I don’t think I would care of my gas station I work at got robbed lol. I am kinda tired so I just took 209mg caffeine so and I should eat something also.</p>

<p>It’s similar to phenibut you are correct though</p>

<p>Edit ok so. This is nice but I think I like my four sprays in the am and then sometimes two sprays at lunch</p>

<p>It also seems to have zapped all motivation to any physical activities but I’m mentally aware and I want to sit and read lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it reduces the euphoria from phenibut whilst the drowsiness from higher dosages remains the same. </p>

<p>It is a shame if youre using phenibut recreationally, but hey your everyday life gets better instead. Pregabalin seems to be pretty unaffected tho <em>wink wink</em></p>
