        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Stack:</p>

<p>2000mg of ALCAR + 1500mg of Gotu Kola + 320mg of Bacopa (Doctor‘s Best Synapsa)</p>

<p>Diagnosed and reason of supplementing:</p>

<p>Treatment-resistant depression and Social Anxiety</p>

<p>My success with this stack:</p>

<p>I‘m dosing this for about 40 days now, sometimes like once weekly a day off and once in my whole experimenting I went 5 days off in a row to see if it comes with any withdrawal or rebound.</p>

<p>There was no issue being off of it after the intake as described above. I also didn‘t experience any side effects except for some insomnia that happens sometimes but is not that bad that I would see it as an issue for what this stack gives me.</p>

<p>My depression and social anxiety decreased drastically, this stuff is really powerful. I have a better mood, laugh more, am more sociable, talkative, jokey, less socially awkward, less depressed or anxious about the future and past, I feel cognitively sharper, much better memory, more focus, better attention and bigger drive - and I feel way more fit and energetic, physically as well as mentally.</p>

<p>It‘s been one of the greatest stacks I’ve tried so far. That‘s it and it‘s been better than any antidepressant (and I‘ve tried over 14 psychiatric prescription meds, many different docs, 2 depth-analytical therapies, 1 cognitive-behavioral therapy, alternative therapies as hypnosis etc. and nothing helped this well and continuously).</p>

<p>My issue / question:</p>

<p>Now I‘m thinking of adding another compound: Black Seed Oil. I remember that once I really took it rigorously and constantly disciplined like a teaspoon of unfiltered 2-3x day, I also felt a big improvement in my depression and social anxiety. So I wanna try adding this to improve my mental health and yearlong misery of hating my life, being unable ble to do normal stuff and thinking about death even more.</p>

<p>Anyone knows if it‘s OK to add Black Seed Oil to ALCAR, Gotu Kola and Bacopa - or how it might affect these - any risks/dangers/interactions?  Pharmacologically as well as from own experiences? I know BSO might be dangerous if used daily by possibly affecting GABA too much, but how big is this risk or may I reduce it by taking breaks like 2 weeks on 2 weeks off?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help and best wishes y‘all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s unrelated to your question, unfortunately I have no experience with Black Seed Oil.</p>

<p>I just wanted to ask, did you also try Bromantane? </p>

<p>I think everyone on this subreddit discovered for either ALCAR and/or Bromantane that&#39;s why I ask. But personally I didn&#39;t like the effect that ALCAR (albeit smaller dose than 2g) had on me. So I was curious to hear your experience, since you seem to fare well on ALCAR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly Bromantane is forbidden and unavailable in my country or near by countries. I really wanted to try it for years. Never have been able to do so. Same for Sulbutiamine or other great promising supplements :(</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think BSO will have the contradictions you have mentioned</p>
