<p>boost dopamine post vyvanse use</p>

<p>improve mood </p>

<p>And it‚Äôs use as an actoprotecter</p>

<p>I‚Äôm using the spray at 28mg , but don‚Äôt notice much energy boost atm .</p>

<p>also using Agmatine to help benzo taper at 2g per day </p>

<p>question is , could it be the fact I‚Äôm already tapering benzos that I don‚Äôt get much stimulation from it and only two months out post vyvanse </p>

<p>Also could the Agmatine be dulling the feeling ?</p>

<p>Also using 500mg tyrosine before the bromantane .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking for more dopamine effect, you could add Sabroxy to your stack. It&#39;s a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Combined with Bromantane, you might feel more motivation.</p>

<p>With that said, Agmatine is an NMDA antagonist. It is going to give you a blunted feeling where dopamine feels different/off. It&#39;s just part of how it works, there isn&#39;t a way around it that we currently know of.</p>

<p>I recommend taking Agmatine before bed, at least 4 hours after a meal (because it competes with protein in food). It will do its job overnight. Then in the morning you can take your dopaminergics and they will feel good again.</p>

<p>The key with all of this is to play around with the dosages and timings for yourself. For instance, if you find that Agmatine makes your sleep not as good (it may or may not), then you may want to take it in the afternoon instead. But not in the morning, otherwise again dopamine won&#39;t feel as good. Same idea for Bromantane plus Sabroxy, try each one separately, then try them together, then try Bromantane 30 minutes before Sabroxy.</p>

<p>After running some tests like this on yourself, you&#39;ll find a system that works for you. Stick with that and you&#39;ll find success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Na-selank was better than selank for me - there was a noticeable energy boost.  With Bromantane, it was more theoretical than observable, st least for me. Ditto for agmatine. </p>

<p>Kava is a non-addictive, legal anxiolytic (beverage) that  you might try.  If can really help people reduce benzo use. Don‚Äôt bother with the pills on Amazon - you will want to make a traditional drink/shell.  Toss it down before you can taste it.  Search for it on Reddit and you‚Äôll learn all you need to know. </p>

<p>If should cut your taper in half. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was based on flawed research.  Long-term, heavy- drinkers end up weighing less than those who don‚Äôt drink. </p>

<p>Like alcohol, it is hard on your liver, so it shouldn‚Äôt be combined with alcohol, particularly on a regular basis.  </p>

<p>People use it to get off benzine snd booze, and also in place of alcohol as a safe intoxicant. </p>

<p>It can give you an euphoric rush as well, but it lasts just ten minutes. It‚Äôs great when it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently In the UK it‚Äôs illegal to import it sell it for human consumption.  It‚Äôs not illegal to import it if it‚Äôs not for human consumption, however.  Oddly it‚Äôs apparently legal to posses it for personal use.</p>

<p>In the US, I think that just effects marketing and labeling. They couldn‚Äôt make any health or medical claims about the product snd the label must read ‚Äúnot for human consumption‚Äù. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve got several nootropics with this exact label.  All legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It‚Äôs an anxiolytic - kava reduces anxiety.  A common complaint about anxiolytics is that they put you to sleep. </p>

<p>It may make you feel relaxed, content snd social.  The kavain may make you feel euphoric for fifteen minutes.  I‚Äôm not really energized, but I am social snd chatty, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Kava is postulated to have an impact on gaba and to be a reversible maoi (like many foods).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah plus I was used to the Max stimulation from vyvanse .</p>

<p>Reason I stopped vyvanse was coz of benzo taper and feel that I still needed something to upregulate dopamine from vyvanse use plus help the benzo withdrawal depression and to aid motivation . </p>

<p>also feel the bromantane has anxiolytic properties compared to traditional stims.</p>

Two months 
ordered the afazabole there too as read it can upregulate gaba a ? could be handy when I jump .</p>

<p>Is it ok to keep taking the selank and bromantane daily ? I feel they help the anxiety but worried if daily use is bad ?
Also just ordered the na selank spray version . </p>

<p>Just don‚Äôt wanna stop them atm in case my brain freaks out . </p>

<p>I‚Äôve probably got another seven weeks left of taper . </p>

<p>From what I know there shouldn&#39;t be a problem continuing daily, especially if they work well for you. Maybe you could see how you feel with vs without them after the taper is done? The worst I&#39;ve heard of selank doing is hairloss and bromantane is at worst an allergic reaction or just a non response to its effects.</p>
