        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wanted to briefly share my experiences with this research chemical because there doesn&#39;t seem to be much information or anecdotes on this stuff.</p>

<p>Dosage: .50ML (2mg)</p>

<p>Time Taken: 8-9 A.M.</p>

<p>Weight: 140lbs</p>

<p>Exercise: No</p>

<p>Drink: No</p>

<p>Smoke: No</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Tbh, when I first took Tak-653 I wasn&#39;t sure about the correct dose and took less than 1mg. Didn&#39;t feel anything(benefits) until I started taking 2mg. I have to say that my experience with this stuff has been positive. It doesn&#39;t give you quite the same eagerness as Piracetam or Phenylpiractam. It also doesn&#39;t give any kind of stimulated sensation. What I do get is the ability to stay calm and think slower. It&#39;s excellent at reducing anxiety.</p>

<p>My main reason for trying Tak-653 was to see if it could help with my verbal fluency and I can confidently say now that it does. It&#39;s not quite the same as phenibut but it allows me to find words and be able to express my thoughts easier while still maintaining a filter. With phenibut I would talk non-stop without caring what comes out of my mouth... Also wanted to note that it does nothing for irritation. Traffic and shitty drivers still piss me off.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s all I wanted to share. I&#39;ll report back if I experience any side effects. So far nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>:edit:</p>

<p>Oops, I forgot to mention this. The first 3 times I tried Tak-653, I had this strong desire to just listen to music and daydream. It was incredible how hard it enhanced my MDD. Not sure what happened but that seems to have somewhat gone away. I kind of feel like Tak-653 works better if you&#39;re out instead of being alone.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Few questions:</p>

<p>- Do I need to take a choline source like piracetam?</p>

<p>- Should I cycle off this stuff every once in awhile or is it safe to take every day?</p>

<p>- Any other supplements that synergizes with Tak-653 to enhance verbal fluency?</p>

<p>- What&#39;s the shelf life? Thinking about buying a few more bottles just to store it incase these become scarce. Only place I know to get it from is everychem</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. It did nothing for me at any dose. I tried  500ug all the way up to 4mg. It made me irritable one time, but every other time I didn’t notice any effects. I felt more from neboglamine, which is supposedly the lesser of the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting indeed. I guess it&#39;s true that not everyone reacts the same to certain chemicals/drugs. </p>

<p>I never even heard of neboglamine but i&#39;l look into that as well. thank you for chiming in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay good, I&#39;ll just save the choline on days where I take piracetam/phenylpiracetam. I&#39;m curious to hear about the cycling if you have any additional information. Like the cycling routines in order to keep tolerance from building. I&#39;d hate to lose the benefits or have to take more. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for aniracetam but if it&#39;s anything like Piracetam or Phenylpiracetam it&#39;s a different kind of verbal fluency. Like I mentioned, Tak-653 doesn&#39;t really give you any kind of stimulation or eagerness to want to talk to people. I find that phenylpiracetam, I am in a much more uplifted mood and feel happy. Being in that state always makes you more socialable. However, with Tak-653, I don&#39;t feel feel as happy but more of content. I can still enjoy having conversations with people and I don&#39;t have as much fear approaching them either. Hope that makes sense</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Sorry, can&#39;t help you there. I&#39;m way out of college and I was always dumb with math/physics. I can&#39;t say if i&#39;m able to pick up concepts any easier but I am learning about finance. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thank you for your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, for the late reply. I don&#39;t always get on this throwaway account. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I can sleep just fine on it. Never had any issues with it but I do take it first thing in the morning. Usually before 12pm. Though tbh, I have not taken it at all recently only because I still get some mild depression from it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>That is strange though and a crappy side effect. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else having any sleeping issues. I&#39;m usually the type of person that&#39;s very sensitive to drugs too. I&#39;m also taking only .5mg and never more than that. I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t have any solution to your problem but I would make a separate thread asking about it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Phenibut is weird. I&#39;ve been taking it for almost 3 years now. Never abused it but even taking it at my moderate doses and limiting it to max twice a week. I&#39;m starting to notice bruxism. Not to mention, phenibut just doesn&#39;t hit the same for me anymore. I suspect all the recent batches are not the same substance as before despite passing lab tests. There was an interesting post someone made in the phenibut subreddit that there are different types of Phenibut, so testing for purity only doesn&#39;t give you the entire picture of what you&#39;re getting.</p>
