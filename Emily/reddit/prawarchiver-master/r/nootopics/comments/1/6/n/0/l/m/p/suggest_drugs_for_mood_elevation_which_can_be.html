        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am searching for drugs which can be taken on regular basis, almost everyday, which will elevate the mood, make a bit happy, motivate me to work/study. (Currently not interested in focus, concentration... similar things) (motivate me to work/study is quite important right now, I don&#39;t have any motivation)</p>

<p>[By &#39;not interested in focus, concentration...&#39;, I mean that I am not focusing on these things, so if the nootropics you suggest don&#39;t improve these, it&#39;s fine, and if they improve these, then great. (I wanted to see more suggestions, ig by being not clear I decreased the possible suggestions)]</p>

<p>I know one ingredient won&#39;t be enough, so suggest a stack, or if you only know for one of the things, suggest for that. Just the important thing is that I plan to take them on regularly.</p>

<p>I think I will be taking it in the mornings, or twice a day, to have it&#39;s effects throughout the day.</p>

<p>___</p>

<p>I am new to nootropics, if you think I am asking something stupid, please point that out, and if you can please explain too. All kind of suggestions are welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,
I won&#39;t be very original, I think:</p>

<p>-about herbs: Rhodiola and/or good quality Ginseng are good for motivation and fatigue. Not overly powerful, but definitely not a placebo</p>

<p>-you may try this combo: 4-DMA 7&#39;8-DhF (semi synthetic compound, sold by Nootropics Depot) stacked with Polygala...but 7&#39;8-DHF has quite few studies...it works well for mood and motivation, but safety is not proven.</p>

<p>-Alcar is a good supp for energy (indirectly dopaminergic if I&#39;m not mistaken)</p>

<p>-Agmatine is good for mood and even against light depression</p>

<p>-Bromantane, again. That thing works, I was even surprised that it just works so well : it increases motivation and decreases anxiety. It&#39;s a safe compound. Not available in my country but I order it from Everychem. Even with the shipping fees, prices remain very reasonable.</p>

<p>I think the most powerful and safe stack would be Alcar + Bromantane. (+ Agmatine? it won&#39;t hurt)</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcar is worth trying being so cheap, but personally it actually puts me in a bad mood.</p>

<p>Bromantane I think I need a break because I&#39;ve used so much in the last month that I don&#39;t know anymore what it felt like before. It works someway, but it&#39;s subtle. I accidentally increased a lot my coffee habit since I started taking it, so I don&#39;t know how much should actually be addressed to that. I definitely have more energy and motivation, sometimes coming randomly. Still, I don&#39;t &quot;crave&quot; Bromantane like I would do with coffee, for example, so I guess it&#39;s really not addictive. Gonna take a couple weeks break and see what happens.</p>

<p>Agmatine I still cannot tell if it has to be taken regularly before feeling its effects. Maybe it&#39;s even more subtle than Bromantane but I&#39;m positive there may be something going on. Started taking about two weeks ago, I have more random cheerful moments, but again, nothing so far has a constant effect that really impacts my daily life.</p>

<p>I would say that the assumption of these supplements increases the <em>probability</em> of me being in a good and motivated mood, lasting anywhere from a couple minutes to several hours.</p>

<p>My nr.1 supplement anyway:</p>

<p>Sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep. Is. King.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is NOT a nootropic. But you also said your not interested in Focus, concentration, etc.</p>

<p>Kratom checks a lot of those boxes.
Maeng Da strains specifically I would say.</p>

<p>I’d say to do plenty of research if you did as there is side effects. And if you want to take it daily you will become dependent on it. </p>

<p>For me I outweighed the pros and cons and it was worth it for me to take Kratom daily and be dependent.</p>

<p>You can also cycle through adaptogens . Some will work better than others. Rhodiola , ginseng, etc.</p>

<p>Bromantanes a good one that is a true nootropic.</p>

<p>Look into agmatine too. I’ll notice my mood getting better after a few days. No side effects. Also is good for pumps if you use it preworkout.</p>

<p>I am also on top. finasteride, so it&#39;s already reducing DHT, so won&#39;t risk with something which lowers testosterone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah kratom is just a shortterm solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh. Thanks.</p>

<p>From what I read, finasteride inhibits conversion of T to DHT, it can&#39;t lower T concentration (elevates T concentration cause it&#39;s not getting converted to DHT, but for how long I don&#39;t know), and DHT didn&#39;t seem to be having any use in body in adults, apart from libido. That&#39;s why I use it to prevent/undo male pattern baldness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t take kratom maybe once a week if that if you’re natural it’s going to destroy you I was using it for 1 year on 200mg test while working out and eating correctly and I had zero sex drive lost all motivation and had problems in my relationship from how careless it made me lol obviously not everyone would have the same thing happen but it’s definitely no joke. </p>

<p>I’ll say this kratom for me is more addicting then adderall or any other stimulant and way more addicting then phenibut &amp; the withdrawls are awful people you see defending it and boasting about it are still in the honeymoon phase I did the same exact thing Lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much same, I use kratom low doses in a fonctional way, for work, for focus, motivation, energy. And I know it&#39;s an opioid dependency.</p>

<p>I also take vitamins, minerals, antioxydants and adaptogens.</p>

<p>I recently adopted agmatine sulfate (from EC), as I feel it&#39;s lowering my kratom tolerance and it&#39;s enhancing the effects (more sustainable boost for longer period of time if I take a morning dose of agmatine with my morning kratom). And I feel a nice antidepressant effects that counteract the stimulants crashes.</p>

<p>I take bromantane one or twice a week, to help stabilize my dopaminergic system.</p>

<p>I also take maca daily and tongkat ali regularly to counteract the anti-testosteron effect of kratom.</p>

<p>I recently needed an extra boost for lots of continuous days of hard work. So I tried fladrafinil (easiest afinil available in my country) 200mg in the morning, as lower doses wasn&#39;t enough. And I would say the boost of alertness is significant and long lasting. I&#39;m gonna see if the effects decrease with several days of use.</p>

Never ordered from them, though, so I don&#39;t have any opinion.</p>

<p>For Everychem, no problem at all, just buy and pay by Credit Card. I&#39;ve ordered from France without any problem (one order was seized by customs, but it was my fault, as there was Tropisetron in the package: I did not know that Tropisetron was regulated in France.)</p>

<p>No problem with a big order containing Bromantane, Tak-653, na-Semax, Selank and some other things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it depends of what we call Nootropic.</p>

<p>If you consider that any substance which maintains the brain in optimal shape as a nootropic, I would say &quot;yes&quot;, taking some useful vitamins, some amino-acids i tend to lack and maybe an adaptogen I react well with.
For example, I take Spirulina, Magnesium, a bit of Fish Oil and Ginseng or Rhodiola every day. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to draw a line between &quot;brain enhancing&quot; and &quot;maintaining the brain in a healthy state&quot;</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll take more specific Nootropics (focus oriented, or stimulating ones) only when I need them, for  example for periods when I have to work for more than 8 hours a day on complex tasks or when I need a little boost on very specific tasks.</p>

<p>Can we take it daily!? </p>

<p>Also btw, adderall or amphetamines are banned in my country. Methylphenidate is the alternative available.</p>

<p>By saying I am not interested in focus and concentration, I meant even if they are not increased by the nootropics, I don&#39;t care. If they are improved too, then great, but my focus is not focus and concentration.</p>

<p>ALCAR seems to help with energy, am I right?</p>

<p>Agmantine is being recommended before workout, to reduce muscle soreness.</p>

<p>Are these for high doses? and on low doses help with mood??</p>

<p>Can you also tell your dosage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do a little googling.  Search in Reddit as well.  There’s a lot of info in Reddit alone.  Agmatine is not just for workouts, body builders use it yes but not for muscle soreness.  Agmatine and ALCAR both have multi benefits.  Is it right for you?  I just added a couple supps to look into.  We are our own self experiments, education/knowledge will be your friend.  Suggest investing in a milligram scale (cheap on Amazon) and empty capsules for exact dosing when using bulk supplements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not sure your question. if you asking if I can take as needed per se, yes.  you really need to look up what each of these supplements do.  Each has dosing requirements for particular therapeutic effects.  Search in nootropics and nootopics here in Reddit, there’s folks that have done good write ups on these supplements.</p>
