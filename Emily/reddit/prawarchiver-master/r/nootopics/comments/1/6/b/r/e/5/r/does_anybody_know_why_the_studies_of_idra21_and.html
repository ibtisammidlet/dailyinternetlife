        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Both of these substances have shown promising cognitive-enhancing effects in early studies, but it seems like further research has been abandoned.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>- IDRA-21, is an ampakine compound, that has been noted for enhancing learning and memory.</p>

<p>- PRL-8-53 is a derivative of benzoic acid and phenylmethylamine that has effects on human memory enhancement.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s odd that these compounds haven&#39;t been studied more extensively. Is it a matter of funding, lack of interest, or are there safety concerns that aren&#39;t widely discussed?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Also there are more compounds than the two I mentioned that had the same thing happen to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it isn&#39;t about subjective effects, but from what I could notice IDRA-21 did significantly more to me, only down side is its probable long mode of action.</p>

<p>Tak-653 is not something of which I noticed any difference/impact. But perhaps only comparing results of repeated IQ tests while cycling the 2 compounds (and sober) are valid enough to consider drawing conclusions on their relative impact</p>

<p>From a theoretical pov: Maybe variables in our biological complexities can make tak-653 work less effective than the (cheaper) idra-21 for me specifically, despite what current research might indicate to &#39;be the best&#39;.</p>

<p>(Or maybe I need a way higher dose of tak-654 than what was recommend, but that would be really expensive for me)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their best achievements imo were bromantane and somewhat piracetam although technically the guy who invented it and the concept of nootropics was based in Romania </p>

<p>Phenylpiracetam is just an a4b2 full agonist which isn&#39;t as exciting, but yeah it feels good</p>

<p>It seems like the west and japan are actually coming out with more nootropics but just not purposing them as such. It would be cool if it had adoption at a governmental level but it is what it is</p>
