        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Was delighted to learn that sigma-1 agonism is something bromantane does since bromantane came up in this sub recently and it got me thinking about how I’d love to learn what others supplements and research chems have sigma-1 agonism.</p>

<p>What are some y’all know of and/or have tried? Here are the ones I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opipramol (anti anxiety drug only available in the EU)</li>
<li>Luvox/Fluvoxamine (SSRI that has sigma-1 agonism, more than related SSRIs like Prozac that also touch sigma-1)</li>
<li>Fasoracetam (nootropic, hard to find/buy? weirdly not talked about much at all)</li>
<li>Bromantane</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like research indicates sigma-1 activism could be a component of the anti anxiety effects of many psychiatric drugs. Lends itself to some of the hypothesis that certain mental health issues could be from issues with cellular metabolism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These mentioned σ1 modulators have poor selectivity.  </p>

<p>The best σ1 allosteric modulator seems to be E1R (methylphenylpiracetam).<br/>
The best σ1 agonist seems to be PRE-084.  </p>

<p>σ1 agonism can enhance addictive behaviors through enhanced dopamine release, so using a PAM agent rather than an agonist would likely be more desirable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my goodness, my brain clearly needs some of these things we talk about in this sub - you’re absolutely right about methylphenylpiracetam. I don’t know why is misremembered it, that is actually the one I meant to recall.</p>

<p>Can you tell me a little bit about how PAMs and agonists behave different with respect to reward/behavior? I’ve always been a little confused about the end effect even thought I know a PAM enhances activity at the receptor and an agonist is kind of like an on switch for the receptor itself. Also realize I could be wrong about that too though! Thank you so much for your reply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A PAM binds to the allosteric site on the receptor, enhancing endogenous production. It potentiates receptor activity that already exists basically. Agonists bind directly to the receptor itself (not the allosteric site), and they are different because they cause a surge in receptor activity rather than enhancing existing signals.

    <div class="md"><p>None of them are good. Potentially high dose afobazole, but it&#39;s just too expensive (at least with the sources I&#39;m aware of) to maintain. You would also need to cycle it, as inevitably it would downregulate as I&#39;m aware happened to someone with a crazy sigma-1 stack in the nootopics discord. I hope someday someone synthesizes methylphenylpiracetam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Berberine is mostly for secondary diabetics or poor people with metabolism as an AMPK activator, but has sigma agonism as one of its mechanism. I used to use it in past and worked pretty well, giving bit like opioid like subtle feel what is different to most of this herbal stuff what I have done. Mayby that is due of sigma character of it, I dont know but intuitively I feel like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If be hesitant to put too much weight on the receptor alone. The signaling cascades all would be extremely dependent on the biological context. 
I suppose a way to really see about it’s anxiolytic effects would be too compare luvox and other ssris in their treatment of anxiety.
But dxm is an agonist that’s easily accessible in lower doses it helps my depression. They actually patented it and Wellbutrin for depression.</p>

<p>But I believe cocaine, meth, dmt, and berberine are other agonists. I haven’t looked into it in a long time so I might be wrong.</p>
