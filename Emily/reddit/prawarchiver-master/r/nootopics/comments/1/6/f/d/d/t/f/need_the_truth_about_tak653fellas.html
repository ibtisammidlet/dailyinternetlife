    <div class="md"><p>I went though a dropper of tak and personally didn’t like it. It strongly increased my introspective thinking which gave me a more analytical headspace throughout the day. However I’m naturally pretty introspective so tak took it over the edge and caused me to feel dissociative and a little autistic in social situations (really noticeable at 4mg and greater). Like someone would initiate small talk and instead of have a clique automatic response, it would make me consciously think of a response which causes a noticeable delay. Though if you’re alone and are contemplating a philosophical concept or any complex out of the box problem it’s very effective at bringing about good trains of thought and keeping them going (akin to cannabis imo). This thought amplification effect can be turned on itself tho cause if you’re in a negative headspace it will make the negative thoughts 10x louder and provide more reasons to reinforce them.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, when you were five years old your older sister gave you an insecurity complex that&#39;s permeated into an unconscious defense strategy which you have a fear reaction to that turned into frustration at the thought of unearthing an old wound you didn&#39;t want to confront.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thoroughly enjoy(ed) TAK-653. I&#39;ve experimented with a large number of nootropics - both conventional and unconventional - and TAK is my favorite so far.</p>

<p>I began noticing the effects after a few days of use. Also, I used 8mg split up into two doses of 4mg.</p>

<p>Here are the primary positive effects I&#39;ve had:</p>

<p><strong>Complexity Tolerance</strong></p>

<p>TAK has increased my ability to *remain* focused on a complex problem and reason through it. Before TAK, there were some topic areas that I could only think about in brief periods before I felt cognitively fatigued. There seem to be two distinct effects contributing to this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reducing the burden itself: I notice that TAK results in significantly *more* connections being made to unfamiliar material. My ability to understand novel (to me) concepts by analogizing them to concepts I already understand is improved, which reduces how &quot;foreign&quot; some new concept feels.</li>
<li>Secondly, it seems that I can hold a larger number of disjoint concepts in my mind at once. I guess this would suggest some sort of improvement on working memory, though I hesitate to conjecture that working memory improvements are the mechanism of action here.</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also found that my memory has improved; the frequency that I have to refer back to notes or re-read papers in the course of doing research is absolutely less than it was before starting TAK.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Ease of Deduction</strong></p>

<p>It is easier for me to perform &quot;just in time&quot; inference <strong>and</strong> first-principle based reasoning. Even my spouse has noticed my improved reasoning &amp; planning; my improved ability to optimize my own time; my improved performance during a debate (spouse and I often discuss some topic of mutual interest at length, which usually involves debate. She has noted my arguments are stronger and terser).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>This is, I believe, a second-order effect that results from the direct effect TAK has had on the process of <strong>introspection</strong>.</p>

<p>Specifically, I am more reflective about my own behaviors, thought patterns, and macro-level direction. Introspection is also more dispassionate. A corollary to that is that I find I&#39;m more able to be &quot;honest with myself&quot; without experiencing the stress that comes when you realize  - for example - you&#39;ve been avoiding some set of unpleasant responsibilities for too long and now you&#39;re absolutely screwed. Instead of feeling like that, it feels more like &quot;ok, another problem to solve. Here are my initial ideas. Let&#39;s create a decision tree&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Gaming</strong></p>

<p>Another interesting phenomenon I&#39;ve observed is that my performance in competitive video games is a lot better. In fact, for some games that I&#39;ve played for years now, I have found myself ranked multiple tiers higher than I&#39;ve ever been ranked before. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Aggression</strong></p>

<p>I would say it has increased my aggression a bit, as well. It isn&#39;t &quot;anger&quot;, nor is it the sort of aggression you might experience from testosterone-related treatments. It is more that I&#39;ve found myself less patient with people who aren&#39;t &quot;keeping up&quot; in one area or another. Whether it be stupid mistakes a person would make while driving, or listening to the redundant and useless questions the person in front of you in the checkout line is asking the cashier, I&#39;ve found these sorts of incidents more aggravating than I had found them prior to starting TAK.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Spelling</strong></p>

<p>This one is kind of weird. While I am certainly more articulate on TAK, my spelling has gotten worse. It is not that I don&#39;t *remember* how to spell the words that I knew how to spell prior to starting TAK; it is that I make typos noticeably more frequently.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>EDIT: Corrected &quot;types&quot; to &quot;typos&quot; in last paragraph. The irony.  </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Adding &quot;Gaming&quot; section</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. Perhaps more hair-trigger firing of glutamatergic neurons interferes with what would otherwise be a fine-tuned system? That&#39;s my hypothesis for the spelling mistakes. Perhaps more sensitive excitatory receptors isn&#39;t always good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t notice an effect. I used the advised dose which might just have been inadequate, but larger dose is too expensive for me. </p>

<p>Idra-21 has worked for me with significant improvements, despite potential comparative hypothetical downsides which I can&#39;t sense/measure. </p>

<p>Idra-21 is super cheap, but is harder to handle sustainably due to its long duration</p>

<p>I don&#39;t use idra-21 now tho. Often when used I did it like 1-2 weeks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had like this huge post breaking it down, but than my phone went haywire.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<p>Excitability/excited. Feels like being enthusiastic of the possibilities you percieve resultant from being  overclocked, rather than being excited because of an enhanced sense of interest/reward in a particular thing such as amphetamine does.</p>

<p>Increased energy which feels rather like being amplified in thoughts than by being stimulated towards desire</p>

<p>Increased focus and clarity. Resultant of amplified thoughts over noise. This feels different than stimulants in that you don&#39;t have a tunnel vision towards a specific task which attracts you. Rather it feels like you can see the big picture view of your life. Fractalised into compartments of time, behaviors and imlact. Such that you can integrate it to break bad habbits with ease, as if you instead have lifted that tunnel vision in strategic ways.</p>

<p>Increased motivation because of seeing these possibilities</p>

<p>Visual acuity. Instead of seeing more colors like with cholinergics, here I&#39;d noticable see more, of which I couldn&#39;t catch up as fast in telling you what it is. (Seeing more details happens instantly, but communicating requires to have a longer look on them)</p>

<p>Adverse effect was getting too disinhibitedly wired/scrambled at the end of 2 weeks. This was due to being in such an &#39;excited&#39; state for too long, which happens easily due to the duration. But I think you can fix it with better planning.</p>

<p>Some but not all people online noted being an emotional rollercoaster rather than being in a stable positive excited state. I can imagine that if you are already an emotional person. It really just feels like a big amplificator of you for the most part</p>
