        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello dear, Dr. I&#39;m destroyed. the doctors wrecked me so much with their damn drugs. I had a COVID vaccination in December. and had a headache afterwards. I went to the neurologist and he said I have migraines and I&#39;ve got a triptan. when taking it I became restless and everything in my body tingled. I called my neurologist and then drove there. I told him after the triptan I feel very strong restlessness and tightness in my chest. IT IS ALSO EVERYTHING IN THE PACKAGE LEAFLET AS A SIDE EFFECT. he told me i was depressed, i reciprocated and told him i am not depressed. Then he told me to take trimipramine, it helps with headaches. I told him I&#39;m not depressed. than i took the medikant and drove home. when i took the first pill in the evening as prescribed, my life ended. everything became unreal, I no longer recognized myself, I immediately had an urge to move and could no longer sleep at all. and even became psychotic. I immediately ran to the neurologist who told me he didn&#39;t know about such side effects. I didn&#39;t know what was happening to me anymore. everything was unreal and fake. as if I&#39;m dissolving, derealization depersonalization. when i was there he gave me escitalopram/ celexa in addition to trimipramine and opipramol. and I was getting worse and worse I immediately went to a psychiatrist and told him it was these pills. what happened to me he just upped the doses and told me i have an anxiety disorder. I took the cans and no longer recognized my family, I smashed everything and threw things around. the doctors wrecked my life it went on like this for 2 months until my family took me to the psychiatric ward, i told them the pills wrecked me without a second of sleep or sitting still. with full anxiety anxiety fear and panic 24/7. they told me there that we could get it. they stopped taking all the medication and gave me serequel and aktivan. but nothing got better nothing at all. everything had gotten worse. I deeply despise the doctors who did this to me. I was in psychiatry for 2 months and then I ran away with the drugs atosil, effexor/venlafaxin 225mg Tavor 2.5 mg, zopiclone, Remeron pregabalin/lyrica 600mg I just wanted to die. I am infinitely destroyed. my head is burning and tingling spasms have a severe memory disorder derealization nightmares hallucination fear fear fear fear insomnia i am so dizzy and have akathasia to the point of no more. Now I can say I&#39;m depressed but it&#39;s not me that it is. It&#39;s funny what&#39;s going on in my head. I&#39;ve had 7-10 seizures a day on the meds. and no one dropped them, i kept getting more. when I then I came to a neurological hospital as an emergency. put me immediately pregabalin/lyrica remeron 30mg atosil 60mg. and in the end they only released me with aktivan and effexor/venlafaxin. The fact is that I am now 1 year without venlafaxine and zopiclone 5 months. I&#39;m at zero but nothing improves at all. I cry every day every damn day I hate every minute. And forget everything I did or said 1 minute ago. I come from Germany. and unfortunately I have no more money because I paid all the doctors here with money who have ridden me into the abyss. i really need help i beg you endlessly. I have three children and am married. please please please answer me at least i beg you. help help help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your problems are far too severe for anyone to give you advice here, it sounds like you need to see a psychiatrist and perhaps be admitted again. Nootropics can&#39;t help you, and anyone suggesting you start taking these sketchy drugs with limited research is acting irresponsibly.</p>

<p>Quite simply it is unlikely that a covid vaccine and a migraine drug would cause such damage. Perhaps every med you took after may have made things worse, but these meds aren&#39;t likely to cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>I would maybe see about getting some brain imaging like an MRI scan if you&#39;ve not already had one. If you have been prescribed anti-seizure meds it&#39;s important that you continue to take them as prescribed. It will take time, but if you seek proper help you will likely improve.</p>

<p>I know you don&#39;t want to hear this, but it sounds like you have serious mental health issues, and you need to seek professional help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you keep a journal, to make notes of the ways you feel?</p>

<p>Daily entries will be helpful, but it&#39;s great to write as much as you feel comfortable and able. It can even be basic quick notes if you do not have the time or feel good to write lots of details.</p>

<p>Mark each entry with the time and date. Record any medication and supplements (the name, and the strength of the dose) you have taken. Also record your food/dietary intake for the day. And maybe too the activities of your day, and if notice any activity that makes your body/mind feel better, feel worse, or become uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Making a journal of how you feel, along with the active medications, and an outline of your diet and activities, will create a very useful and reliable reference point for any future discussions with people who may support you. Whether it is on the professional side or privately with family and friends.</p>

<p>You will also have a safe space to express in the moments, and create a foundation of information from &quot;in the moment&quot;, each day, to stay informed and make possible understanding of what is happening in your life.</p>

<p>Journal keeping is very useful for looking back, and then planning ahead. Just a few words to make the record of how you feel, on a date and time, along with related people/places/things involved, may make a difference.</p>

<p>It is supportive and valuable as a tool to validate and verify your experience - you will build your case day by day for your own knowing and for showing others when needed.</p>

<p>This may be especially helpful and empowering as a tool over time if your memory seems to be, not where you want it to be, with recall (which is understandable when living with stress and other conditions.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took antidepressants for four years, which also did a lot  more harm than good. It took a long time to recover. It&#39;s not as bad as your story. But I can still understand how you feel. I also lost many years of my life to it.
I can tell you that if you don&#39;t take any medications at all and have a healthy lifestyle, your brain will slowly recover. Proper diet, exercise, a few certain supplements and daily meditation are helpful. Meditation is very good. It has a very healing effect on the brain and absolutely no side effects.
Of course, you must also completely abstain from alcohol, caffeine and other drugs.
I recommend you the book &quot;Head strong&quot; by Dave Asprey. The book is about how to heal your brain and improve your cognitive abilities.</p>

It’s normal for strong antidepressants to cause tingling and derealization and anxiety when the dose is too high or when you taper off and especially when you go cold turkey.
