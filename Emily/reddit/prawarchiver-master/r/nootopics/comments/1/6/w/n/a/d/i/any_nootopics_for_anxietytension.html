    <div class="md"><p>Best thing has been a homemade tincture of Valerian root, passionflower, skullcap and lemon balm. Works almost too well for anxiety, restlesnness and sleep when taken at night. Very easy to make. Can make a tea too or buy a tincture. </p>

<p>Taurine is great too and L theanine. Picamilon is also worth checking out. Lithium orotate too. </p>

<p>Phenibut for once every week or two max. Preferably every 10 days or so max. </p>

<p>Sceletium might help too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenibut is great killer of especially PTSD anxiety and just within few hours it rebounds back stronger than before as effects of substance slowly turn upside down, and ultimately your mind is attached into that sort of thinking when doing a binge on phenibut and of course after that you are more locked into that mindset of looping nasty memories than you were before starting to do it. Overall effect of some usage period on that matter is only negative outcome. </p>

<p>Cannot be labelled as a nootropic, since there is no sustainibility of any kind. Does not fit into Corneliu criteria of nootropics.</p>

<p>People may have personal response, but I have insane tolerance on anything gabaergic and that means how rebound effect actually matters more during usage than short-lived effect itself. And then worse than that, but better I dont start explaining it here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/carebear6590">/u/carebear6590</a> I&#39;m sorry anxiety is a challenge for you. Been there. </p>

<p>NA Selank or NA Selank Amidate is perfect for anxiety. Intranasal. </p>

<p>I saw Bromantane mentioned and it may be helpful but works better for fatigue. It might actually amp you up so please be careful with that.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend Carnosic Acid. CA is very safe and well tolerated. It has so many amazing properties including anxiolytic, anti inflammatory and even has anti bacterial properties. It&#39;s often used to help people get off benzos. Every Chem sells it in a powder. No pills. </p>

<p>If you are into bio hacking a calming device like Sensate or Pulsetto is awesome. I have both. Pulsetto works the best for me. </p>

<p>I work in a brain specialty clinic and am a 2x long Covid survivor and no more anxiety. Reach out if you need help.</p>

<p>P.S. Theanine and magnesium are fair for mild anxiety but with your anxiety I wouldn&#39;t even go there. It&#39;s not enough to tackle it. üôèüèº</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately lack of official literature is not sufficient to base risk appetite off of, for a number of reasons in this case.</p>

<p>Sure Ashwagandha has been around for years, but only recently has it exploded in popularity, along with far more potent products/standardized extracts. With the increase in popularity of the herb and the higher potency, it is only logical that if there were potential for an issue that more individual cases will arise which we are seeing anecdotally. It will take time (years and years) for these to be documented in literature, and frankly most of these will never be documented.</p>

<p>I suffer from PSSD, a condition very similar to what Ashwagandha can cause except worse (it is possible there could be similar mechanisms at play). </p>

<p>Having inadequate literature in the past did not stop me from getting PSSD. Now more and more literature is coming out about it and validating its existence.</p>

<p>This is not to say that everybody that takes SSRIs or Ashwagandha will develop persistent/permanent side effects. It will be a minority. However the existence of the possibility is more than enough to warrant offering every single person wanting to take either the decency of having informed consent in making their decision as to whether to take them or not.</p>

<p>If I had known there was even a 1/10,000 chance of what happened to me happening to me (in reality the odds are dramatically higher than that)  I would have chosen not to take what I took. Instead, here I am 15 years in suffering every single day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your reasoning, but PSSD&#39;s supposedly transient form was described in the literature as case reports very early on. It was later discovered that long lasting manifestations can exist. </p>

<p>By contrast, there is only one case of a short-term manifestation of PSDD-like symptoms described in Ashwaghanda&#39;s literature despite this effect being watched for by proxy in some trials. In fact, ashwagandha has specifically been tested for IMPROVING sexual function in men and women with positive results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use many of the things already mentioned for anxiety but also I work to upregulate gabba receptors by using things like ginkgo bilopa, bacopa and lions man mushrooms. This counteracts the negative effects of anxiety based therapies. Essentially when you use anxiety therapies like magnolia bark or xanax it tells your brain you don&#39;t need as many gabba receptors which over time will make your baseline anxiety worse. Don&#39;t use an antagonist and agonist on the same day however. I usually use the upregulating (antagonist) therapies at least a day or two after using the downregulating (agonists therapies). Also I use downregulating therapies as little as possible. Ashwaganda, magnessium and l- Theanine I use the most often.</p>

I like the CBDmD softgels that have 1mg of THC and their 2.5mg THC tablets.  Also, there is a company called Discreet that does 2.5mg THC and higher CBD in a sweet tart-like tablet that absorbs in your mouth so it kicks in fast.  I like it because it doesn&#39;t get me high but takes the edge off quickly when I need it.   All of those brands are available online and can ship to you without having to go to a dispensary because they are natural and from hemp for what that is worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what he means is that if your life has plenty of real anxiety inducing components going on, looking for an exogenous substance to make it go away isn&#39;t a proper long term solution. Although I agree with that point, I do think anxiety can make it so that we can&#39;t tackle these anxiety inducing conponents well. Therefore, the proper solution is to find something to make the situation manageable, with the intention to work through the anxiety inducing components, once your mind is calm enough to process them and find real solutions.</p>

<p>This is why brain boosters tend to work well for anxiety. It&#39;s not that a boosted brain feels no anxiety, but rather that the boosted brain organically finds better ways to approach the anxiety inducing problems, reaching solutions that reduce the anxiety. </p>

<p>Hopefully, I wasn&#39;t too far off.</p>

<p>If u have anxiety and it‚Äôs affect your mind and body it‚Äôs gonna be harder to conquer those situations in life your struggle with or take them on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, pharmaceuticals that treat anxiety and depression are very rarely supposed to be taken indefinitely. They are supposed to be tools that allow you to do therapy effectively as therapy is the only real solution. No drug or supplement is ever going to work through your problems for you. In fact, people should be more scared of finding something that allows you to stay in this dysfunctional state, more so than they are scared of how difficult the therapy or inner work will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely makes sense. Probably more complicated than this but I simplify it a mixture of neurochemical (hormones/neurotransmitters) and psychological (that inner/innate piece you mentioned). </p>

<p>I started on a med to address the neurochemistry portion because you can‚Äôt really get your serotonin and such back into balance through mental willpower. Then once your anxiety is more in check, you are better situated to dig in on the inner issues and address external factors that your mind/body doesn‚Äôt react well to. Highly recommend going to therapy for the inner work, it helps immensely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean compounds that improve your brains ability to handle and process information. Some examples are things as simple as caffeine, or as complex as neuropeptides (Semax, selank). Many of these will improve activity at the prefrontal cortex, increasing your ability to analyze your situation and come up with a game plan. Many will also improve BDNF or NGF, increasing your brains neuroplasticity, essentially improving your ability to creatively solve your problems with NEW solutions. There&#39;s various other pathways but you get the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>magnesium glycinate is the best thing ive found. there is powdered forms which can be dissolved in water. but double check its pure magnesium glycinate. a lot of the brands will claim its pure but when you look at the ingredients it also contains magnesium oxide, which is inferior in comparison to magnesium glycinate. the other thing that kinda helps that another person here mentioned is passionflower/valerian tea. i sometimes drink those types of teas to help me sleep and it actually makes a noticable difference. passionflower effects the benzodiazepine receptors which increases the effect of GABA, and it also works as a mild MAO inhibitor. i havent looked up how valerian works but i know it also increases the effects of GABA, and magnesium also works on GABA, but it also blocks NMDA receptors which also can be helpful for anxiety</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenibut is great killer of especially PTSD anxiety and just within few hours it rebounds back stronger than before as effects of substance slowly turn upside down, and ultimately your mind is attached into that sort of thinking when doing a binge on phenibut and of course after that you are more locked into that mindset of looping nasty memories than you were before starting to do it. Overall effect of some usage period on that matter is only negative outcome. </p>

<p>Cannot be labelled as a nootropic, since there is no sustainibility of any kind. Does not fit into Corneliu criteria of nootropics.</p>

<p>People may have personal response, but I have insane tolerance on anything gabaergic and that means how rebound effect actually matters more during usage than short-lived effect itself. And then worse than that, but better I dont start explaining it here.</p>
