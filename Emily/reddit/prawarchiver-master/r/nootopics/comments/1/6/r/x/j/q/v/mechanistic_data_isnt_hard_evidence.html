(You may skip the first paragraph if you&#39;d like)</p>

<p>Paragraph 1
As the title states, mechanistic data is used to generate hypotheses not be acted upon.
These hypotheses are used to conduct clinical trials to establish a greater understanding of the system (the human body). Especially with pharmaceuticals in relation to neurology, there&#39;s very little understanding of the brain in its totality. General life advice, there&#39;s 2 types of evidence empirical and mechanistic. Empirical is evidence from observation. Mechanistic is evidence derived through following a chain of causality using past empirical observations (following a chain of cause and effect till you reach a desired point) to then repeat the process. In order to prove something you must first generate a statement and attempt to prove it. Humans, unlike computers, don&#39;t have the cognitive capabilities to continually cross out failed explanations. Rather, humans look for evidence which confirms their hypothesis. However, humans are heavily biased and we often look in the rear view mirror rather than behind us.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2
The problem occurs when people are generating significant life choices, ie taking substances. These substances they take often have very little evidence in regards to saftey. Especially with novel drugs like AMPA positive allosteric modulators, there&#39;s empirical evidence to prove saftey (phase 1 clinical trials) but we shouldn&#39;t use these to confirm our hypothesis that the drug is safe. When there&#39;s a lack of evidence in relation to understanding a system in its totality, you should never draw definite conclusions. In the field of medicine it&#39;s generally accepted that with our current understanding of the system (the body) it&#39;s not definite that drugs are safe. This is when you weigh the balance of harms and goods. When a drug has more harms than goods it is not prescribed. For example, cancer, chemotherapy has a vast side effect profile: shortened life span, decreased IQ, etc but, these harms don&#39;t out wiegh the good of being alive. Now in relation to nootropics, there&#39;s no definite conclusion to whether the substances are safe (generally), and the benefits often aren&#39;t very great, and when they are great, they should be doubted as to their actual benefit as the human brain is heavily biased. People who take amphetamine believe that their IQ is increased but, often it actually impairs it. To conclude, I believe that people should be more risk adverse prior to taking these substances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is saying TAK-653 is safe only because it&#39;s a selective AMPA PAM, because I know that&#39;s what you&#39;re referencing. It&#39;s safe because the preclinical rodent and non human data proved its safety and it did really well on phase 1 clinical trials. If you&#39;re going to try and raise a legitimate criticism towards it, you should be more specific as to what you&#39;re actually concerned over instead of making blanket statements and giving opinions.</p>

<p>Using phase 1 as a standard for nootropics is good because this is a massive leap from preclinical. Not only is this make or break for a lot of drugs but it also shows confidence in the development team. </p>

<p>Is there a percent chance that something can go wrong with larger scale human studies with hundreds of people? Sure. But far less likely than with something that hasn&#39;t even been given nor passed phase 1 clinical trials.</p>

<p>Furthermore the selectivity to the AMPA allosteric site was meant to rule out seizure induction and cognitive impairment specifically. It is proof of concept by Takeda, and there&#39;s not much more you can do to prove it at this point.</p>

<p>Until we can get it to the point that pharmaceutical companies can profit from selling nootropics, we have less to go off of. I can&#39;t tell you how many potentially great drugs I&#39;ve had to leave behind due to no phase 1 trials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t attempting to cover up a criticism of a specific molecule with a blanket statement but I can 100% see how you&#39;d see that from my above statement. I was more using it as an example because it&#39;s well known within this community and it&#39;s quite novel. I agree we&#39;ve gotten a lot better in creating testable premises through past mechanistic data which was in turn found in the same way. This sort of process is how science progresses. However, I disagree with the idea that TAK-653 should be used for recreational purposes. There&#39;s simply too many unknowns compared to unknown benefits. For example, methlyphenidate has been widely prescribed and there&#39;s been a wealth of data. However, until recently there&#39;s been this wide acceptance that Methylphenidate is simple and mechanistically easy to explain in relation to its benefit to adhd. It&#39;s quite convenient when a substance is simply a silent antagonist of just DAT and NET. The mechanistic consequences are easier to find since there&#39;s less confounding variables. However, even after years of past epidemiology there&#39;s been many conflicting examples of a not so simple methlyphenidate. Also, beyond nootropic effects some of these substances could have negative effects which we can explain mechanistically and have been observed. I&#39;ve noticed especially in these past few months that people are heavily biased and lead lives filled with logical contradiction. We avoid the unknown dangers of some activities but will engage in others. Although this is simply a belief, I believe drugs to be quite similar, the data isn&#39;t there yet for us to be using substances for improvement. Also, mice and rat data often poorly translates into humans. Also, there&#39;s many statistical problems in small clinical trials of less than 200 people. You need to look at quality of outcomes not of quality of mechanics. If there&#39;s no quality of outcomes why take the risk?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re to assume you&#39;re still talking about TAK-653 there is a study where it improved cognition in healthy people. And there are studies with other ampa pams where they improved cognition in healthy people, repeatedly, with other drugs.</p>

<p>Methylphenidate isn&#39;t a silent antagonist at DAT, it is an inverse agonist like cocaine which is why it releases dopamine in scale with dose and can cause conditioned place preference to the extent it does.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making a comparison between Methylphenidate and tak-653 but the difference in scientific advances between when it was created and tak are insane. There&#39;s a massive time gap. Everything has improved since then and predictions have improved with them, but we have more than predictions to go off of as well. So logically it doesn&#39;t make sense to make that your example.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying we can explain consequences mechanistically but haven&#39;t given any examples and that also contradicts your overarching statement that drawing a relationship of data from a mechanism is bad.</p>

<p>You also generalize nootropics saying there isn&#39;t a wealth of data when for some of them that are decades old there is. For example Piracetam, CDP-Choline and D-Serine.</p>

<p>The definition of nootropic as per Corneliu implies that it must be safe and low in side effects, so if something contradicts that, then it is no longer a nootropic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize I was sort of working off the presumption that when referring to nootropics we meant substances people on reddit call nootropics not it&#39;s actual definition. For an example of a mechanistic explanation for side effects: atomoxetine was observed to be correlated with sudden cardiac events and was hypothesized to be acting in potassium channels and when tested it turned out to be correct and it extended to analogs of atomoxetine as well. The point I was making with methylphenidate is that for years it was assumed to be a silent antagonist but turned out to be an inverse agonist. Also, it has been found to have some relation to NMDA causing a NMDA dependent agonism of the Sigma 1 receptor likely contributing to its addictive potential and increased calcium channel opening. What if TAK-653 is similar where we only look for evidence to align with the much better fantasy of allosteric modulation. However, while I have you here I&#39;ve found continually conflicting answers on this question. I have a side question as well which is different from the current topic: wouldn&#39;t chronic adensoine antagonism lead to a chronic D2 agonism subsequently causing a downregulation of the D2 receptor thereby reducing basal dopamine levels and, arent the D1 receptor family supperior anyway making the A1 receptor a better target? I do believe that TAK-653 to be the most promising of all substances but there&#39;s little to no data on it from independent companies. Also, I&#39;d worry about the AMPA&#39;s relation to mTOR since mTOR is associated with reduced life span. However, this is all correlation.</p>

Unless you&#39;re fixing a problem ie ADHD with stimulants or depression with SSRIs then the risk to reward ratio with most if these substances is quite poor. There&#39;s evidence of effectiveness in the human construct of intelligence, in relation to medications like methlyphenidate, with a vast saftey profile, with vast quantities of empirical evidence. Yet people invest money and time to improve an already functioning system with a great unknown with a vast danger profile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s wrong to assume that people seeking to optimize brain and physical health are just doing it for superficial reasons.

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I don&#39;t believe that brain optimization is built upon superficial beliefs, the inplication was uncessary if thats what you were intending. Also, i agree that there will be an inherent risk in all actions within this world.

    <div class="md"><p>In your analogy, you say “if your car is working perfectly fine” doesn’t translate because most people using nootropics are trying to treat some symptom. The use of nootropics isn’t purely recreational. It would be nice if we could all just go to our doctors and ask for nootropics, but obviously the current medical establishment is not built around that.</p>

If you&#39;ve read any of my previous posts you would&#39;ve noted &quot;fixing an otherwise working car&quot; this translates to me talking about people with a working undamaged cognitive faculty. Don&#39;t attempt to win an argument by deconstructing a strawman when you know what I&#39;m attempting to get at. It&#39;s a defensive strategy. Once again, if your car is working perfectly fine and you had only a superficial understanding of cars would you attempt to improve the car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m disagreeing with the premise that not having a diagnosed disorder means that you have no issues. A person may legitimately seek symptomatic relief even if it doesn’t fall under the umbrella of ADHD, OCD, or something else that a doctor would give you a prescription for.

    <div class="md"><p>I could see how you&#39;d get a false dichotomy from what im saying. I do agree that there&#39;s a spectrum in relation to disorder. But we can agree that along the line of healthy to disorder that what I&#39;m referring to is healthy. I didn&#39;t create a disanology. I&#39;m talking about in relation to systems. A car has a spectrum of working perfectly and not working perfectly. When I&#39;m referring to perfectly in relation to cars I hope you can extrapolate that into humans. Here I&#39;ll give you a premise if you find something wrong with it let me know.</p>

<p>A car is a system
A car can be objectively efficient
A car can be objectively inefficient but otherwise still function
I have a superficial understanding of cars
Should I modify my efficient car to make it better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the comment, the point I&#39;m making goes beyond merely proving saftey within clinical trials. Also, those medications are used to treat specific conditions, they each arguably have a greater benefit/disbenefit ratio. However, the point of my post above was to establish that when making a change within a system, to attempt to improve it, without any evidence of an improvement, without evidence of potential harms, or without an understanding of the system in its totality, has a greater danger/benefit ratio and should not be proceeded. It&#39;s like attempting to improve a car with a superficial understanding of the vehicle itself, it&#39;s a lot easier to find a problem and reverse it rather than solving future problems or improving the system as a whole. That&#39;s the reason pharmaceuticals are used to treat conditions rather than prevent them. Through empirical evidence, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to find a chain of causality and establish a mechanistic explanation for a treatment in such a complex system with a vast array of variables. There&#39;s greater room for error in changing a system with uncertainty. This means that side effects will go overlooked, benefit is difficult to determine, etc. It&#39;s far easier to fix a problem within a broken system because as soon as you do you see it running correctly again, but when adding something to an already functioning system you need to find a chain of causality to find a benefit.</p>
