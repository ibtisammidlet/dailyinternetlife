Then like 3 hrs later I took another spray but this seems to have made me feel worse. I felt more anhedonic, blunted and even nauseous. </p>

<p>Its been 3 days now and its only gotten better slightly. Still feeling horrible and worried about going back to baseline.</p>

<p>Is this a side effect and does it resolve soon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had the same effect from Selank/NASelank, which always confused me considering it’s MOA tackles a majority the possibilities that lead to anhedonia.</p>

<p>When looking at it with monoamine/catecholamine-centered thinking, it wouldn’t cause the issues that it did— but now after some years of added studies and being back to a functional mental norm, it turns out it’s effects on bolstering GABA and inhibiting NMDA function were to blame.</p>

<p>Adding this reaction with your previous post regarding worsening from MAOi’s and stimulants is basically a full stop at your anhedonia/ADHD resulting from hypoglutamatergic tone.</p>

<p>I would try 2.5/5mg of Micronized Pregnenolone sublingually in the morning (enhances dopamine and NMDA/mGlur1 function) and/or Neboglamine, and 600mg of Nootropic Depot’s NAC with the above and/or before bed (only mentioning brand since it’s the most potent and least oxidized I’ve consistently found on the market).</p>

<p>NAC was the first thing that brought back a glimmer of my personality and a functioning reward system— which is ironic considering I always stayed away from it from accounts of it blunting emotions and dopamine. It restores proper function to glutamate antiporters and the NMDA system as a whole, and Nebo/Preg direct and enhance activity through that system to make sure it runs smoothly on its own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks this is really informative. But if the issue is <em>hypo</em>glutamatergic tone then what explains GABAergics like Klonopin or ca channel blockers like pregabalin giving me relief from anhedonia? Wouldn’t these be decreasing glutamate?</p>

<p>I take 50 mg preg daily but its not the micronized sublingual kind its just a regular oral preg. I wonder if brand also matters for preg. I haven’t noticed much from it. </p>

<p>Yea ive heard the same about NAC which is why I always stayed away but it would be ironic if it helped me. </p>

<p>Whats also weird is while TAK653 helped me a couple times (but now does like nothing), Ketamine at a 1 mg/kg dose worsened my symptoms for a week. Thats an NMDA blocker and usually Ketamine is supposed to help. I wonder if I just didnt get the AMPA effects from its metabolites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m taking Bromantane, methylene blue and have been on those for a while. Is there some interaction with these?</p>

<p>For me yes stuff like stimulants (except brom) are often blunting, but in a different way than this felt. This felt like a serotonergic type blunting and I did get more blunted on a few days of Nardil (initially it had helped) but that went to baseline a few days after stopping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bromantane makes me feel out of touch and anhedonic for a long period after taking. Almost finishing a bottle of nsi helped a bit until I took more bromantane and came right back.</p>

<p>Also I noticed while taking methylene blue it felt good while on it then all of a sudden my tolerance jumped and I felt worse off of it. I don’t think messing with maoi and catecholamines is good for a longer period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it the spray Bromantane? Do you mean right after taking it you feel anhedonic or you feel anhedonic after a long period of taking it Its the only stim thing that actually helps my anhedonia somewhat. All other stims result in more emotional blunting. I suspect it’s because Bromantane is dopaminergic and GABAergic</p>

<p>Lot of people take way stronger MAOIs than MB and are fine. But MB does build tolerance I noticed. I couldn’t tolerate Parnate or Nardil due to blunting more but I only tried the former 2 days and the latter a week and it was more blunting too except initially big relief for Nardil. </p>

<p>Theres not much to treat anhedonia out there.</p>

<p>Theres a peptide MIF-1 which I cycle and that provides great relief while on it but I haven’t managed to reset myself with it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is the spray and no I would say I would feel its effects slightly first which is not much tbh and then its anhedonia afterwards that hangs around indefinitely unless I try to take something else to combat it. </p>

<p>The only thing that’s really brought light to me for anhedonia was stimulants and serotonergic things. And mushrooms like lions mane. Psilocybin would be ideal for anhedonia as well as most of my other problems but it is not legal and readily available to order like other nootropics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stimulants just seem to make me very robotic which worsens anhedonia, its benzos for me which help remove the anhedonia aspect though they don’t bring back emotion.</p>

<p>For me I wasn’t feeling this bad prior to NA selank so I think its just that. I seem to have had a nightmare reaction to it or some interaction</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bromantane and selank is a great combination personally, I doubt there&#39;s a negative interaction. It&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that the interaction comes from methylene blue. MB on its own can cause serotonin syndrome, while selank either decreased or increased serotonin levels in the types of mice it was tested on. It&#39;s unlikely an interaction between the two has been studied, and given the complex (and not fully understood) mechanisms of the two of them are quite vast.. maybe it&#39;s a bad mix for some people? You might be best off discontinuing the methylene blue until you feel better in that case.</p>

<p>If it doesn&#39;t go away seek healthcare, bring documentation and information about what you took, and ask about the possibility of serotonin syndrome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS usually has physical issues right?</p>

<p>But yea maybe MB and selank, although at the doses of MB I am taking (about 40 mg a day, split up in 3 divided amounts ) it should not really be acting much as an MAOI I think.</p>

<p>Itll be hard to dc the MB as its helped me with my problems a lot and still does. It mustve just been something with selank or it interacting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a short close call with it I think. I felt nausea, a weird persisting yawn feeling, stomach issues, sleep deprivation, anxiety, poor mood, and confusion.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I see yea I had that yawn feeling the first day and the nausea then too. Also bad mood although that part of it all has resolved, just the added blunting hasn&#39;t. Though I was dealing with blunting before a well it seems to have been aggravated.</p>
