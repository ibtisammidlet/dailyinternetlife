    <div class="md"><p>Minoxidil shortens the telogen (resting) phase, thus increasing the anagen phase (hairgrowth), whereas BDNF/TrkB shortens the anagen phase via raising transforming growth factor β2 (TGFβ2), resulting in a faster catagen phase (early hairloss). </p>

<p>Finasteride indirectly has a similar mechanism compared to minoxidil, by ‘pushing’ hair follicles (impacted by DHT) from the telogen into the anagen phase and/or anagen phase prolongation via its 5AR-inhibition/DHT-reduction. (‘and/or’ because the exact mechanism of DHT on hair follicles isn’t fully known. Same counts for minoxidil)</p>

<p>In vitro, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15322193">catagen induction by BDNF was partially reversible through co-administration of TGFβ-neutralizing antibody</a>”, so it can be somewhat reversed. However, I don’t think the practical application of the neutralizing antibodies is realizable.</p>

<p>But I think the effect of BDNF/TrkB-induced hairloss in the presence of the hairgrowth and hairloss-prevention effects from the Minoxidil and Finasteride combined, will be negligible after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compounds that counteract TGFbeta and increase growth factors like IGF-1 I suspect would help counteract this. Minoxidil would definitely help as it is a strong hair agonist. Bimatoprost is also a strong addition (PgF2alpha agonist). This shifting from anagen to catagen by BDNF occurs downstream of the androgen receptor. Finastride by itself I would not expect to do much, except to reduce a compounding induced by androgen receptor activation in the scalp.</p>

<p>I started looking into TGFbeta traps, but this is very new ground. Not sure I can recommend using Luspatercept for mesotherapy.</p>

<p>Anyway for me  7&#39;8-dihydroxyflavone and its superior synthetic derivative both seem to have initially significant nootropic, mood enhancing and motivational effects but heavy tolerance develops within days and is seemingly persistent.</p>

<p>Do you find its effects consistent ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed a decrease in the intensity of its effects, after continuous usage, that does indeed seem persistent. However I&#39;ve seen many people recommend cycling it with polyglala, or just taking polyglala with it to mitigate this. I haven&#39;t cycled 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF  this way, per se, but I did take polyglala for a couple weeks during a time when I didn&#39;t have 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF due to financial constraints. The next time I got some, after finishing the polyglala weeks earlier, I did notice much more intense effects from the 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF, akin to what I experienced when taking it the first couple of times I purchased it.</p>

<p>I would also recommend Magnesium L-threonate for any male pattern baldness issues, and that&#39;s in addition to its myriad cognitive benefits. It would be the only kind of magnesium I take, if it weren&#39;t so expensive.</p>

<p>Sorry I don&#39;t have the links to any of these studies, but they aren&#39;t too hard to find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t reply or see your comment for some reason but got the notification.  I am looking to try 4-DMA but am already taking finasteride and minoxidil for hair loss. I am just weary of making the problem worse. But if TrkB agonists are causing hair loss through a hormonal mechanism/ 5a-reductase/DHT, I&#39;d imagine the finasteride would counter it. But then that leads me to wonder if it would counter any of the benefits too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve taken 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF on a 5 on, 2 off cycle for probably at least 3 months. Was alternating with polygala on the weekends to mitigate the possibility of TrkB downregulation.</p>

<p>Currently taking a break from both due to recent changes to my psych and gastro meds, as well as part of an effort to reexamine the usefulness and/or need for what I take.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t aware of an issue with hair loss, but I did not experience anything noticeable. It seems that the growth of my hair has slowed in general (nothing extreme and I could be wrong), but I just assumed that was age. I&#39;m about to turn 39.</p>
