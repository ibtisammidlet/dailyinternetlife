        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>After semi-chronic and adolescent THC use I developed some frustrating lasting side effects including; social dissociation, aphantasia, and depression. Shortly after that I abused nutmeg (I know) and developed HPPD, Learning difficulties, and further intensified my social overstimulation &amp; dissosciation. <strong><em>This self inflicted damage is why I got into nootropics</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> After detoxing THC with fasting and exercise for a month. I decided to try microdosing DMT, which helped my HPPD and anxiety in the past. But this time I&#39;d add TAK and see where it takes me.</p>

<p><strong>Dosing Regimen / INFO</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Extended-duration micro DMT doses after a highly social day. I dosed 4 times in 2 weeks. I took 3mg TAK in the morning before the social event and would vape DMT around 4 PM.</li>
<li>On microdose days I would vape very small amounts of DMT while playing the guitar. I took 3-5 baby hits in the span of 30-60 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have microdosed DMT in the past without TAK and I can say it&#39;s very different and less noticeable. Through out the week where I was microdosing with TAK I noticed a number of interesting lingering effects;</p>

<p><strong>Week 1</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Noticing potentiation of TAK&#39;s typical benefits; introspection, analyzation and most pronounced now -- Antidepressant boost</li>
<li>During these social events I could see through and break down the complexities of social interaction.</li>
<li>My favorite result of this experiment is more social involvement. It got rid of my tendency to dissociate from stressful interaction</li>
<li>My &quot;inner-eye&quot; or visualization skills dramatically improved, it really helped my weed-induced aphantasia</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Week 2</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I now notice my HPPD is <em>altered</em> but not worsened. It was just as staticky but felt more <em>beautiful</em> and less <em>glitchy</em>.</li>
<li>At night I practice inducing CEVs with my eyes closed. These are fun to explore. Dreams are wild and serve as automatic premeditation.</li>
<li>Because of my staticky HPPD I could <em>almost</em> see my visualizations with my eyes open if I tried hard enough. After practicing I found I could actually see a string or rope tying people to phone&#39;s, people, etc..</li>
<li>I could see a visual manifestation of the way I interpreted the dopaminergic attachment to their surroundings.</li>
<li>Now this may sound delusional but I was fully aware it was a hallucination, and one that I actually had to force myself to see.</li>
<li>I can sense a god-complex forming because my state of awareness made me realize how many others are not aware.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Week 4 (Now)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My 1st TAK bottle is gone and I&#39;m on my second. I discontinued DMT after the second week</li>
<li>These open eye visuals faded but my analytical and introspective skills remain</li>
<li>Antidepressant effects are just as strong and I&#39;m still more outgoing and confident socially</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The TAK made me very sensitive to the cumulative effects of the DMT. Typically DMT micro dosing gave me a mild afterglow but never kept me in a semi-psychedelic state like this experiment definitely induced.<br/></li>
<li>I feel more stable now and my mild God-Complex has faded. It never became a problem but my ego had been lifted when I was able to break down and quantify social patterns so easily</li>
<li>This was an overall positive experiment but next time I will reduce the frequency of DMT dosing</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Great nootropic it pairs well with TAK, never did much to confidence or social interaction for me but it&#39;s a great mood boost</p>

<p>Honestly the best thing I got out of this experience was the visualization boosting. I&#39;ve noticed that it really helped my ability to learn and integrate knowledge by watching and visualizing.</p>

<p>Before this, I was limited to learning by physically doing the task myself while I&#39;m given instructions. Now it&#39;s far easier to listen to what someone says --&gt; visualize --&gt; integrate before I even start the task</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I avoid it due to potential Liver-failure / toxicity &amp; other side effects. It&#39;s method of action is counterproductive for cognitive enhancement due to it being a GABA-A PAM.</p>

<p>In addition to this, iirc it&#39;s neurotoxic to combine Gabaergic drugs with AMPA PAMs. I&#39;m not trying to ditch my beloved TAK so that&#39;s another reason why I&#39;m not interested</p>
