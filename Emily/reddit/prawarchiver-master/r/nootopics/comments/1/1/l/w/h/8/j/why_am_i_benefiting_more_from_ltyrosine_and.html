        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On L-tyrosine and Rasagiline (MAO-B inhibitor), I get improved cognition in terms of creativity and recall, which is very obvious when having conversations with people. On stimulants such as ritalin and coffee, I feel quite tense and zombified, with a bit of memory loss (tip-of-the-tongue effect).</p>

<p>My history includes the chronic use of SSRIs and TCAs, I wonder if that has lowered the usual amount of dopamine produced in my brain, which is why L-Tyrosine and MAO-B inhibitors work well, but not DRIs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only estimate it&#39;s because of the lack of norepinephrine stimulation from rasagiline compared to Ritalin and coffee. But also different brain regions that are affected per drug as explained next.</p>

<p><strong>MAO-B</strong> is mainly localized in the thalamus (medial and lateral geniculate bodies), caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, hippocampus and to a lesser extent the Prefrontal Cortex (as a whole).</p>

<p><strong>Ritalin</strong> mainly affects the inferior frontal cortex (middle and inferior frontal gyri), basal ganglia (as a whole), and cerebellum</p>

<p><strong>Coffee</strong> mainly affects the lateral prefrontal cortex, the DMN, visual cortex, and motor network. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious as to what these differing regions have to do with how they affect you, just let me know and I can edit to provide this info.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong><em>A few things to say about that</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>MAO-B</strong> being located in the hippocampus, thalamus and mPFC (as opposed to just the lateral PFC) are to great extent reasons for why you experience increases in cognition, memory/word recall, and creativity. Even though only about 30% of dopamine is metabolized by MAO-B, that&#39;s still plenty when in the right locations. Having said that, some people still get no effect from MAO-B inhibition for various reasons I won&#39;t get into here as this is fairly long already. </p>

<p>Ritalin being a reuptake inhibitor just keeps dopamine and norepinephrine from being taken back into the synaptic vesicles a while longer. But if your brain (assumingly) isn&#39;t producing enough dopamine in the first place, or is breaking it down before the transporter can take it back, there tends to be a lack of therapeutic effect. </p>

<p><strong>Caffeine</strong> though doesn&#39;t increase dopamine. It just makes dopamine receptors &quot;more sensitive&quot; to put it simply. But it does increase norepinephrine a whole lot. More so, coffee increases serotonin a good amount which for some can cause anxiety or reduce linear cognition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the maoi combo with a supply of dopamine raw material allows your brain to function more ‘normally’ just with boosted dopamine levels. Over shooting that therapeutic window and increasing brain activity in multiple regions combined with too much dopamine, from stronger stimulants, can change your state of mind considerably and impact cognitive function for the worst.</p>
