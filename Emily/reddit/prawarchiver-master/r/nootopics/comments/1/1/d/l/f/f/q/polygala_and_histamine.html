        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried Polygala and I like it since it helps with overthinking and mild anxiety.</p>

<p>The only downside I&#39;ve got is that it seems to *<em>raise histamine</em> (I&#39;ve already have high histamine levels) and I get itchy scalp.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestion to avoid/minimize this side effect?</p>

<p>Maybe pairing Polygala with something that decreases histamine, such as <em>stinging nettle leaf, holy basil, reishi or quercetin</em>?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Polygala isn&#39;t known to raise histamine levels. It&#39;s been shown to reduce the effects of overactive histamine response by reducing dermatitis and subsequent itching actually.
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/1/190">https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/18/1/190</a></p>

<p>What I think you might be sensitive to is the large increase in acetylcholine that polygala causes. In which acetylcholine overload can cause hypersensitivity to contact with skin that causes the urge to itch. And given the hair on your head is continually brushing the scalp, it can cause a lot of itching.
It&#39;s actually a problem I have too when my acetylcholine levels get too high. (Like right now while on a cycle of ALCAR).</p>

<p>The only real way I can suggest to test this is by using something that reduces acetylcholine, like a low dose forskolin or higher dose kava(both speed up the breakdown via AchE), or something to increase dopamine a good amount (one that doesn&#39;t also increase Ach)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, interesting insight. Yeah I think I have high acetylcholine levels, this could maybe also explain my <em>high REM vs low deep sleep</em> issues.</p>

<p>I could do a trial with kava before sleep. </p>

<p>Forskolin looks interesting too, but I&#39;ve seen somewhere that it could cause fatty liver. </p>

<p>IIRC Alpha Lipoic Acid could lower acetylcholine, but I have yet to understand if it could move metals around in the body, and I&#39;ve seen a few reports of hair loss.</p>

<p>Do you have any supplement suggestion for increasing dopamine while not increasing acetylcholine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mention it. It would explain intense rem sleep as well as you said. Pros and cons to that as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware. </p>

<p>The fatty liver issue is dose dependent, but only seen at higher doses of whole CFE used in testing(250-1000mg). Even if that&#39;s only standardized to 10% as I saw in one study, 25mg forskolin is much more than needed for AchE activity. 
Honestly 5mg-10mg forskolin is all that&#39;s needed. Only downside is that it does cause much more rapid up regulation of AchE even when taken every other day.
<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/4/866">https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/4/866</a>
 So maybe kava is a better choice long term as it does raise dopamine as well. Some people report noticing a strong effect to energy and motivation and others just notice mild anxiety relief. 
Honestly though the capsules are not best route. If you do use kava I&#39;d look for a sublingual tincture, much more effective and effects are noticed within 15 mins.  </p>

<p>ALA is honestly something I&#39;ve never dug into much unfortunately so I won&#39;t pretend to have insight on it.  </p>

<p>The dopamine increase is a 2 edged sword though. If you&#39;re going to use kava, you have the potential to hit both points, and it works fairly well at doing what you need. I say that from literature as well as from personal use of it for basically the same reason as you. So I would start with kava and then branch out from there. A lower dose can help without causing any sedation or dysphoria.</p>

<p>Otherwise for dopamine without any acetylcholine you&#39;re mostly looking at things that would cause tolerance to build quickly if taken every day (like catuaba, licorice root). Or pharmaceuticals that have other actions as well (like selegiline, aripiprazole, clonidine). Or things that can cause toxicity when used unwarranted like higher vitamin d doses.</p>

<p>Quercetin has potential though if you are someone that responds well to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wholly forgot, bromantane would be a solid addition for increasing dopamine without any discernable tolerance. Taken with l-tyrosine of course.
But that would be a morning thing and potentially wouldn&#39;t help at night after wearing off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, very interesting insight!</p>

<p>I have some Kava from Nootropics Depot, so I could do a trial with it and then maybe try a tincture. Do you have any brand to advise which ships to Europe?
A few questions if you don&#39;t mind:
* Is it better to take during the day or before sleep?
* Is it necessary to cycle it?
* Does is stack well with polygala?</p>

<p>Regarding polygala, is there any supplement which has the same MOA but doesn&#39;t boost acetylcholine thus don&#39;t cause scalp itching?</p>

<p>That&#39;s interesting about quercetin, I didn&#39;t know it raises dopamine. I&#39;m investigating it since I&#39;ve read that it could help with high histamine/hay fever and undermethylation too.</p>

<p>Do you have by any chance experience with <strong>royal jelly, Cordyceps and Maca?</strong>
Do they boost dopamine? I&#39;ve read somewhere that Maca is an FAAH inhibitor so maybe it could help with my overthinking/worrying issues. </p>

<p>A little OT, but since you have a deep knowledge, do you know any supplement to help with fast COMT? </p>

<p>Last but not least, do you know any legit source for Bromantane in Europe?</p>

<p>Sorry for all these questions, but these topics are pretty complex!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about the delay. Just started a cycle of Dihexa and it made me spacey for a couple of days. </p>

<p>Because I realize my response is going to be long, I&#39;m not including links to research articles that purport my comments solely because I&#39;m technically working and don&#39;t have the ample time. But if you want them, I can edit to attach later tonight or tomrrow.  </p>

<p>I unfortunately am not knowledgable on EU specific vendors, but I can say that I got mine off of Amazon. Natures Answer Kava-6. After trying 3 different capsule versions (to the extent of trying 10 grams of one with no effect), I found that this tincture finally gave me effects. I will say though that I haven&#39;t tried any other tinctures besides that one. To help you know if it&#39;s good, remember a proper tincture extract should leave your tongue a little numb after sublingual administration. So make sure that reviews of one you choose have that mentioned. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are taking it to lower ACh due to Polygala, then you should take it in conjunction as Kava duration of effect is only roughly 6 hours. So dose as needed, there aren&#39;t any purported tolerance reports and the studies point to reverse tolerance. So find a dose that works, but isn&#39;t high enough to be too relaxing or cause any sedation.</li>
<li>Cycling isn&#39;t really necessary as said above given it&#39;s known to cause reverse tolerance, but I had never found if that was specific to the gaba effects or other mechanisms as well. So I&#39;d say take a day off a week or so. You&#39;ll also be able to gauge if it has lasting effects on these off days. </li>
<li>I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t stack well with Polygala. Many of their effects can be seen as potentiating, besides the mix of nmda antagonism and gaba upregulation. But that also honestly depends heavily on specific brain chemistry as those could be a god send for some and a little too mentally blunting for others. </li>
<li>To tack on to this most importantly, you should eventually have down regulation on the acetylcholine effects of polygala. So within a few weeks to a month the itching should subside even without an adjunct like kava. </li>
</ul>

<p>- And I am not aware of any individual substance that has the direct same effect as Polygala, with or without the ACh effects. It being a triple reuptake inhibitor is fairly unique. You&#39;d have to utilize a few different things to get all 4 of it&#39;s main perceived effects.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Quercetin</strong></p>

<p>My only qualm with quercetin is it can cause uv sensitivity. When I did a run of it a few years back, it did help with histamine stabilization, but it caused me to get sun poisoning. I&#39;ve always been a quick tanner and don&#39;t ever burn. But I got ruined by the sun hah. To be fair, This was right after winter in Illinois and I was then down in Louisiana and spent 12 hours a day in the sun for a week straight. So your mileage may vary. </p>

<p>There is actually a whole lot of new research on Quercetin that I have not looked into, but it&#39;s showing that there are a lot of different mechanisms in play, so for this specific use case I would avoid it just to rule out different possible actions.</p>

<p><strong>Royal Jelly, Cordyceps, Maca</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Royal jelly I have not had any experience with or done much research on. </li>
<li>Cordyceps I use to use and have a large amount of research into. Getting a real extract of it though is necessary as most out there are not the same as what is used in all the research(grown on caterpillars is needed). There are 2 or 3 brands that are solely recommended for Cordyceps with RealMushrooms being the one that has the most positive feedback. As far as what it does, It is a short acting MAO-B inhibitor, but also has a few more mechanisms that go on such as CREB regulation, EGF, mTOR... That&#39;s something I&#39;d recommend you look into because me explaining their connections here would be a whole article on its own. Most importantly though, Cordyceps has a bell curve. Too much and it generally just makes you tired. Too little and you don&#39;t really notice anything of course. </li>
<li>Maca I use on spare occasions solely for in the bedroom. While it is an FAAH Inhibitor, it&#39;s not very potent at this in the CNS and is mostly worthwhile if you want to increase the size of your load lol. If you look up synthetic FAAH Inhibitors you will understand just how intense the effect is in the brain. Other that that, it reduces cortisol, and can increase Dopamine and Serotonin as shown in a few studies.  The majority of mechanisms for maca are still fairly unknown. For me, i just get lethargic if i&#39;m not exerting energy. But for my ex, it worked well to reduce anxiety and bring up her mood. Black and red maca are said to be the best, but honestly it really depends on the person. It is definitely worth trying though if you haven&#39;t yet. Just note that most research uses dosages of at least 4 grams, while most people online seem to only take 1ish gram because that&#39;s what random supplement bottles say to. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>COMT</strong></p>

<p>Rhodiola is the most well known COMT inhibitor and does a great job at it. There are 2 sides for it, with rosavins and salidrosides being its main components. Some get better effect from extracts with higher salidrosides while others get better effect from higher rosavins. That will be wholly dependent on you. </p>

<p>There are also some studies that say Quercetin inhibits COMT, but again, you&#39;d have to look into alll the mechanisms to see if it&#39;s something you think would work well for you. </p>

<p>Other than those, EGCG is the only other natural worth mentioning. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Bromantane</strong></p>

<p>I feel i would be doing a disservice if I didn&#39;t say the best place to get it is from everychem. com (use to be bromantane. co). Created as a nasal spray so it has better bioavailability and ease of use. It&#39;s the only place you can get a nasal spray version. The creator of this sub reddit is actually the one that owns EveryChem. Very reputable, and prices much better than most sites. They are located in Florida but ship overseas and have quick shipping times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks SO MUCH man for the extensive feedback! All clear and very interesting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with kava and polygala and then test the other supplements later on, starting with cordyceps and quercetin. The latter in particular seems interesting because it could also help with undermethylation issues.</p>

<p>One last thing (I swear lol): what do you think about <strong>MSM and Reishi mushroom</strong>?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that MSM could help with many things, also high histamine and undermethylation. Is it true?</p>

<p>Regarding Reishi, I&#39;ve stumbled upon it when I was investigating medicinal mushrooms; I&#39;ve read that it could help with hay fever and immune system <em>modulation</em> (I have an autoimmune skin condition, so I don&#39;t want to boost the immune response).</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m concerned about potential anti-androgen effects. Besides lowering DHT, can Reishi cause also gynecomastia? 
Maybe stacking it with Cordyceps, Cistanche or Shiljait (which if I&#39;ve understood well raise DHT) could do the trick? There&#39;s also creatine, but I&#39;ve seen some scary hair loss stories...</p>

<p>Thanks man!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mention it. A lot of why I finally decided to join and participate on reddit is because there are a lot of people on here that just kind of give random info that isn&#39;t usually true.</p>

<p><strong>MSM</strong> can be very hit or miss. Your body produces some naturally, so you&#39;ll only really see major benefits if you are low on it. If you eat/drink a lot of nuts, vegetables, milk and eggs, then you are most likely getting enough and won&#39;t see major benefits. The few studies that have been done are fairly inconclusive given short durations and small sample sizes unfortunately. It&#39;s not purported to reduce histamine, but it&#39;s believed to reduce the suppression of the immune system when under stress. This would allow your body to fight inflammation better which is the assumed general reason for reduction in allergy symptoms.   Reishi is honestly far better for all things that you are interested in. </p>

<p><strong>Reishi</strong> as just said is great for controlling allergies<strong>.</strong> There is a vast amount of studies about that as I&#39;m sure you know so I won&#39;t get into that. And it&#39;s &quot;anti-androgen&quot; is solely towards DHT. It inhibits 5-alpha-reductase fairly substantially. (up to 80%). Because it blocks the conversion of Testosterone to DHT, it actually increases serum testosterone levels. It&#39;s been used in research to fix sexual dysfunction. Having said that, higher serum testosterone can cause more to be aromatized to estrogen, but this has only been an issue with a small subset of people. If you currently have high testosterone and/or estrogen levels then it would have more potential. But this is also dependent on your levels of SHBG. If you&#39;re worried, I&#39;d just get a hormone panel run. Idk your age, but once you hit 30 it&#39;s good to have that run every year anyway just to check.</p>

<p><strong>Creatine</strong> is good if you&#39;re wanting to put on some weight while utilizing it&#39;s neuroprotective effects, but otherwise not worth it. I use it for amphetamine protection/tolerance as well as added (water) weight, which it does help, but if I get dehydrated at any point, taking a dose makes me anxious and jittery. As far as DHT goes, I can&#39;t confirm or deny it mostly because I have a hairline that has been receding slowly since I was 21 (currently 33) because of genetics. But there is potential that caused it to accelerate as I started using creatine back in college and more so have used it ever since with a few years break here and there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome thanks again, you rock!</p>

<p>Reishi looks interesting, I&#39;d give it a go, maybe pairing it with Cordyceps.</p>

<p>I&#39;m M37, I took hormones panels two years ago and they were fine, prolactin a little high but MD told me that it can be caused by stress. I&#39;m going to test again in the following months. Luteinizing hormone (LH) was in range but on the lower end, maybe because I have varicocele? </p>

<p>Do you think that, in order to minimize the risk of gyno via aromatization, I should take a natural aromatase inhibitor,  or it&#39;s not necessary? I&#39;ve seen that <strong>apigenin, stinging nettle, pomegranate and luteolin</strong> could help in that regard.</p>

<p>Also vitamin E seems good for lowering estrogen in males.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t attempt to correct a problem that hasn&#39;t yet occurred honestly. Given you don&#39;t know how your body will react or what your current levels are, I&#39;d just use Reishi and if you eventually notice a problem, then move to correct it. Always best to add one thing at a time so you can dictate what effects you are getting from it and what may need to be added or removed. </p>

<p>As for Vitamin E, it&#39;s more of a band aid. It doesn&#39;t lower estrogen levels even though its claimed to be &quot;anti-estrogen&quot;. It just prevents the toxic/negative effects of high estrogen levels. Although, low levels of Vitamin E have shown to reduce testosterone levels, so supplementing it can help in that regard. I&#39;d have Vitamin E levels checked when you get your next hormone panel done as well.</p>
