Can I just boil the glass then spray some isopropyl through a bit then spray some boiled, filtered water through it and be ready to use with cerebrolysin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I tried CBL very recently. It&#39;s the most potent nootropic I&#39;ve taken, and I can see why it has the highest probability of being life changing. It feels like my brain was brought a little back to teenage years, and all these ideas and thoughts came into my head. I felt like my potential was boundless once again. </p>

<p>However, the only way to do it is intramuscularly. Anything else and you risk permanent brain damage - it&#39;s simply not worth it. No matter where you are now, I guarantee being a vegetable is worse. </p>

<p>The reason why intranasally is so dangerous is because it&#39;s so close to your brain. In fact, if you go swimming in the lake, it is significantly less risky to drink the lakewater than it is to get it up your nose. This is because there are brain eating amoebae that go up your nose. The nose is an incredibly delicate structure that can detect individual molecules. You don&#39;t want to be jamming a small quantity of CBL into there when it&#39;s never been tested and so close to your brain. </p>

<p>I stopped it after a few days simply because the injections were a pain in the ass (haha). Overall, I would recommend it if you are really looking for something to change in your life and you are not worried about the risks because you have little left to lose. Cerebrolysin, as tested and safe as it is, is still a drug that we know very little about. You are effectively injecting a bunch of random peptides that have never been sequenced before into your body. These could cause immune reactions and tumorgenesis. The risk of the drug is proportional to the number of users, and CBL has very few users globally. </p>

<p>To be frank, it seems you are dead set on taking the leap. I would just say - don&#39;t be a bitch, do the injection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Additionally, when you are doing it intranasally as a spray, you are getting 0.2mL if you spray in both nostrils. Even if you do that 5 times, you are only getting 1mL. Actually thinking about it, it&#39;s a decent amount lol. So if you spent an hour sniffing you could probably actually make something happen. If my rant did nothing, and you do end up doing it intranasally, let us know what happens lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is more than enough, because the peptides get transported to the brain directly, so it doesn&#39;t have to enter systemic circulation first and then be diluted. There&#39;s even a paper on intranasal use in humans and this pathway. Tons of people on Discord server do it and are all completely fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard that consistently it&#39;s very dangerous to dose cerebrolysin through the nose. The nose is a vector for brain damage. Additionally, the quantity that would be a normal daily dose, 5cc&#39;s, would be far too much. If you must avoid the injection, do it sublingually</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually didn&#39;t have a bad experience Intranasally. Also know other that&#39;s done it for months and they&#39;re perfectly fine. I think personally i prefer the IM just bc of the therapeutic effect it has on the body too.</p>

<p>Yes injecting can get annoying after some time but it also depends on the needle. I&#39;m using a 30 gauge needle so barely leaves a mark and usually painless. I also switch between my thighs and delts and triceps.</p>
