        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone, </p>

<p>I’ve always been a heavy coffee drinker. Love the taste, but also absolutely need it for the focus &amp; energy for my job.</p>

<p>I love experimenting with mixing my coffee with nootropics &amp; adaptogens to keep the taste and the focus but minimize the side effects, and am contemplating putting a product together and selling it to people who’d be interested.</p>

<p>I want to validate that people would be interested and also gather some info about what would matter the most to a consumer of this product. </p>

<p>Is anyone interested in jumping on a 15 min call to chat a bit about what a great product would look like? In return for your time, I will Venmo you $10 at the end of our call or give you a free 30-day supply when I launch. Your choice. Only requirements are to be a heavy coffee drinker and be from the US.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, just comment below or book some time on my Calendly: <a href="https://calendly.com/nourmoustafa/focusedfeedback">https://calendly.com/nourmoustafa/focusedfeedback</a></p>

<p>Thanks fellow biohackers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard of bulletproof coffee? It seems like they may have something pretty similar.  </p>

<p>I personally like l-theanine with my coffee (150-200mg per cup). I&#39;ve heard taurine is great too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ll be looking for three things then: cost, tolerability, and taste. In other words, it can&#39;t be too expensive, it can&#39;t have a high risk of side-effects, and it shouldn&#39;t be off-putting in taste. I&#39;ll give some suggestions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vitamins</em></strong></p>

<p>B-Vitamins: use the <em>active</em> form of B-vitamins, as these are more readily metabolized. Some people have issues metabolizing the inactive forms, so by using the active forms, more people will notice more of a boost from it.</p>

<p>Choline Supplements: a moderate dose of a choline supplement such as CDP-Choline or Alpha-GPC would be good.</p>

<p>L-Tyrosine: this is a lot less likely to have an effect, but it&#39;s cheap and won&#39;t ruin the taste, and some people who have a deficiency might notice a difference. N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine would be a more bioavailable form, meaning you&#39;d need to use less of it. I don&#39;t know what its taste is like, though.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also ALCAR, which would provide more stimulation. But it has a bitter taste and a dosage of 0.5-1.5 grams. It&#39;s cheap, though.</p>

<p><strong><em>For Side-Effects</em></strong></p>

<p>Three options: L-Theanine, Taurine, and Glycine. Taurine is the most popular option, probably because it&#39;s cheap and has a good taste. L-Theanine might be more effective than Taurine for aiding focus, and I&#39;m not sure which is better for calming jitters. Glycine helps some people feel relaxed and to sleep better. Not sure how it would do in an energy drink.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alternative Forms of Caffeine</em></strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s alternative forms of caffeine that supposedly have less side effects. Theacrine is the one that&#39;s usually mentioned. I&#39;m not sure about the price, but you could look into it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nootropics</em></strong></p>

<p>Noopept: not the best option overall for a nootropic, but it&#39;s really cheap and really well tolerated. You can add just a bit, like 30mg, and it shouldn&#39;t affect the taste.</p>

<p>PRL-8-53: I mention this one because it&#39;s well tolerated, like noopept, and it shouldn&#39;t cost too much either.</p>

<p>Tropisetron: this would be good for focus. It&#39;s also cheap and won&#39;t affect taste too much, like the others. Only issue is it causes constipation for some, and might have some med interaction, so I&#39;d look into the pharmacology a bit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of other options you could consider, but these are the ones that immediately come to mind.</p>

<p>By the way you should know that this subreddit is r/NooTopics, whereas the main nootropics subreddit is r/Nootropics (with an r after the t). This subreddit is more focused on experimental nootropics and is centered around a business (<a href="https://everychem.com">everychem.com</a>). You&#39;ll get weird recommendations from people here. r/Nootropics, the larger subreddit will give you more standard recommendations, probably a lot of herbal supplements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll assume this is going to be packaged in a can somehow. In that case, I personally wouldn&#39;t ever pay over $10 a can. Maybe once, but not if it&#39;s something I&#39;m having regularly. Anything over $7 I would consider closer to &#39;not worth it&#39;. Anything under $5 I&#39;d be much more inclined to buy.</p>
