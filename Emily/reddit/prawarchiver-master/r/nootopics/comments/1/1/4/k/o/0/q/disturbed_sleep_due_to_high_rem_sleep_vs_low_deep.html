        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>Since some time, I&#39;m having this issue.
I&#39;m not having nightmares, but vivid dreams that cause many &quot;micro-wakeups&quot; during the night.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really waking up (and I have no problems in falling asleep) but my deep sleep is affected and I get too much REM sleep. Fitbit seems to confirm this.</p>

<p>Is there anything that can help? Somebody in the past adviced <em>agmatine</em>, but AFAIK it raises histamine (I already have high histamine levels).</p>

<p>I have a theory that maybe the cause could be <strong>too much acetylcholine</strong>. Does it make sense?
However, that would be odd, since I&#39;m taking an anti-histamine daily (for an autoimmune skin disease), and AFAIK antihistamines <em>lower</em> acetylcholine.</p>

<p>Another theory is that it could be caused by some kind of <strong>brain inflammation</strong>, since in the past, when I took Ibuprofen before sleep (for other reasons), my sleep seemed to improve. But maybe it was just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds very similar to me. I can wake up, up to 20 times per night ... It&#39;s a state of extra vigilance, ie. anxiety which could be caused by the autoimmune thing you have going on. How&#39;s your gut health?</p>

<p>Conversely, the only thing that helps for me are H1 antagonist&#39;s. Nothing helps as much as they do. Not even benzos. So it&#39;s a matter of increasing sleep pressure and decreasing REM, increasing SWS. Unfortunately H1 receptors desensitize rather quickly, so it&#39;s not a reall solution to the problem, but it goes to show that histamine is a problem. </p>

<p>Considering you have a histamine problem (how do you know this?), it makes sense. No magnesium, inositol, p5p, etc. bs is going to make an appreciable difference here, I&#39;m sorry. This are just the most common layman internet recommendations everybody gives.</p>

<p>Histamine receptors are very tightly connected to wakefulness and in fact, is what narcoleptics have problems with. Modafinil, for instance, increases histaminergic tone. The orexin system, which is the system responsible for wakefulness, works via the histamine system.</p>

<p>So my advice for you is to work on your histamine issues.</p>

<p>And what will work for you as a band aid is to increase your sleep pressure via H1 antagonists. </p>

<p>Also, how are your iron levels: transferin saturation, ferritin and iron?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your feedback man.</p>

<p>Besides having hay fever, bloodworks showed that I have high histamine and also high homocysteine. 
High histamine is also compatible with an  undermethylation profile, which I think I have since I have many symptoms.</p>

<p>If high histamine is the root cause, why Cetrizine before bed does not solve the issue?</p>

<p>What do you think about stinging nettle leaf? IIRC it&#39;s a natural H1 antagonist.</p>

<p>Do you have any experience with the following supplements for solving our sleep issues? <strong>Agmatine, reishi, CBD oil, nigella sativa</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Also, from wiki: <em>Cetirizine crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier only slightly, and for this reason, produces minimal sedation compared to many other antihistamines.</em></p>

<p>Histamines agonizing histamine receptors in the brain is the problem, not in the periphery. Try something that crosses the BBB a bit more like diphenhydramine or ketotifen, mirtazapine, trazadone, etc ...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have exp only with CBD and it&#39;s going to help as much as relieving anxiety helps but in of it self, 5-HT1a agonism is contraindicated for sleep. One of the reasons why SSRI&#39;s are bad for sleep. However, in the case of too much REM, it might be useful to a degree, as serotonin lowers REM sleep. But it&#39;s only a band aid at best and it&#39;s also temporary as HT1a&#39;s downregulate rather quickly. But CBD can also raise glutamate signaling, which will make you dream even more. Anyway, no harm in trying it out.</p>

<p>Dual orexin antagonists is the next hype sleep drug. Check those out.</p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of ways. Checking blood DAO levels is a good way. Otherwise I&#39;d suggest reading about histamine problems and see if you can relate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure. Modafinil is a popular option, but it regulates other system besides histamine/orexin too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m way too smooth brained for this group so mostly here to learn lol</p>

<p>But in my experience, CBD oil zonks me right out &amp; most nights I don&#39;t dream so I figure its deep sleep. I feel rested next day. Sometimes I dream &amp; hit REM tho. (I don&#39;t track it) 
I use Redecan CBD reign drops for $15 a bottle which last a month. Apparently there is other discoveries called SBD oil which is more specifically to aid sleep but its pricey. ($70)</p>

<p>As for the taurine, in my &quot;quackery&quot; research it suppresses MSG in the body which is a root cause of fibromyalgia. I took it with probiotics &amp; also a tsp of apple cider vinegar in water each day to promote gut flora health and was able to cure my fibromyalgia which when triggered I would feel 90yrs old. Fibromyalgia is a bandaid label for over 2000 auto immune diseases according to womans college hospital, which focused on naturalist solutions, they also taught me about the FODMAP diet &amp; avoiding high lectin foods &amp; chemical exposures....so some food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High REM sleep can occur due to Ach overload. </p>

<p>You can also have overmethylation which is responsible for Ach synthesis. </p>

<p>I would advise you to check how you react to cholinergics (neck muscle spasms, anxiety, poor sleep, fatigue, brain fog, depression, anhedonia) if you have DNA test done you can check SNP&#39;s for choline metabolism and methylation.</p>

<p>I removed all cholinergcs from my life and added Forskolin and Bromantane which decrease Ach. + take non methylated B complex and avoid methyl donors such as Creatine,TMG</p>

<p>Sleep much better know :) </p>

<p>Just dont bother with antihistamines, long term damage is not worth it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm forskolin is easy to find in most sport suplement shops, you can try with dosage from CILTEP stack or higher. </p>

<p>Bromantane is another story... Newmind is a proper soruce but you need to login and fake yourself as &quot;researcher&quot; to be able to buy. Hydrapharm is also legit but extremely expensive. You can find DIY made bromantane on ebay, allegro etc. But their purity might be big drawback. </p>

<p>As far as I know bromantane (ladasten) in tablet form is not produced in russia anymore. </p>

<p>Kava kava is less strong than forskolin in Ach inhibition but ocassionaly you can try it! I just don&#39;t recommend kava kava longterm it&#39;s a potent Gabaergic, on &quot;Gabagoodness&quot; reddit you can find a lot of scary withdrawal histories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you got tested/ruled out for MCAS?</p>

<p>Sounds like you very well could have MCAS or something connected to your mast cells (I read that you had problems with acetylcholine supplements which is something I always have had), when it comes to that, first getting it diagnosed/ruled out is step number one, if you have it then make sure to remove all possible triggers for mast cells like high histamine food, histamine liberators food, supplements, mold and etc.</p>

<p>Then you should start on a mast cell stabilisers like Cromolyn (High dose vitamin D (20-30k IU per day + 1000-1500mg of magnesium is also another great mast cell stabilisers and also great for sleep problems).</p>

<p>For neuroinflammation, Cerebrolysin is the shit, 10ml for 10 days had a very clear impact on my deep sleep (I have MCAS and also had too much REM sleep with waking up too many times during the night), and I could feel after 48 hours that my neuroinflammation had clearly gone down (which is what studies has shown with microglia cells), and everytime I have been able to quit something I have been addicted to as well, another clear sign of decreased neuroinflammation and neurogenesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, very very interesting. Yeah I have undermethylation symptoms and high histamine levels so that could be a culprit.</p>

<p>Besides vitamin D and magnesium, do you advice any other natural supplement to address MCAS? Do you have any experience with Andrographis or Luteolin?</p>

<p>Here is a great site for all possible natural supplements and other things you can do. Haven&#39;t tried a lot yet as I am right now trying to remove triggers and finding what causes them or not, interestingly hormones such as DHEA and anabolic steroids like DHT-derivative seems very interesting but obviously not natural supplements lol.  </p>

<p>But make sure to get it checked out before starting treatment for it, don&#39;t want to treat this if the cause is actually something else but it does sound a lot like MCAS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Proper MAOIs eliminate REM sleep. People start to have the REM waves during wakefulness though. Also, it comes back somewhat in a few months of treatment.</p>

<p>I think, weaker MAOIs and other antidepressants have the same effect, just not as pronounced. Back in a day i accidently got on like 1.5g\day RIMA moclobemide, and then quit it cold turkey. Then for a few days i was having a few vivid nightmares a night. They were starting immediately after i fell asleep. Always ending in my death, which woke me up shaking. Then i would fall asleep again, die again, wake up, fall asleep, die again etc etc. That was crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Garlic :)</p>

<p>Garlic is good stuff for healthy people. Stronger than most people think. Not strong enough for real depression, in this case a proper antidepressant is required. And when it comes to antidepressants - nothing beats tranylcypromine. It&#39;s like the sun compared to all those &#39;lightbulbs&#39; people usually get prescribed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How can i know if my histamine levels are high or low?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lot&#39;s of ways. Checking blood DAO levels is a good way. Otherwise I&#39;d suggest reading about histamine problems and see if you can relate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, can i take some supplements to increase wakefulness via histamine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Modafinil is a popular option, but it regulates other system besides histamine/orexin too.</p>
