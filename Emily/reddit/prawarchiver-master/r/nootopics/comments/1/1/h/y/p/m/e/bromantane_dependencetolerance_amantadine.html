        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey! So I&#39;ve been reading up on bromantane and it seems very interesting. In a way too good to be true even.</p>

<p>I am wondering if anybody knows how the increased dopamine production through TH (and thus also it&#39;s release) affects the expression of dopamine receptors?</p>

<p>In my mind, the body will counteract this increase in dopamine through downregulation of dopamine receptors/reducing the dopamine sensitivity. 
Can anybody explain how bromantane apparently does not cause de-sensitization and thus no tolerance or dependence and withdrawal?</p>

<p>I am trying to raise my baseline of dopamine sensitivity for social anxiety, and would rather not have to rely on substances to do so. Hence, the apparently long-lasting effects of bromantane and ALCAR seem very intriguing to me.</p>

<p>Another question of mine is how bromantane compares to amantadine in it&#39;s dopaminergic effect. Amantadine has a long track record of safety in humans, so it feels &quot;safer&quot; to try amantadine, if it elicits similar effects.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TH isn&#39;t the interesting part, it&#39;s just one aspect to how it works/ downstream event. If you want to read in detail about how it&#39;s sensitizing to the dopaminergic pathways, here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/</a></p>

<p>It seems GDNF and kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition are the main things responsible for its persistent dopaminergic effects. Also amantadine and bromantane are most similar (with bromantane seemingly more stimulating, possible due to less NMDA antagonism), and the safety of bromantane isn&#39;t bad as it has been shown repeatedly to be safe in clinical and preclinical studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I will go though it!</p>

<p>Why do you think bromantane is considered superior to amantadine? As far as I know amantadine could also interact with potassium channels, however at a concentration 3 times higher than generally seen serum concentrations (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901515/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901515/</a>). Is it known that bromantane has a lower IC50?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bromantane hasn&#39;t been given a modern assay but <del>while the concentration for Amantadine used was 3x more than therapeutic</del> (<a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/133398">it wasn&#39;t, he&#39;s wrong</a>), it would explain other things, such as the reduction to inflammatory cytokines, increase in GDNF &amp; improvement to dopamine receptor sensitivity and normalization of ON and OFF time in parkinson&#39;s. Since Bromantane reduces work errors/ frequency of attempts in contrast to syndocarb/ mesocarb (a DRI), it suggests resensitization of inhibitory medium spiny neurons and thus normalized activation D2 receptors in the presence of elevated dopamine. Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition explains the reduced inflammatory cytokines --&gt; indirect inhibition to HDACs (thus increase in neurotrophic growth factors --&gt; C-Fos --&gt; dopamine receptor sensitivity), upregulated tyrosine hydroxylase --&gt; lack of: overstimulation/ noise/ psychosis/ dyskinesia, persistent post-cessation increased dopaminergic behavior, etc. that is seen with both compounds. It&#39;s likely that sigma is involved in both at active concentrations, but it wouldn&#39;t explain the therapeutic benefits for either. The reason Bromantane is thought to be more stimulating is in part mediated by the possibility of less anticholinergic and dissociative effects, but also because it was said to be by the Russians who chose it from a laundry list of hundreds of adamantane compounds, of which Amantadine was included. Users who have tried both would anecdotally agree, but there&#39;s also the fact that Bromantane has a much higher LD50 than amantadine.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really interested in Bromantane, it&#39;s up for sale on everychem as a nasal spray, because when the pharmacokinetics were observed for oral vs. IV, there was a 60x decrease in elimination constant (thus diminishing the half life) due to too much fat solubility and lower organ accumulation, as well as a 70% loss from first pass. The brain half life is 7 hours, but it could potentially be reabsorbed from plasma over the course of 10 days when used intranasally, as well as increasing the bioavailability. To achieve what&#39;s seen in some of the studies showing long-lasting effects using injection, this may be necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insights!
Sorry mate, I did not understand the first part of your reply and the subsequent string of explanations.
What are you referring to when you say &quot;while the concentration for Amantadine used was 3x more than therapeutic&quot;? 
What I was referring to, is that in experiments, it was shown that amantadine has an IC50 of 29uM on potassium channels, in vitro. At therapeutic dosages of 100-300 mg, amantadine never had a higher serum concentration in humans than 10uM. That would mean that it is unlikely that it would have any noticable effects on the potassium channels in a clinical setting. 
My question then being - you&#39;re saying bromantane exerts its effects through interactions with the potassium receptors - where can I find data that proves this? Or is this a conclusion from the fact that Amantadine is able to bind these receptors (though likely negligible at therapeutic dosages)?
And again, which studies show that bromantane is superior to amantadine?
Thanks, really appreciate it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As in, how else would both bromantane and amantadine decrease inflammatory cytokines that then reduce HDAC for both compounds? And how else would Amantadine reverse dyskinesia and ON/OFF time for L-Dopa? Everything points back to kir2.1 potassium channels. There&#39;s nothing else to logically explain the effect of both compounds.</p>

<p>Edit: and you&#39;re not even right about it being inactive at therapeutic levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, &quot;how else&quot; and then concluding is not very scientific. At best, it is an educated guess.

<p>Yeah the channels aren&#39;t activated, because they&#39;re inhibited by the compound. Stop claiming it&#39;s not active at therapeutic doses. You had me believing you for a second, but you&#39;re not even right about the dose being incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I&#39;m on the go, and haven&#39;t read the whole article yet.
However, you can see in the first image, bottom right, that at concentrations that are found in human serum (&lt;10 uM), the ion flux is nearly 100%. This is exactly the paper that states that the IC50 value is 29 uM (as said in my first post), three times as high as the human serum concentration at clinical doses of amantadine. There is minimal inhibition at serum concentrations.
Unless there&#39;s anything else in this paper, which I would encourage you to point out, it does not seem to verify that the potassium channels are blocked. 
Also, just as a side note, your tone does not seem very scientific and I would love for us to stay scientific. I am not trying to make anything look bad, I am merely doing my research and am raising questions. If I am wrong, perfect - I would love to be wrong as I find the effects of bromantane very interesting.</p>

<p>I have not strayed from anything scientific. You are claiming dangerous things about Bromantane, with no substantiation in another post, and claiming I am wrong about Amantadine in this one. Therefore I am telling you to stop being erroneous in your conclusions about things, because it&#39;s misinformation. Unlike you I really don&#39;t want to be wrong, I like being right.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not claiming anything. I am reporting what I found in in silico analyses and am asking questions about it. I have never said &quot;bromantane is cardiotoxic&quot; or anything like that.</p>

<p>Yeah, I am not sure what that study is about, but if you check the review paper I linked in OP, you will find that several human studies have found concentrations under 10 uM in human plasma. How that correlates to post mortem brain tissue, is a questionable. Mind, that I have always only been talking about the plasma concentrations in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry. It says it in the abstract. They are looking at tissue. The amantadine concentration there are higher, as amantadine accumulates inside of cells, in the endosomes/lysosomes. (this is also the reason that amantadine can elicit effects on sigma receptors, despite having a high IC50 - these receptors are intracellular and the amantadine concentration are higher there). The potassium channels are on the cell membranes and are in contact with the plasma or CSF, not the lysosomal amantadine. And as you see in the abstract, the concentrations there in the fluids is drastically lower - and lower than the IC50 for the k2.1 channels. It literally says it in the abstract you linked - just read it completely instead of trying to find things that would disprove. Get the whole picture and make conclusions - that&#39;s science. Again: I find bromantane very interesting and do NOT want to make it look bad or anything, just doing my due diligence.</p>

<p>Literally the next sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to brain tissue, amantadine concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum was in the low micromolar range ( &lt; 17 microM). CSF and serum total values were highly correlated to each other and were always lower in CSF. The mean CSF/serum ratio for total amantadine was 0.76. To further estimate the extracellular concentration, amantadine was determined in microdialysates in the rat striatum. At behaviorally active doses, amantadine concentration in striatal microdialysates ranged between 6 and 21 microM. These results indicate that extracellular concentrations of amantadine (CSF and serum values in patients, striatal microdialysates in the rat) are in the range of its Ki-value at the PCP binding site. Amantadine concentrations in brain tissue are much higher, probably due to intralysosomal accumulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you&#39;re saying that the sigma agonism does not contribute to the therapeutic benefits?
This excerpt of the review paper on amantadine I linked above argues against your point:</p>

<p>Sigma 1 receptors Amantadine is a very potent ligand of sigma-1 receptors (Fig. 3, Table ​Table4)4) which has been first described by Kornhuber and colleagues (Kornhuber et al. 1993). These receptors are also located intracellularly, e.g., on membranes of endoplasmatic reticulum and control Ca2+ signaling (Monnet 2005). Sigma-1 receptors enhance tyrosine hydroxylase activity (Weiser et al. 1995), modulate NMDA stimulated DA release (Gonzalez-Alvear and Werling 1995), increase DA in vivo in the striatum (Gudelsky 1995), and decrease DA uptake (Thompson et al. 2001). All these effects may participate in the symptomatologic effects of amantadine in Parkinson’s disease. Sigma-1 receptors have been suggested as targets for neuroprotection in Parkinson’s disease (Francardo 2014; Mori et al. 2012; Rousseaux and Greene 2015). Sigma-1 agonists may be beneficial for: neuroprotection in general (Decoster et al. 1995; Maurice and Lockhart 1997), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Mancuso et al. 2012), Alzheimer’s disease (Meunier et al. 2006), ischemia (Oneill et al. 1995), anxiety (Ji et al. 2017), and depression (Raupp-Barcaro et al. 2018; Skuza et al. 2014). Moreover, activation of sigma-1 receptors may enhance recovery from TBI through increase in synaptogenesis and inhibition of inflammation (Dong et al. 2016; Ryskamp et al. 2019).</p>

It doesn&#39;t cause desensitisation of impacted tyrosine hydroxylase levels. The latter isn&#39;t particularly helpful as many dopamine agents have no issues with their mechanism of action, the issue is in receptor behaviour. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Bromantane is one of the only dopaminergics to show persistent elevations in dopamine after discontinuation.

<p>I’ve got your bromantane spray which I like a lot, but I do feel like I build a tolerance to it over a few days. I feel like if I use it continuously then stop abruptly, my mood takes a nosedive (withdrawal)? Am I actually building a tolerance here? I’ve had a read of all your detailed posts regarding dopamine and D1/D2 receptors but I still don’t fully understand the mechanisms as my knowledge base is definitely below most people in this sub.</p>

<p>Also, ALCAR makes me feel like shit I’ve tried more than once and it definitely affects my mood and therefore cognition negatively. What regime/supplements would you recommend for someone like myself who wants to use and maximise the potential of bromantane regularly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know someone who has been using the spray for over a year and has still not developed a tolerance to the effects. He requires it to combat his PTSD and lack of motivation, and has experienced a drastic improvement to his quality of life ever since he began using it. It&#39;s possible there&#39;s a multifactorial cascade after the administration, and that you favor the acute effects, but in terms of a &quot;nosedive&quot;, or tolerance to the main benefit of the compound, I&#39;d say what you describe isn&#39;t supported by the literature, and may be circumstantial/ dependent on other things in your life. </p>

<p>In regards to ALCAR, some people don&#39;t like cholinergics. Istradefylline is the only other compound I know of that may have prominent dopaminergic effects with low tolerance. Personally I&#39;ve been using ALCAR for over a year and love it, but I felt like it was going overboard at a higher dose as well so I decreased my dose to 500mg/ day a few months ago.</p>

<p>I’ve been dipping into nootropics off and on but wanted to get your input on</p>

<p>Bromantane spray + TAK-653  soln+ Tropisetron soln as a daily stack? What doses would you recommend?</p>

<p>I would also consider doing deprenyl 1.25mg SL no swallow weekly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not true because if it was possible to increase dopamine via the precursor, then bromantane wouldn&#39;t work at all (it creates a stimulatory effect via tyrosine hydroxylase upregulation). Your brain/ body hold a reserve of tyrosine that we get abundantly from the protein we eat. Especially those who are not vegetarian.</p>

<p>L tyrosine was given to people after a high protein meal and it decreased their dopamine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the exact question.  Ultimately, how many times a week should you use the spray ( I take 3x 9 mg sprays = 27 mg a dose ) , twice a day , for 4 times a week. What’s the ideal dosing schedule to continue with benefits, not build tolerance, enjoy the uplift, and not waste it ? </p>

<p>If it continues into the next day , should you only dose once , every other day ?</p>

<p>Is 3x9 mg sprays = 27 mg also too much , given superior bioavailability ? </p>

<p>Would be grateful for advice.🙏</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am currently in the same boat as you (ADHD and currently undermedicated, at least until Monday... pharmacies suck). I think there&#39;s two likely explanations for what you&#39;re describing (which I&#39;ve experienced to some extent, though definitely not tolerance--the acute &quot;rush&quot; isn&#39;t going to last forever btw, but the overall effects remain consistent).</p>

<p>First, it could well be potentiating whatever ADHD stimulant you&#39;re currently taking. As such, when you don&#39;t take bromantane your mood and ADHD may become impaired (esp. if you&#39;re already undermedicated).</p>

<p>The second possibility is that, because you&#39;re already undermedicated, your body just has a rough time adjusting back to the ADHD med you have without the extra boost from the bromantane.</p>

<p>These are educated guesses based on my own experience with ADHD and bromantane, but I feel people are awfully quick to blame bromantane. There&#39;s a lot that could be going on here, frankly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To build on u/sirsadalot comment about ALCAR, dosage is very important. I react horribly to cholinergics and end up tired, unmotivated with a tension headache and itchy. Anything over 200mg of ALCAR just makes me feel like trash. 200mg still makes me feel bland, but it helps with cognition and clarity the following day when I take it at night. I cycle it for 1 week every 2 months and this works best for me. 7 days of ALCAR has been demonstrated to have a sustained increase in basal dopamine levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you sell bromantane....fulfilled my post in 1 shot didn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>I have read the studies and I&#39;ve used it myself hence the answer I gave which I stand by</p>

<p>Edit: I should clarify, I like bromantane, it&#39;s right behind amphetamine for me in terms of effectiveness and far superior to most other nootropics but I do not agree or recommend that anyone uses it non stop or in recovery situations for the reasons above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can sell bromantane and smoke you in a scientific debate. You didn&#39;t read anything, hence why you said so many incorrect things in a single post (and continue to stand by those statements, even though they&#39;re wrong). If you want to go over them in further detail, I&#39;m here. But at least review the post I made first. </p>

<p>Bringing up financial incentive won&#39;t get you out of this. Would you believe it that people sell products and don&#39;t lie about them? I know, shocking. </p>

<p>I mean we&#39;re literally talking about a compound proven to not have a withdrawal syndrome or tolerance to dopaminergic effects; bromantane&#39;s effect literally persists over a month after discontinuation.</p>

<p>Uridine, 9-me-bc, etc. are always being lied about and don&#39;t upregulate dopamine, but Bromantane genuinely does. And like you said, it works.</p>

<p>I just get livid when I see people being so cocky and wrong, especially in such a disrespectful manner. Due your due diligence next time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying the same thing and it doesn&#39;t make sense and the studies you reference don&#39;t show that either. Whether there is a tolerance to bromantane or not is irrelevant, there is always,in my experience, a tolerance to significantly higher dopamine and there are hundreds of studies showing that. The mechanistic effect it has really doesn&#39;t matter, it doesn&#39;t mean the actual impact will prolong. I can only speak from experience as I don&#39;t have a lab with a thousand people. Speaking of which neither do you and I will never buy any supposed truth that a substance can, at the same dose, infinitely raise dopamine significantly, that&#39;s just fantasy. </p>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t preach about cocky when all you are doing is projecting arrogance and disrespect. You don&#39;t have to be an outright liar because you sell something, but profit will make your truth all the more real to you and all the louder in the projecting of it. No point claiming to be impartial however neutral you might want to be. If you want to sit there and sell bromantane as the forever heightened dopamine miracle then go for it, but if it really was that you would be spending less time on Reddit and more time in your 10 mansions...</p>

<p>When it comes to bromantane I actually think the more unique attribute is the combination of anxiolytic and dopaminergic effects. It can sit well alongside traditional stimulants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have this idea that the brain responds the same to every substance. . This isn&#39;t always the case when a substance has multiple mechanisms. Remember we are technically just getting to point in technology where we can start creating compounds that are tailored to the effects we want instead of blanket effects as seen with most first and second gen drugs of any class. But also to a point where we can actually find out all the effects a substance has in the body. There are still studies that happen every year on aged drugs to find out more about what they actually do.  And moreover, neurochemistry is different among different people. </p>

<p>A schizophrenic that takes amphetamine can be sent into psychosis that lasts long after the amph has been cleared from their system. It is so intensely dependent on how a person&#39;s brain is wired. Hence why not all drugs work for every person, as well as why some people have paradoxical effects to drugs. But we do have a benchmark as to how something will work on a majority of people. Just because you may develop tolerance to bromantane, doesn&#39;t mean its the normal. You were just unfortunately dealt genes/polymorphisms that aren&#39;t the best for it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To finish though, most drugs that actually cure, don&#39;t cause someone to need to increase the dose eventually, or can&#39;t be patented, don&#39;t end up becoming prescriptions because pharma is shady and would prefer things that continue to make them more and more money. Otherwise Bromantane, racetams, Lithium Orotate(not that carbonate bs), milk thistle, and others would currently be active pharmaceuticals that are being prescribed.</p>
