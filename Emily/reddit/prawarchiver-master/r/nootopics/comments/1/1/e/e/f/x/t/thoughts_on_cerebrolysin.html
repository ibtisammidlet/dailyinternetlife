In the informal survey on r/nootropics they found that this was one of the highest drugs with probability of being &quot;life-changing&quot; that increase synaptogenesis rather than just being a raw stimulant.</p>

<p>Risks: A study that sequenced all the ingredients found 638 random peptides and growth factors, none of which were known. It seems that the primary risks are autoimmune / prion / cancer risk. Tbh I think autoimmune and prion risks are relatively low as evidenced by the literature, but I could see the tumorigenic effects being significant, especially if these growth factors are binding to random receptors, some of which are oncologic (ie c-Met being an oncogene). In particular curious about your thoughts u/sirsadalot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The prion risk has been well prosecuted. Stay away from the cerebrolysin offshoots that use cattle and youre fine.</p>

<p>Pugs have the odd ability to essentially be immune to pripn diseases , they had to take mad cow and grow it in deer brain and then transfer that to pigs to get it to stick (or somethibg wacky like that) and even then it was like petri dish science. Luterally no natural pig prions and zero instances of pig to human or human to pig prion transfer.</p>

<p>50 or 70 years of use in the EU.</p>

<p>I liked it but I cant help but think the placebo effect is ramped up with this since you have to inject it.</p>

<p><del>Cerebrolysin is stable at room temperature up to 77F. Cellex on the other hand requires cold storage supply chain. I would love to try Cellex despite the cost, but cosmicnootropics can&#39;t provide cold storage shipping for it.</del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything that promotes growth will feed an existing cancer, but crashing estradiol/test/hgh/igf-1 is not healthy.</p>

<p>If your concerned about cancer your best bet is caloric restriction and keeping low but not too low (enough that you have no mental symptoms of deficiencies) levels of androgens and IGF-1 for the rest of your life. Eat keto for rest of life. Not taking anything that increases any growth factors. You give up protection against neurodegenerative disease for the hope of preventing any cancer development. That means no lion&#39;s mane and no nootropics at all beyond stuff that increases blood flow circulation in the brain.</p>

<p>Low dose naltrexone has many anti cancer effects and is much more sustainable.</p>

<p>Not sure I recommend this, but valproic acid titrated slowly, assuming you are not trying for kids, has many anti cancer effects in addition to facilitating a more childlike learning. That is not a pleasant medication and I haven&#39;t tried it myself. I dug through HDAC inhibitors awhile ago aside from tributyrin and eating celery the pharmaceutical options all had some major negative attached.</p>

<p>An alternative approach would be to cycle. A cycle of abundance, bulking, where you increase growth factors and build muscle, run nootropics, etc. Followed by a cycle of restriction: fasting, keto, intermittent fasting, caloric restriction, no increasing growth factors, and the like. My broscience is that this best follows our evolutionary history of having seasons of abundance and seasons of rationing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>probability of being &quot;life-changing&quot; that increase synaptogenesis rather than just being a raw stimulant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that sub is full of people looking for powder that gets them high but is legal addy and can be bought with a debit card. Cerebrolysin and cortexin will not do that, but they are very effective at facilitating a disciplined and structured approach achieving a goal by by increasing a bunch of different growth factors and working through pathways we don&#39;t quite understand. </p>

<p>Increasing neurogenesis doesn&#39;t mean shit if the people involved spend their days playing videos games and on porn. They are just adapting themselves more effectively to a lifestyle that is stagnant. All these compounds are a means to an end. Maybe for some that end is to reduce the risk or delay development of neurodegenerative disease, but for most it&#39;s more sustainable to have short-mid term goals that grow into a long term vision. Being mentally engaged and challenged is a time tested and proven method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for the thorough response! i agree, better to be the candle that burns twice as bright. no particular concerns for cancer, just think it&#39;s the most pertinent risk - but you&#39;re right that all the neurogenic chemicals have this issue. out of curiosity, what stack do u run nowadays?</p>

<p>haha yeah I didn&#39;t realize how much the sister subreddit was a bunch of people trying to get addy. respect the real ones trying to get an issue fixed but i&#39;m more interested in the science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s self explanatory. People with alzhiemers who still have some purpose or drive that keeps them challenged have much slower decay. Their cognitive reserves are much more resilient. Once that is lost, like with losing family and a close partner, there is a rapid collapse of their mental resiliency. Applying this is going to vary across people. Some coders after achieving lots of financial success work on open source projects for the rest of their lives. You have to start by asking yourself, &quot;What do I want?&quot; and slowly build from that answer.</p>

<p>A chemical enhancement stack is  going to potentiate the effort and discipline they are exercising. The general population spends hours doomscrolling looking for some quick fix. Changing your habits to enable delayed gratification long term is a much more fulfilling life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally life changing. Been on it for 3 weeks, and having added it to helminthic therapy (HDC, 3 years -- see <a href="http://helminthictherapywiki.com">the Helminthic Therapy Wiki</a> -- has completely eradicated the insomnia that has plagued my life until now. I can&#39;t emphasize enough how monumental this is. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried every sleep medication, every antidepressant, several different exercise regimens, keto and other dietary modifications, and literally hundreds of supplements and nootropics. Some helped enough to keep around (exercise, magnesium, helminths) and most didn&#39;t. I&#39;d sleep 3 hours, or 6 with numerous interruptions. My body needs 8-9, as I dimly remember from my high school days before the insomnia became crippling.</p>

<p>The first two days after starting cere I was sleeping 8-9 hrs, only waking up a few times. By the end of the first week I had reduced my sleep medications by 25% and was still sleeping well. Memory is much better (digit recall improved from 9 to 12 and still going), energy / personality / interest / focus / drive / sociability / humor / dexterity all at levels I haven&#39;t had since my 20s (42 now).</p>

<p>The heuristic I&#39;ve heard for cere is that it can be miraculous for restoring lost function, but won&#39;t give you anything you didn&#39;t already have before. Can&#39;t speak to the theoretical plausibility of this claim, but it perfectly describes my experience thus far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you trolling re: helminthic therapy? my gut instinct is, understandably, disgust - is there scientific basis to it? What&#39;s the intuitive explanation for the mechanisms that make it actually good?</p>

<p>edit: looked into it, seems like the basic idea is parasites don&#39;t want to be killed - modulate your immune system to be less aggressive. Seems reasonable as a potential treatment for autoimmune diseases and reducing inflammation. </p>

<p>I think my argument still stands though - it&#39;s very much a spectrum. Why not just infect yourself with bacteria periodically? Theoretically, we could say that there exists some mechanism through which we need to &quot;spend&quot; some quantity of a substance to maintain efficacy (ie how ejaculation improves prostate health). Or why not perform periodic bloodletting to reduce excessive iron levels? In the past, I&#39;m sure we bled a lot more frequently, as we got into fights and cuts from various animals. Overall I think the risks of helminthic therapy are probably not worth it, unless you have an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder that is moderately to severely affecting your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>also based on your post history, it seems like you don&#39;t weigh the risks very importantly when making decisions like these. While it might make sense in your case, where your insomnia and depression is bad enough, I think for most people dihexa is _definitely_ something to avoid. In fact, the original creator says it activates a known oncogene, cMet, significantly promoting tumorgenesis. Of course, while all growth factors contain this tradeoff between cancer and growth, I would be much more wary of suggesting dihexa as a valid treatment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So lame that every damn post about these peptides directly or indirectly circles back to the longecity piece…the molecular weight of prions alone would exclude it from making it past the synthesis standards of the peptides. If you’re not willing to do them that’s fine but stop regurgitating stuff you’ve read on some random subreddits by people who haven’t even tried the peptides themselves</p>
