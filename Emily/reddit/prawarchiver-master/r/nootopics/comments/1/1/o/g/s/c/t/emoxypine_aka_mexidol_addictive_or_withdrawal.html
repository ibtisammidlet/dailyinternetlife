        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am still suffering from Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome, nearly 4 months after taking my last Valium (Diazepam), symptoms being severe anxiety and depression. Mechanism of action is downregulated GABA receptors.</p>

<p>I have read really good things about Emoxypine for anxiety and specifically about it upregulating GABA receptors.</p>

<p>My concern is whether it is addictive and/or whether it may cause withdrawal symptoms? Would I just be replacing one withdrawal with another?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: realized I never addressed your actual question! I&#39;ve not experienced any withdrawal or addiction from emoxypine, and until recently I was taking 250mg 3x daily (now down to 75mg 3x daily). I&#39;m in the process of trying to eliminate substances that aren&#39;t really necessary/helping me anymore, hence the reduction.</p>

<p>Emoxypine is technically classified as an antioxidant actoprotector (defined as a synthetic adaptogen, which bromantane is also commonly described as). It has a wide range of activity beyond those that affect anxiety, but I&#39;m not going to pretend to understand it&#39;s pharmacology.</p>

<p>Suffice to say it&#39;s somewhat unique and is not a typical anxiolytic. I&#39;d check out Cosmic Nootropic&#39;s instructions for Mexidol. These are typically translated directly from the Russian insert.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s not terribly popular on this subreddit (probably because there is some minor potential for dependence, though I find the likelihood of that remote), you may also find some relief from Picamilon. You&#39;d just want to stick to the indications, as with any medication.</p>

<p>I use it from time to time (both, but I&#39;m referring to picamilon specifically) and it&#39;s helpful for occasional anxiety. I rarely see any benefit from taking more than 50mg at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. The issue with Benzo Withdrawal is downregulated GABA receptors, rather than a lack of GABA. I think Picamilon is a way getting GABA to cross the blood brain barrier, whereas Mexidol upregulates GABA receptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s mostly accurate. I don&#39;t think picamilon is as harsh as a GABA agonist, like you said it&#39;s more of a vehicle for getting GABA to cross the BBB.</p>

<p>Mexidol/emoxypine sounds like it acts primarily as a positive allosteric modulator of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors, from the literature I&#39;ve found.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to throw the PDF up on Google Drive a little later, it&#39;s fairly interesting. Excerpt:</p>

<p>&quot;[N]ot having the direct affinity to benzodiazepine and GABA receptors, mexidol exercises the modifying action by intensifying their binding ability. </p>

<p>These data together with the results of the analyses of mexidol&#39;s anxiolytic action with the help of analyzers bring the idea that mexidol&#39;s anxiolytic mechanism is determined by its modulatory effect on the benzodiazepine chlorine-ionophore receptor complex.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would look into a low low dose naltrexone and eventually titration, low dosing the receptors with an antagonistic drug like naltrexone can cause a reverse effect through upregulation after a given time through the bodys need to reach homeostasis.</p>

<p>Things would not get instantly better, but in the long term, it could help. Maybe this paired with emoxypine and maybe mag l-threonate could have a great effect on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I am slightly concerned that Emoxypine/Mexidol will interfere with the healing of my GABA receptors or at least that, because &quot;mexidol<br/>
exercises the modifying action by intensifying [benzodiazepine and GABA receptors]&#39; binding ability&quot;, there may be some downregulation of those receptors in response to the Emoxypine/Mexidol which is the same mechanism of action for tolerance to benzos, resulting in withdrawal upon cessation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had thought of that too. In my experience, emoxypine is far too subtle a substance and the pharmacology isn&#39;t the best understood (to my knowledge).</p>

<p>Overall, I view it more as a potent antioxidant. I actually take clonazepam as well (panic) and I was a little surprised when I read this, as I didn&#39;t notice any difference.</p>

<p>Your caution is overall a good thing (and well founded), but I doubt emoxypine will be an issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glutamine and/or taurine supplementation may help in the long run. Dosages vary, but 500mg of both together is fairly calming.</p>

<p>Theanine will also be helpful, as would anything that helps modulate/calm glutamate excitability.</p>

<p>NAC or NACET would also likely be helpful during this time.</p>

<p>Magnesium L-threonate, vitamin C, omega-3&#39;s are also highly recommended for general health. If you&#39;re not taking a high quality multivitamin and/or B Complex, I&#39;d also recommend looking into that.</p>

<p>Selank would likely provide symptomatic relief. Any form would work, NA-Selank Amidate is usually the go-to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NACET is a far more effective form of NAC that boasts oral bioavailability upwards of 70-80% (NAC has an oral bioavailability around 4% for comparison). You&#39;d likely see far greater benefits and with less dosing required with NACET vs. NAC.</p>

<p>That said, it has the strongest smell of any noot I&#39;ve used, and it doesn&#39;t taste much better. Given the small amount required, the taste really isn&#39;t an issue for me. It&#39;s easily masked if you prefer.</p>

<p>As far as sources, for NACET both Everychem and LiftMode stock it.</p>

<p>For Selank in the UK, you may want to give PureRawz a try. I&#39;ve made a handful of purchases from them. They&#39;re relatively quick and most items are reasonably priced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Olds take it like candies here in Russia because it can be prescribed for cerebral bloodflow/cognitive impairment/strokes. I can get why it can serve as oxidative stress protector or reducer of ischaemic neuron death (on paper!!! soviet/russian drugs are usually not properly evaluated to work or not by evidence based science) But I don&#39;t get why it would help with benzos more than lifestyle changes and things like agmatine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I had thought of mentioning Agmatine sulfate as a possibility as well. I&#39;m not sure of the precise mechanism involved (or agmatine&#39;s pharmacology in general), but anecdotally I&#39;ve heard it can be incredibly helpful for kratom and/or phenibut discontinuation, tolerance, and withdrawal.</p>

<p>May be worth investigating. Appears it may be worth a shot:</p>

<p>&quot;Agmatine’s effectiveness for drug addiction requires further research, but preliminary animal studies show promise in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. These studies showed a decrease in alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and anxiety after supplementation.&quot;</p>
