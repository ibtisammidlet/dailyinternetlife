        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">67</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2023-03-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../../user/sirsadalot.html">sirsadalot</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is in regards to the pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, as well as toxicology of Bromantane, which has been brought up again as of late.</p>

<h1>Pharmacokinetics</h1>

<p>I&#39;m going to start off and say that I give my apologies, as I have re-read the <a href="http://library.lol/main/CD8E44AA817FFB656E936429BF0A8496">Russian book on adamantanes</a>, and it would appear there has either been a mistranslation or typo by the Russian authors which wrongly made me believe its half life was increased when administered intravenously. Looking at the data table, it would appear the plasma half life is <em>reduced</em> when injected.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean that intranasal Bromantane isn&#39;t a superior route of administration. It has a wide volume of distribution, which results in less access to upper regions of the body, such as the brain due to lower organ accumulation (i.e. the liver and heart). In isolation, the half life of Bromantane in the brain is 7 hours. When Bromantane is taken orally, it is only detected in the plasma of subjects for about 4 hours. The metabolites of Bromantane, downstream of cytochrome P450, are anticholinergic, with a reduced stimulant profile. This could explain the widespread phenomenon of weaker effects when using oral Bromantane.</p>

<h1>Toxicology</h1>

<p>Recently a user has proposed that Bromantane may inhibit hERG, which has been identified as a toxic mechanism by a wide variety of drugs.</p>

<p>However this just isn&#39;t the case. They were basing it off of predictive analysis which, unlike some other AI, is still in the dark ages. As some others mentioned, various other prescription drugs are falsely flagged as hERG blockers, including long studied drugs such as Prozac, Propanolol and Clonazepam. </p>

<p><a href="https://cardiosomatics.orscience.ru/2221-7185/article/view/44966">Bromantane&#39;s effect in people with cardiovascular issues:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data obtained indicate a high level of safety, efficacy and good tolerability of Ladasten in the treatment of asthenia and asthenic spectrum disorders (somatogenic asthenia, nosogenes), the formation of which is associated with widespread cardiovascular pathology. Taking into account the high compliance of patients and the convenience of oral administration, we can recommend Ladasten for use in the treatment of asthenia in patients with cardiovascular diseases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10340117/">Bromantane&#39;s lethal dose:</a> </p>

<p>Bromantane&#39;s LD50 is 8100mg/kg in mice, which is a lot. That would make the lethal dose in humans something like 40 grams.</p>

<p>And finally, to dispel this rumor for good, Bromantane can act <em>oppositely</em> to an hERG blocker. Bromantane increases blood pumping to the left ventricle and heart beating (as shown by minute and stroke volume) which is opposite to hERG blockade. Bromantane is part of a class of drugs called antihypoxiants, and hypoxia inhibits hERG. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/">Source.</a></p>

<p>Bromantane has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/">numerous clinical studies</a> conducted in Russian patients, in which low (or no) side effects were consistent among all.  </p>

<h1>Mechanism of Action</h1>

<p>I want to make it clear that my theory on Bromantane being a kir2.1 potassium channel inhibitor is just that - <em>a theory</em>. But there are many things to support this theory.</p>

<p>Bromantane decreases the noise to signal ratio in preclinical studies, and can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10934588/">reduce work errors</a>, oppositely to the stimulant compound they used which acts as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. This goes back to the fact that indirect medium spiny neurons (iMSNs, D2 receptor containing) are inhibited in the presence of higher dopamine, resulting in less neuroplasticity and less calculated decisions. iMSNs are a class of GABAergic neurons which finely tune behavior and movement. This is why dyskinesia and psychosis develops in Parkinson&#39;s patients given L-Dopa, and why Amantadine prevents it. Amantadine both decreases ON time (dyskinesia) and OFF time (withdrawal) of levodopa, which is only possible by inhibiting Kir2.1, as it increases C-Fos in iMSN neurons which as a result resensitizes D2 receptors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition reduces inflammatory cytokines, and as a result, HDAC is indirectly inhibited, which gives rise to neurotrophic growth factors. This is seen with both Amantadine and Bromantane. This is believed to be the primary mechanism for both compounds when it comes to dopaminergic sensitivity.</p>

<p>The argument has been made that Kir2.1 potassium channel inhibition isn&#39;t responsible for the therapeutic effects of Amantadine, but I thoroughly disagree. Their reasoning was that ~29uM is too high to inhibit Kir2.1, as plasma concentrations are much lower, however brain tissue was found to contain <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8532138/">48.2-386 uM</a> in post-mortem subjects. Additionally, Kir2.1 can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8864065/">inhibited intracellularly</a>, and  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0042682281906140?via%3Dihub">a significant amount</a> of Amantadine concentrates in the cytosol, and not just in the lysosomes.</p>

<p>Thus the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/133398">original paper on Amantadine</a> stands, and I stick by my predictions on Bromantane.</p>

<h1>Does it upregulate dopamine?</h1>

<p>Yes, this much is proven. Enhanced locomotion (key marker for dopaminergic activity in studies) was displayed up to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11109517/">two months</a> after Bromantane cessation in preclinical studies, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21322821/">one month</a> in people.</p>

<p>I found a study in which Amantadine upregulated dopamine receptors, but I won&#39;t include it. The reasoning for this, besides the fact that some studies say the opposite, is people should stop focusing on receptor density when it comes to enhanced dopaminergic response. Increased or decreased receptor density is superficial, and increased dopamine receptor density can be found among most dopaminergics, including meth. To my knowledge only Bromantane, ALCAR and GDNF have been shown to produce lasting dopaminergic effects after discontinuation, with the former two also increasing GDNF downstream of HDAC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CDNF yes, but CNTF no because it isn&#39;t localized in the striatum. As well, CDNF has been shown to be synergistic with GDNF in its effects as talked about in this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28303260/">pubmed study</a>.   The findings of CDNF are still fairly new and being researched though there have been human trials of it with good results thus far. Here are a few articles that compound on each other with a quote from the first one to sum it up (Bottom link is about the human trials).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Motor activity was further evaluated by a treadmill test, which showed that CDNF-treated animals had less variability in stride length of the back limbs on both sides of the body two weeks after treatment. The treated animals also were found to have more even steps than controls.   </p>

<p>.....  </p>

<p>.....  </p>

<p>....  </p>

<p>An investigation of brain tissue found that while quinolinic acid induced a significant reduction in the number of neurons in the striatum, CDNF treatment restored these cells. At five weeks post-treatment, CDNF also led to a significant increase in the number of growing neurons in the striatum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment got much longer than I expected. For that I apologize, but bare with me. It&#39;s worth it for furthering the community&#39;s knowledge and progress that we all want.</p>

<p>While I can understand why you feel that&#39;s an issue, the potential concern is that there aren&#39;t really any adequate tests on healthy subjects since it&#39;s still fairly new in research. Parts of my comment below explain why healthy is subjective and isn&#39;t necessarily import when it comes to humans. The other issue being that while it has been shown to be detectable up to 72 hours after administration, they can&#39;t be conclusive about its excretion. CDNF doesn&#39;t have a know receptor, and while studies show that it internalizes into neurons, its done in a manner that isn&#39;t fully understood yet.\
So even when it can no longer be detected in endosomes or lysosomes, it still has long lasting effects with or without  current illness or induced bran damage happening as shown in the quote below.\
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5318544/#:%7E:text=Despite%20its%20relatively,to%20be%20studied">Quote from this article</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite its relatively short persistence in rat brain, in the rat model of PD a single injection of rhCDNF, given 4 weeks after 6-OHDA administration, had a remarkably enduring effect at the level of behavior, lasting for up to 8 weeks (Lindholm et al., 2007). This has been interpreted as CDNF having a neurorestorative activity similar to GDNF and Neurturin, for instance. Indeed, the long-term changes of neural function following a rather short exposure to rhCDNF imply that this exposure leads to more permanent changes through its influence on gene expression, perhaps similarly to the way neurotrophic factors like GDNF influence gene expression through signal transduction cascades. How CDNF triggers the long-lasting survival-promoting effects in the brain remains to be studied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And I in no way am meaning to discredit GDNF or make it out to be faulty compared to CDNF, but the below quote shows that while GDNF protects neurons, it has no restorative effect on dopamine neurons unless it&#39;s active while they are being damaged. So while GDNF is great for many things and always has a clear space for use, CDNF shows potential to be a better option when talking about the striatum.\
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0049-0#:%7E:text=In%20the%20group%20of%20animals%20where%20GDNF%20expression%20was%20on%20during%20degeneration%2C%20neurons%20were%20rescued%20and%20there%20was%20a%20reversal%20of%20motor%20deficits">Quote from this article</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the group of animals where GDNF expression was on during degeneration, neurons were rescued and there was a reversal of motor deficits. Turning GDNF expression on after the nigrostriatal system was lesioned did not rescue neurons or reverse motor deficits. In fact, these animals were indistinguishable from the control groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is you shouldn&#39;t push CDNF aside so quickly. Very much worth looking into and could be the next best thing for helping people recover from stims or unknown dopamine damage, and/or reduce the loss of dopamine neurons when taken with stims. <a href="https://www.medsci.org/v14p0340.pdf">This study</a> I read a while back showed that when taken with Methamphetamine, only an 11% loss was observed after cessation vs 47% in those given Meth alone.\
It&#39;s shown to be better at repair and protection in the striatum than GDNF as shown below. (From a PD multi study).\
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6628563/#:%7E:text=Similarly%2C%202%2Dweek%20chronic%20intrastriatal%20infusion%20of%20CDNF%20via%20implanted%20osmotic%20minipumps%20gradually%20normalized%20the%20motor%20behavior%20of%20the%206%2DOHDA%20lesioned%20rats%2C%20with%20prominent%20regeneration%20and%20sprouting%20of%20TH%2Dpositive%20fibers%20in%20the%20nigrostriatal%20pathway%20while%20GDNF%20in%20comparison%20had%20only%20modest%20effects">Quote from this study</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, 2-week chronic intrastriatal infusion of CDNF via implanted osmotic minipumps gradually normalized the motor behavior of the 6-OHDA lesioned rats, with prominent regeneration and sprouting of TH-positive fibers in the nigrostriatal pathway while GDNF in comparison had only modest effects. Notably, CDNF showed a significantly larger volume of diffusion in this study compared with GDNF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>In the end, most people that are interested in striatal dopamine neurogenesis are usually people that feel as though they have done some damage to it or want something to reduce potential damage/tolerance from things that increase it. Beyond that, wouldn&#39;t you say NTF&#39;s like GDNF and CDNF aren&#39;t things that you have to worry about having opposing side effects while using them? So sensibly you could taken them daily, or weekly, to help with dopamine as opposed to needing them to work for extended periods of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My estimate is an open shot since I don&#39;t know anything about your neurochemistry, but it may be due to acetylcholine levels being reduced too much. Lower doses of Bromantane have been shown to be anticholinergic (but not at higher &quot;clinically relevant&quot; doses). Low acetylcholine is linked to dry throat which can cause it to become sore. As well, low acetylcholine has been linked to reduced exercise endurance (as shown in myasthenia gravis patients among others). You can try eating a few eggs or taking ALCAR with your Bromantane to see if helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the individual you speak of (Pax) has been experiencing a psychotic episode. I feel bad for him, because it has persisted for over a week, and he&#39;ll be lucky to have anything when it ends. His sentences have been fractured and illogical, he hasn&#39;t been sleeping and he&#39;s been abusing THC. I had to block him because he kept spamming my inbox with violent, strange things. None of the people close enough to his family members have agreed to contact them about getting him, which is sad because he&#39;s a danger to himself and others in this state.</p>
