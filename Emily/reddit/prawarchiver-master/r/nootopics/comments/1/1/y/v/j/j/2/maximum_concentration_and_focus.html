    <div class="md"><p>Lower your expectations first. Then I would suggest lions mane from real mushrooms (cheapest good quality fruiting body extract with consistent results, nootropics depot has good extracts as well). It’s a good focus enhancer that’s great for ADHD-PI and just baseline mood, energy, and cognition enhancement that only gets better with continued use.</p>

<p>If that’s not enough try adding something like 4-dma-7,8-dhf from ND which has similar effects and likely similar effects on neuronal growth factors, mainly BDNF, that can offset some of the deficits seen in mood and cognitive disorders.</p>

<p>After that there are cognitive enhancers that may have the same properties but are less well studied and should be used responsibly. Semax is amazing for math and of these has good evidence, others are things like Tak-653, bromantane, and some of the racetams. But be fully prepared for the fact that there’s no “limitless” pill and these aren’t replacements for prescription meds or developing better habits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much. You put it into perspective for me. I&#39;ve seen Tak-653 talked about here alot and of course lions mane. I am reading up on fungi in general now. I know Reishi, Chaga, and oxytail have their own benefits too. Yeah, the title and the verbiage was a little over the top. But I think this is exactly what I was looking for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9-me-be is a highly underrated compound for ADHD (watch out for photo-sensitivity). It’s not magic, but it works to improve focus. There’s lot of talk about how good bromantane is, it gave me a spring in my step, but didn’t give me the absolute focus I was expecting. The point with many of the nootropics is ymmv. Plus, what worked for your once may no longer give you the same feeling. I would give almost anything to get back how I felt when I smoked weed - I felt superhuman for a couple of years and then it stopped working. Phenylpiracetam is the absolute undisputed king of nootropics for ADHD folks. I can no longer source it unfortunately- some of the stuff that’s sold as phenyl online is absolute garbage. Good luck finding it.</p>

<li>You need to be very careful about not building tolerance: do not use more than twice a week if you want to use it as a magic bullet. I hear you benefit from daily use, but I’d didn’t want to risk developing tolerance to it like I did with weed (I read somewhere that THC has different effects on ADHD folks comped to neurotypicals). </li>
<li>Perhaps you are new to the nootropics scene, I remember a time when phenylpiracetam was available from multiple reputable North American vendors (science.bio, Nootropics Depot etc.), but now I can’t find reliable sources. You can still source it, but the product seems dirty to me.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, new to alot Nootropics in general but I remember back in 2000 when I was thinking of &quot;magic bullets&quot; and bought what was called a &quot;prosper study system&quot;...just a bunch of white noise really, but I didn&#39;t know of any compounds. I used to drink a lot, I mean every freaking day (beers only), but I quit cold turkey about 2 years ago (I have no cravings now, nor do I miss it, I really wasted alot of time/money on that crap).  A few years ago , my sister started telling me to take Maca,  Ashagwandwa, and other concoctions of herbs and saw their direct impact on my mood (used to be a pissant to be honest) and energy levels. 2 years ago (around the same time I quit drinking), someone introduced me to entheogens and adaptogens (some of which I had been taking unknowingly). My background is in engineering, now I am interested in Mycology and its promise in environmental remediation, soil fertility, medicinal, biotech etc... I somehow managed to finish college with a f&#39;d up brain (not the best GPA of course). Never took any Nootropics other than caffeine  and a shit tonne of tea; veggies here and there; and fruits, and exercised in spades (cardio mostly, hated lifting weights). I had no idea there was all this other world. Funny that I&#39;ve been on underground IRC chats and a myriad of off-mainstreet topics but never once had I come across a full on Nootropics group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried the agmatine paired with pregnenolone (my hormones were out of wack). Like the other poster said, Agmatine seems to enhance the effects of whatever else you are taking. I&#39;ve been getting that steady focus I needed all day. Tak-653, J-147, and tropisetron when I really need to study heavy shit (I take them every other day for the week I need them...effects seem to linger a day or two after). I really go for low doses, and I get steady results.  The Panax Ginseng and Gingko work for a period but do not last that long for me. I&#39;ve heard continued/repeated use brings about the effects needed.  As the other poster said...exercise exercise exercise e. Meditation can be hard to start and keep up with but I&#39;ve heard awesome results. Shrooms (golden teacher, if not illegal in your jurisdiction) can get you back to &quot;being in the moment&quot; that Sam Harris keeps talking about lol! At least they did for me, but meditation is on my list.</p>
