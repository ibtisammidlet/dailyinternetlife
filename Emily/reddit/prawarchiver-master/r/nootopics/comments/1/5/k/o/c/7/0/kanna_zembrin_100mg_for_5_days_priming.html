        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I‘ve been taking 100mg of Doctor‘s Best Calm-Z Zembrin sublingually now for 4 days in a row, trying to prime myself, mainly trying to feel something and treating my depression and social anxiety. But nothing so far. Short time after 20-30 minutes of sublingual intake and then swallowing I feel a short feeling of relief of my symptoms and mood enhancement. But it‘s rather subtle, probably placebo, and away again very soon.</p>

<p>Anyone else who has been experimenting with Zembrin or having similar experiences?</p>

<p>Is 100mg for 4 days (5 days if I should continue tmrw) of Zembrin per day too much? I usually take 50-75mg at once sublingually and then another 25mg-50mg sublingually later.</p>

<p>Shouldn‘t I feel something?
Any tips? Am I doing sth wrong?
Maybe Zembrin is bulls***? Should I try another extract?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you trying to treat depression directly? I think most Kanna Extracts are more potent intranasally. I did see a method also where someone put the powder into a piece of toilet paper and and turned it into a a snuff pouch for under theyre lip and said it hit hard. A good Kanna Extract when it hits should be very noticeable. Its got a bit of an MDMA vibe thought nowhere near that level of intensity. Overall I don&#39;t think zembrin or related products is a valid way to treat depression long term. I&#39;d try the Agmatine, NSI 189 and Tak 653 personally. Much better results. </p>

<p>As a rule, I try not to fuck with serotonin or Gaba too much. THere is always a price to pay eventually when you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I will try out the toilet paper snus like pouch thing. I also heard of doing pouches/kanna snus by oneself by buying empty pouches and filling in the Kanna. </p>

<p>I definitely seemed to have the same thoughts about intranasal being stronger and more potent but I‘m not sure if Zembrin can be taken intranasally and mostly I just dislike the thought of insufflating something via nose… But if stronger extracts won‘t work neither I will surely have to try the intranasal ROA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recommended on the bottle is one capsules of 25mg. I do take 2-4 now as before one or two didn‘t work neither, first orally, then sublingually. Now after a few days break I started doing 2-4 of 25mg sublingually and still nothing, so in total my priming I‘m doing is for a longer time than only these 4 days by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might just not be for you. 25-50mg works well for me, even as-needed. It&#39;s not a huge difference, but a mild mood boost and a dose of calm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zembrin, orally. Have tried other Kanna and it&#39;s way too strong. Makes sense for recreational use, but I&#39;m looking to treat depression.</p>

<p>Honestly might just be going back on SSRIs though.</p>

<p>25-50mg of Zembrin is definitely noticeable and helpful for me personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re set on using Kanna, get mt55 extract and insufflate. The first time I tried it, I took only 40mg intranasally, and a few minutes later an intense wave of nausea and a buzzing feeling hit me and I had to lay down. This unpleasant feeling lasted about 15 minutes, then faded away and I was left with an extreme concentration, and good mood for  more than a few hours. Next time I cut the dose in half and had an equally intense wave, but the positives after were slightly decreased</p>
