<p>They were having a glitch in the payment system and they eventually refunded my money. </p>

<p>I’ve since placed an order which went through without issues.</p>

<p>Thought I would post this update since I had raised some questions about the company in the last post.</p>

<p>Based on the responses I got the company seems very reputable though sometimes customer service can be slow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a bad experience with their Tropisetron HCL; it gave me severe depression. And their TAK-653 has Propolyene Glycol (which isn’t listed on their website) which I’m very allergic to. Both droppers were not sealed with anything &amp; opened way to easily. I’ve sent 3 emails and no reply. I would love to try their Carnosic Acid, but since a full ingredient list isn’t on their website and they have non-existent customer service, I can’t rationalize supporting a company that doesn’t care to even reply. Especially one that’s suppose to be about helping people help their well being. I’ve been emailing since mid-July.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what&#39;s good for getting off benzos depends on what you&#39;re trying to do, tropisetron and carnosic acid are anxiolytic (and the latter also sedative) in different ways than benzos, cortexin helps with benzo withdrawal and tapering and is gabaergic. bromantane reduces social anxiety. pinealon and neboglamine might be helpful too but i know less about them.</p>

<p>sodium valproate should never be used except as a last resort for mood stabilization and seizures. it&#39;s specifically known for its terrible side effect profile. beta blockers are also not great (edit: for this purpose, and IIRC they do have some kind of minor physiological withdrawal effect). the everychem way is to use drugs which have no tolerance, no potential for dependence and withdrawal, and no (or few and minimal) adverse effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clonidin and beta blockers are frequently used in rehab clonics, they are great at migitiating the rebound benzo effects.
Valproat is also a really intresting compound. I will post some literature tommorrow.
As far as i know it can cause liver damage (which you can manage) and can cause severe birth defects if you are pregnant (not important if you are a male). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not OP but re: seizures, valproate is actually okay as a first option. It&#39;s cheap, and it works on virtually all kinds of seizures while not exacerbating any specific one. Plus, valproate doesn&#39;t negatively impact mood unlike most other antiseizure meds (which typically worsen depression).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that it reopens the critical period, but it&#39;s just one study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an anxiety disorder and often suffer from tremors which Valpraot helps a lot with. Much better than the SSRÍs which iI&#39;m also on. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it raises BDNF and other growth factors in the brain and is also a aromatase inhibitor and actually increases the production of androgens in the body (I don&#39;t know how significant these effects are).</p>

<p>The main reason doctors are afraid of it is the possibility of severe liver damage, but quite rare and in most cases only transient. You can still counter this damage by taking TUDCA and NAC. But still, get your liver values checked regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have ordered 3 bottles of Bromantane from them and was very pleased (was across two orders - 1 bottle in the first, 2 in the second). Shipped and arrived quickly, especially the second order. Definitely legit and it helped resolve some issues I was having with suppressed Dopamine production from long-term use of 5-HTP.</p>

<p>Note that the sprayer on the first did stop working before I finished the bottle, but not a big issue. As sprayers go they are good quality, shit just happens sometimes. I emptied the bottle into a different nasal sprayer and was good to go. No issues at all with the sprayer on the second two!</p>

<p>They also included a nice factsheet with the orders that give deets on how the compound works, dosing per spray, and the makeup of the solution it was suspended in. Thought that was a nice touch.</p>
