<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been struggling with porn addiction for a while and I&#39;m currently recovering, I&#39;m making good strides but I&#39;m looking to optimize my recovery with nootropics &amp; compounds if possible so that it&#39;s smoother, faster... I got real side effects, I have ED that gets better with time, brainfog, struggle with concentration...</p>

<p>From my understanding many things are at play, habits &amp; neural pathways I&#39;ve built, dopamine downregulation, pre-frontal cortex atrophy...</p>

<p>As such I&#39;m thinking that upregulating dopamine and increasing BDNF for neuroplasticity &amp; new habits building could be good mechanisms of action.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Obviously does not substitute with proper therapy, meditation, exercise, sleep, diet... But I&#39;ve been wondering if cerebrolysin, NSI-189, 9-me-BC, Semax could all help for different reasons, Bromantane &amp; Noopept as-well, what would be your advice on the things that may yield the most results ?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already ordered Uridine, Alcar, Alpha gpc amongst other things that may upregulate dopamine, I also ordered NAC as it may help with fighting cravings and leveling myself out.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I strongly consider purchasing semax for the potential pre frontal cortex and bdnf benefits, NSI-189 is also intriguing to me. Cerebrolysin looks like a fantastic compound altho expensive, which is why I would look into it in a last resort kind of way.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Any advices on how I could improve my recovery is appreciated, thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend 15-25mg 9-Me-BC for 20+ days. You will probably need few cycles to fully heal though. It will regenerate your dopamine system and upregulate d2 receptors. You can take it together with other dopamine healers like forskolin and ALCAR. Lions Mane helps with cravings and is good for neuron regeneration so I&#39;d consider taking that as well.</p>

<p>If you want to go hardcore you can combine with dopamine antagonists like quetiapine, which will upregulate your receptors even faster. It&#39;s very effective, but you will sleep whole day. (which actually can be good, since you wont engage in any dopaminergic activities that way). It starts to antagonize dopamine receptors at ~200mg but I suggest at least 300mg+, twice a day.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s said that it usually take around a year to heal. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if you could heal in 3 month using the above methods though. I&#39;m using the same methods currently with great success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate your response, this is very interesting. So you would say your experience with 9-Me-BC has been very positive in helping you recover ?</p>

<p>I just read about quetiapine and it seems rather extreme, I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re knowledgeable in that regard but would something like sulbutiamine be a better alternative ? It seems like it upregulates the dopamine receptors while not having as many negative effects has seroquel/quetiapine.</p>

<p>I will read about forskolin, I already ordered ALCAR, Uridine &amp; cordyceps as they all may upregulate dopamine.</p>

<p>Lions mane is interesting but I&#39;m not sure I wanna mess with it as it seems like it is a 5AR inhibitor, would the mechanism of action for neuron regeneration be different than potentially semax/cerebrolysin ?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I appreciate very much your support brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pleasure!<br/>
Oh yes, 9-Me-BC has been incredibly helpful in my recovery from the damage made from a decade of stims and other addictions. It&#39;s the most powerful dopamine restoration compound there is, most probably. I wish I would&#39;ve found it earlier.</p>

<p>Quetiapine is a bit extreme so definitely not for everyone. Regarding sulbutiamine, I don&#39;t think it would hurt to add, if you have money to spend, it&#39;s to my knowledge pretty innocuous. But is it effective at restoring? Idk.  </p>

<p>Like, I&#39;ve been taking ALCAR, uridine, citicolin, cordyceps and forskolin for months. I&#39;m sure they help with the recovery process, so I think it&#39;s a good idea to take them, but I can&#39;t really say I&#39;ve felt any noticable difference from them. It was only when I added 9-Me-BC/quetiapine I started to really feel better.  </p>

<p>You most definitely can replace quetiapine with regular dopamine detox-days though. I&#39;m sure that will help a lot. I personally cannot do it. Using stuff like quetiapine is dopamine detoxing on steroids.</p>

<p>The reason I suggested Lions mane is mainly because it removes sexual interest, so it&#39;ll help you not watch porn etc. Cerebrolysin will definitely help speed up the recovery by promoting neuron growth, neuroplasticity etc.   </p>

<p>To sum up what I believe to be the most important &quot;healers&quot;:<br/>
1. 9-Me-BC<br/>
2. Dopamine detox (which can be supercharged with antagonists like quetiapine)<br/>
3. Daily exercise</p>

<p>Everything else I think only should be seen as accessory, but you definitely want to make sure you&#39;re keeping the brain neuroplastic!  </p>

<p>Good luck with your recovery bro!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome, thank you very much for the report, could you let me know where you source 9-Me-BC &amp; how you were consuming it ? Was it powder or solution and was it sublingual ? I&#39;ve heard sublingual is the most bioavailable way of consuming it but it seems to be caustic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I bought mine from <a href="https://eurosupps.nl">eurosupps.nl</a>. 25mg capsules of their own brand. I open the capsules up and pour the content under my tongue. Tried oral dosing but it did not give me any noticable effect (it&#39;s a weak MAOI, so you will &quot;feel&quot; it. It&#39;s quite pleasant).</p>

<p>Yea, it&#39;s a bit caustic, nothing crazy thoug. It tingles in your mouth a bit the first couple times, and it&#39;ll reduce your taste slightly while you&#39;re on it. It has not bothered me really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome mate, one last thing since you seem experienced with the compound, do you have issues with photosensitivity &amp; sunlight exposure ? I&#39;m guessing if you&#39;re taking Quetiapine it may not be a factor if you&#39;re sleeping all day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the side, Easy Peasy Method, as it’s the best way to learn how to become free from addiction, by margin.</p>

<p>All things ppl said are good.
BPC-157 might be the only extra. Might spin some magic tricks on CREB/cFOS. You can do more research on that in particular, I barely recall something similar.</p>

<p>I tend to believe that we’ve got an issue there with CREB/cFOS more than D2 receptors. Working on D2 receptors would ‘level you up’ giving u a feel of normality, while that’s in CREB/cFOS that there’s the core issue.</p>

<p>Super anecdotally: people feeling normal for a few days after relapsing. Because of dopamine surge from stimulation? Not that much half life. Why they feel normal, if they’re desensitivized? They’d just need to feel ‘bad’ anyways.
So it’s more about molecular switches of CREB/cFOS, influenced by deltaFosb accumulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks. I will look into the mechanisms &amp; neurotransmitters you mentioned, I&#39;m still very new to all this.</p>

<p>Basically D2 upregulation would be interesting in the case of severe flatline causing low mood, anhedonia, low focus... Right ? As far as recovery goes, getting over the addictive tendencies and such, you&#39;re saying some other pathways may be better to target, is that correct ?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that NMDA antagonist may also help, glutamate receptors seem to also have their importance but then again I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>What do you think about increasing BDNF to promote neuroplasticity and the learning of new habits to replace the addictive behaviors ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Flat line”, “cravings”, and so on. Psyops. U’re not going to make it if u frame things like that.</p>

<p>Easy Peasy Method. Then bother about pills &amp; supplements.</p>

<p>Better dopamine status leads to less likely abuse.
Modafinil an example, studies on cocaine and meth addicts.</p>

<p>NMDA antagonism should increase D2 receptors density.</p>

<p>BDNF I wouldn’t care about it.</p>
