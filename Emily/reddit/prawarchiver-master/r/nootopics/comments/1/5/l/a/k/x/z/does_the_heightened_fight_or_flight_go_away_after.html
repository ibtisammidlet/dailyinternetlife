        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So far I like nsi as I usually am emotionally dead it brings some feeling and emotion to the table not over the top but noticeable. I also like that for me it almost eliminates social anxiety usually it’s not in me to start conversation with others however on this I am asking questions and continuing conversation and actually being the one to start it and overall being more in touch. The only time I really experience anxiety on it is taking caffeine too close to dosing. However when a fight or flight situation happens it is 10x the usual response to the point where I cannot think from the body load in the moment and end up just defusing as quickly as possible out of fear of emotional outbreak which leads to beating yourself up later on because the right words and actions could not come out at the time to better handle the situation and stick up for yourself. </p>

<p>I have also just learned the most significant increase of volume from nsi is in the right amygdala which sounds the least beneficial. “The right hemisphere of the amygdala is associated with negative emotion. It plays a role in the expression of fear and in the processing of fear-inducing stimuli.” </p>

<p>Is there a way to counteract this while still gaining the other benefits and will it go back to normal afterwards? if so how soon? I was honestly in it for hippocampus growth for possible emotional trauma but it seems it does not really “grow” it the way that everyone makes it seem. It increases in volume but not nearly as much as the right hemisphere amygdala. </p>

<p>Another thing I do not like about it is the noticeable increase in adhd symptoms. Having a hard time focusing my thoughts and easily getting lost in my phone as well as poor short term memory. Zoning out while trying to learn or focus on something. Learning in general now seems like a chore and I would rather listen to and watch entertainment like podcasts and such on YouTube which is not what I prefer but I guess that is the heightened emotional side to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was about to buy some but this would be my exact situation w/ cptsd</p>

<p>From what ive read when the amygdala or hippocampus grows its at the expense of the other, the other actually shrinks.  </p>

<p>Did you figure out a way to make the NSI189 work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The heightened fight or flight responses did go away eventually and I’m sure you would be fine if you do not get into any situations that trigger it. it kept happening to me because of what my environment was at the time. Other than that I felt it was good and helped with other things. I don’t think I would risk it with ptsd though, did you look into neboglamine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea im hypersensitive with people, luckily i live alone and rural now.  Its become unbearable, just a huge misanthrope now.  Have issues with intrusive rumination about past negativity from other people, really gets old.<br/>
 I need to try nebo again, i was in a bad living situation last time, crazy roommate.</p>

<p>Probably need to stop self medicating and go to a therapist at this point, really only a few things left to try anyway like cerebrolysin, nsi189</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate to that for sure. It’s worth a shot then I guess to run a cycle of it but don’t expect too much out of it for me it made things a little more vivid socially and I was actually initiating conversation when I am always quiet but also kind of switched my brain from not wanting to learn things and consume entertainment instead which also went away over time. I guess due to the heightened emotional aspect of it. I am pretty emotionally flat though and it did not make me not have control over my emotions in situations like other people report, only the fight or flight really affected me. I also had a slightly better time pairing it with lions mane.</p>

<p>Have you had any luck with any racetams? Honestly psilocybin microdosing would be the best option but it’s not as easy as ordering it online like all of this stuff is.</p>
