        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Long story short -- following the long, amazing post about dopamine, I decided to give both Bromantane and ALCAR a try.</p>

<p>Bromantane I tried the spray from everychem yesterday for the first time and I definitely felt a noticeable effect.</p>

<p>I got ALCAR 1000mg + Berberine HCL 500mg from a German brand on Amazon.de which looked okay-ish and had good reviews. I figured out why not, they should be pretty common substances, right?</p>

<p>I took both this morning, on empty stomach, first Berberine then ALCAR about half an hour later.</p>

<p>I think I felt no effect whatsoever. I don&#39;t have a sensitive stomach but I&#39;ve read of people being upset by them. Well, even though I didn&#39;t eat until a couple of hours later, I got no trouble with it, everything fine. Just no effects at all.</p>

<p>Today I also drank a little more coffee than usual (two cups instead of just one) and I feel like it didn&#39;t boost me much like it usually does.</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m wondering either one of the following:</p>

<p>*ALCAR + Berberine actually smoothed out my dopamine levels without making me feel stimulated from coffee</p>

<p>*I&#39;m somewhat &quot;recovering&quot; from yesterday&#39;s Bromantane, hence I feel slightly anhedonic today</p>

<p>*This ALCAR doesn&#39;t do jack sh!t to me and/or it&#39;s not good quality being from Amazon</p>

<p>What&#39;s your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be bad ALCAR. Could be that you have MTFHR issues that render it ineffective. Could be some other weird gene thing. Does it taste sour? Try taking a higher dose and do it consistently. I don&#39;t see any reason to combine it with berberine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s with the taste, should it tell if the substance is legit? It&#39;s capsules so I didn&#39;t taste anything, maybe I&#39;ll try opening one and seeing if it comes out as a powder or something.</p>

<p>MTFHR mutation I didn&#39;t know could be related to ALCAR. I have suspected it but never tested because I don&#39;t really know how, but I shall inform myself about it. i remember I was taking a good B complex (Jarrow) and it made me feel slightly different, maybe better, which is what led me to suspect a potential MTFHR issue.</p>

<p>Berberine I remember that sirsadalot recommended it to enhance dopamine absorption but I might be wrong or that info may be outdated...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If ALCAR made you depressed then it might be because you&#39;re very sensitive to choline, probably nothing to do with MTHFR. I&#39;m not an expert on MTFHR but most nootropics, especially anything dopaminergic like ALCAR, seem to be affected by it in some way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I casually returned to my old-ish thread and read your comment. I also suspect that ALCAR makes me depressed! I couldn&#39;t really be sure about it, but now that I have tried it on and off, like once a week or so, at different dosages, I can definitely say that the only noticeable effect is making me numb. I just get in a bad mood, anhedonic, no joy in anything. I noticed it because more than once I have tried it before going for a night out and every time it ended up having the opposite effect than the one I wished for.</p>

<p>Did you have any further insight about it, in the meantime? Is it for the MTFHR mutation, or perhaps choline sensitivity like the other commenter said?</p>

<p>Also, how does one suspect to have and then test for MTFHR mutation? And eventually, how do you treat that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Berberine is best taken with a meal, particularly a high carb meal, as it lowers blood sugar.  Blood sugar can be low upon waking up, and Berberine could make it worse.</p>

<p>This is all just theory, please correct me if I’m wrong .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried high quality alcar and bromantane, and the both don&#39;t work. 
They are telling you that you have gene mutation, don&#39;t listen to them. 
These substances don&#39;t work.</p>
