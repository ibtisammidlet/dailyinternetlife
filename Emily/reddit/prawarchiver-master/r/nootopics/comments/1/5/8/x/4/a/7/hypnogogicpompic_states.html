        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m fascinated by the state between dreams and sleep or dreams and awakening, where musical ideas appear that i only wish i could create in an awakened state. I read something on wiki that REM is characterized by high acetylcholine activity and low serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine. I know this is super wishful thinking and highly optimistic but have you guys found any substance/noot/drug, preferably non psychadelic, that gives you a similar state of mind to this hypnogogic/pompic state?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boosting acetylcholine before bed or when someone wakes up like halfway thru the night is a strategy some people use to increase likelihood of lucid dreaming. The main thing I’ve seen people use is galantamine. I tried this a few times and it does work for increasing dream vividness. Other acetycholinesterase inhibitors might do the trick too like huperzine A. A few other things I’ve encountered boost dreams when taken at night time. Namely, MK-677 and bacopa monnieri. </p>

<p>Other than that, a few things I’ve taken have boosted dream states even when just taken daily in the morning. This list includes Lions mane, NSI-189, and 7,8-DHF.</p>

<p>A few of these things are somewhat high risk. Like I wouldn’t recommend taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors regularly, especially at night time due to a negative effect on sleep quality, just saying it is a strategy some lucid dreamers use. Also, MK-677 can potentially raise blood glucose levels concurrent with its effect at increasing growth hormone. This one does boost sleep quality though for many people. Also be careful if you use NSI-189, it can greatly heighten emotions, too much for some people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I happened to have had analysed quite a few hypnogogic/pompic states while I supplemented ALCAR during the day. I don&#39;t know if ALCAR increased it, but at least during the day it made me much more analytical (thinking visualizing and analysing patterns all in my head like some mad mathmatician)</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if ALCAR made me more analytical when I was in such states. Thus it made be able to transcribe it better and make it seem more meaningful (consiously and maybe subconsciously)</p>

<p>One tip I have for you with music, as I tried to use it for that as well, is to instead of trying to remember exactly what you heard (quite impossible for me), to try to abstract everything you hear while in such state, to simple things like numbers. Eg: I heard an arp, I noticed the pattern consisted of 4 notes and 4 chords. The notes went up up down 2 up and the chords were .... However you like</p>

<p>Yes I was able to implement the abstractions, yes they were quite genius although simple in retrospect. No I personally did not come close to exactly replicating the (entire) sound. I did not focus on that</p>
