I&#39;m taking bromantane which I like a lot but it doesn&#39;t work as well as it did at first, I&#39;ve been thinking about semax too, do you have any other ideas? I do a lot of sport, I eat a balanced diet, I sleep early, my lifestyle is good but these poisons put me to sleep too much, I can&#39;t wait to stop them! Have a good day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;m going to stop taking benzodiazepines, but unfortunately I can&#39;t stop them cold turkey. I&#39;m going to stop them gradually with the asthon protocol. It&#39;s going to take time but I&#39;m going to suffer less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it would be fighting the GABA increase of benzos. People probably use stimulants for this, but benzos+stimulants seems like a degen stack tbf. I think lethargy is a limitation of benzos&#39; mechanism of action and any nootropics will be limited in how much they can improve negatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have combined them before, most significant interaction is that they block each other out a bit. You will feel the benzos less and feel modafinil less </p>

<p>Anyways, why are you even taking benzos in the first place? I would quit taking them as soon as possible, they’re insanely harmful and addictive 
Hope it’s only for rare emergency usage otherwise you’re fucking up your brain bigtime. You can take all the nootropics in the world but benzos will counteract all nootropic benefits and make thinking + memory worse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I understand, I have also been a benzo addict once. Benzos aren’t bad necessarily if used sparingly for panic attacks but yea it’s weird to keep prescribing benzos long term. </p>

<p>Good luck with your taper, at least you’re not a really big dose. How long have you been on it? 
The withdrawals are probably not going to be massive or if you have been on them for a long time you shouldn’t have much or any drowsiness at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I abused RC benzos like etizolam when it was legal for 8 months or something and then hopped onto 50mg diazepam and tapered from there within 2 months. Was way too quickly and had massive panic attacks and heart palpitations for months after quitting. PAWs
But if 30mg prazepam is equivalent to 10mg diazepam then you shouldn’t have such big withdrawals as I had. You can do it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dont take modafinil long term. its just the next bullshit youll fall into. dont rely on such strong drugs. They all fuck you up. Rely on nutrients and good habits and maybe experimental drugs like 9-me-bc to repair some damage if there is some kind of drug for benzo brain repair. good luck quitting benzos, youll need it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, when I first take it, it gives me a burst of energy and happiness, I talk to everyone and I&#39;m happy. But after a certain point, it doesn&#39;t do much for me. And yet there&#39;s no tolerance with this nootropic, so I don&#39;t really understand.</p>

How long until you noticed the effects (Bromantane working)

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly no, I&#39;ve always eaten a balanced diet, with supplements like omega 3, vitamin b, c, d. The effects start to arrive after 30 minutes 1 hour I&#39;d say, it depends.</p>

<p>Unfortunately There&#39;s not much information if your body builds a tolerance to it. But like I said everyone&#39;s different,have you tried taking a few days off and going again?</p>
