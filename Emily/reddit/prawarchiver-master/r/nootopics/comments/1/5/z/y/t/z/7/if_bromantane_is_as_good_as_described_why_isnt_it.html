    <div class="md"><p>Not so surprising....
It&#39;s the same problem with a lot of Russian drugs: Bromantane, Phenylpiracetam, Semax, Selank, Noopept and so on.
All of them omare very interesting componds, they are prescription meds in Russia but:
1) I think that&#39;s hard for a non European or non American lab to get to those markets.
2) it&#39;s even worse with the recent events...</p>

<p>It depends of so many things:, and many depend on politics or depdn of the lab making it: as an example, Sulbutiamine can be bought like vitamins in France, it&#39;s a prescription med in many countries, or it&#39;s not available. (Sulbutiamine is not very potent, that&#39;s true)</p>

<p>On another hand, you can&#39;t (easily and fully legally) import Tongkat Ali anymore in Europe.</p>

<p>Another more serious case: Tianeptine is a prescription med in France (but laws are stricts on Tianeptine, for good reasons)...not approved in US...
On the contrary, Adderall is forbidden (or at least not approved) in Russia, for example.</p>

<p>Efficacy is not the main criteria...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for the whole Europe...it is, in France, and it&#39;s quite restricted: it can only be prescribed for narcolepsy. Since 2010, it&#39;s forbidden to prescribe it for jetlag, for night workers or for idiopathic hypersomnia other than real narcolepsy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should rephrase it. For example, in the UK it&#39;s a prescription, but not listed as a controlled substance like it is in the US. Also Canada. I get this prescription myself. When I first got it, I looked it up it said it&#39;s a Schedule IV controlled drug in the US, but in Europe - while it still requires a prescription - is not listed as a controlled substance. </p>

<p>There is restricting the use, like the EU did, but that&#39;s different than listing it as a controlled substance. </p>

<p>Perhaps this information is not entirely accurate then or perhaps you were confusing needing a prescription or restricted use with it being classified as a controlled substance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are right, I think I read your post a bit too fast, sorry.
Moda is not &quot;controlled&quot;, indeed.
That&#39;s quite logical, as Moda does not have a very high risk of abuse. No reason to take &quot;too much&quot; Moda willingly, you would only get a big headache.</p>

<p>Two examples of controlled substance in France would be Tianeptine or Zolpidem: it requires a &quot;secured prescription&quot; (not sure of the terms in English) paper from the doc, it is limited to 28 days, the drug must be bought quickly after prescription and no other med can be written on this paper.
All of this because of cases of abuse...
Quite a mess for me who take Tianeptine (with better results  and less negative effects than with SSRI like Escitalopram).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in the US there is something similar. They used to write controlled prescriptions on secured prescription paper. Now it&#39;s done electronically, but you have to show ID at the pharmacy, sign a waiver <em>every time</em> that you know it&#39;s a controlled substance and the risks, and it&#39;s limited to a 30 day supply with no refills. It&#39;s a nuisance to have to get a new one that often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty good question!
When you try to order on ND, there is a message saying that it cannot be sent to Europe anymore.
After a little check, it has been labelled as a &quot;novel food&quot; in Europe and not authorised...it&#39;s not forbidden to own, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s illegal for them to send it to Europe.
Tongkat is not a miracle at all but a month on Tongkat (if the extract is good) gives pretty good results bodywise. (but it&#39;s absolutely not a nootropic, let&#39;s be clear)</p>

<p>Some countries also seem to want to ban import of Agmatine Sulfate, which could be a big problem, as it&#39;s pretty good for depression.</p>

<p>Isn’t that more explainable with simply « current DRIs already work awesome according to tons of studies for what it does, so let s just study Bromantane for a few years before rushing its widespread commercialisation? »</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the fuck would anyone fund that study? Use your brain. Why can&#39;t certain things just be developed through happenstance? More stuff had to be going on in Russia cause they needed to catch up with the US, and this desperation led to innovation instead of simply copying us. It doesn&#39;t even necessarily have to do with communism. Jfc guys. The people that started certain things could have different motives, starting points based on the data of others, different access to materials. There&#39;s also the assumption that a lot of these things aren&#39;t at least used a bit by the US, but this simply isn&#39;t true either; things like cerebrolysin are prescribable in the US iirc, there&#39;s just a certain availability bias based on what doctors typically learn in university to not use these things. This isn&#39;t necessarily to do with efficacy, but with perceived efficacy. My personal issue with your efficacy argument above all else is that studies are controlled things where they specifically seek out a type of person in which it will work. Well, what if they get it wrong? What are the repercussive effects on such a person? They can be pretty bad, so I don&#39;t think these studies give a full picture of how things work in the real world. Now, bromantane on the other hand, would not produce these same effects if they get it wrong.</p>

<p>Because healthcare wasn’t a market, there was no profit incentive that conflicted with research, nor the problem of patents. They were then able to freely and widely distribute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I administered Bromantane in a lab experiment with l tyrosine supplement for a week. The effects were profound, increased appetite, increased quality of sleep, unbelievable strength gains, increased dopamine production-felt like I was on another level up in life(sense of well being, very energetic but relaxed), 100 percent self confident -not over/ no ego. Downside, I was slightly agitated at times when “coming down”. Stopped my research after a week due to finding out how Bromantane activates the APP Gene, which accounts for some of its beneficial properties. The brain’s inability to remove APP segments while sleeping promotes plaque formation. This plaque formation has been linked to Alzheimer’s in more recent studies. I have a conspiracy that the medical company producing Bromantane (not saying this is true) discontinued the product under the guise of underutilization (as quoted on the cosmicnootropic page) when in actuality they made the APP/Alzheimer’s correlation as well - they don’t want to mess up their public image which is understandable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard that there is no risk of Alzheimer&#39;s unless one takes very high doses of Bromantane, which is what sirsadalot always claims. Are you saying that&#39;s not true and that there is actually an Alzheimer&#39;s risk with Bromantane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no information indicating this claim, at least to my knowledge. Sirsadalot sounds like a knowledgeable individual and he provides a decent service with my limited experience. As far as my mental health is concerned I think a healthy dose of skepticism, research and care is essential, especially when it comes to newer/discontinued medications. So you will excuse me for being forward but sirsadalot is running a business so motive is evident. Also, look at his products, for example, his BPC-157 is NOT sealed for biological safety, this should be a clear indicator for his business practices. For all we know (with all due respect) it could be a foreign based lab (I’m in US) that is posing as an individual and has other  questionable lab practices. The only reason I am stating all this is because I genuinely loved the product at first, then found it potentially threatening and hope to provide a sincere cautionary tale to others because I genuinely don’t like to see other people mess their lives up. You’ll have to excuse my passion as I really thought Bromantane was the “solution”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first couple days on it were amazing for me. Significantly increased motivation, verbal fluency, confidence, libido and anxiolysis. Also seems to help with strength and endurance in the gym. It also gets very relaxing and sleepy if you don&#39;t get up and do stuff.</p>

<p>After using daily for a couple weeks I came to the conclusion that it was sometimes giving me brain fog, making me more irritable, and hurting my recollection of recent events.</p>

<p>The effects on recollection suggest it impairs episodic encoding, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s an NMDAr antagonist (like amantadine, memantine, <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/md/c4md00244j/unauth">and other adamantane amine derivatives</a>), or possibly a VGCC blocker (like many of the derivatives in the above paper.</p>

<p>That&#39;s complete speculation though, as there&#39;s very little evidence on what it does or how it works. There&#39;s been some Reddit posts claiming to explain how it works, but most of these are taking very limited data out of context or just speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, well ok.  just an idea, if you want to induce ADD/ADHD to yourself, practice doom scrolling or watching tiktoks/yt shorts where you train your mind to pay attention only for 2-15 seconds. do this daily every single day and see what happens. you can see this when you talk to young generations that practice this, their mind loses the subject and change topics every 20 seconds~ without being able to sustain a longer conversation on topic. on the opposite example, practice meditation specifically one-pointedness type of meditations where you teach your brain to sustain attention to something, this is the opposite of ADD and a good practice to get out of it. some people may have more serious ADHD symptoms than just induced forms, in which case they should really avoid doom scrolling and tiktoks/shorts as much as possible. also sleepig early and not eating processed foods (no binging on them as they stack in brain inflammation).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I induced adhd &#39;forms&#39; don&#39;t excist, because per definition it is a disease you are born with, not something you can get later on. What you describe as &#39;induced adhd forms&#39; are just logically called concentration problems. Note: a concentration problem, not a disorder. In these cases it is a symptom of something like eg the doom scrolling. Doom scrolling can make the main symptom of the adhd disorder, which is concentration problems, worse. Fixing it doesn&#39;t resolve the adhd if a person had true ADHD, it will merely benefit them to some extent in which they still have significant concentration problems at hand to deal with apart from what what temporarily excedurated</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does not apply to true ADHD. Adhd is something you are born with. This means consistent concentration problems and possible hyperactivity from the get go, without apperent treatable underlying cause</p>

<p>A real diagnosis is always made by taking these things into consideration with at least some valid form of analysis/control.</p>

<p>A person with adhd might perform even worse when eg doom scrolling, but it was always an issue. Thereby, because it was always an issue, trying to fix negative behavioral patterns like doom scrolling is included but is never the entire treatment of adhd, because fixing that issue will still leave the person below baseline in terms of concentration.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have true ADHD, and you do eg doom scroll, you still can have temporary concentration problems which are not classifiable as adhd. Those problems are than addressed with a treatment specific to the (non-adhd) problem at hand</p>
