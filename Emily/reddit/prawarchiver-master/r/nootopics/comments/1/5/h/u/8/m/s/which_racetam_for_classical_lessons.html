        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have this unique mind that is kind of like an excel spreadsheet. Instead of being able to focus on one thing at a time, my brain is geared towards focusing on many things at once which I‚Äôve used to my advantage in my studies of quantum physics and understanding the nature of reality.</p>

<p>But I started taking classical lessons and as I am practicing only one part of my mind is focused on the guitar while other parts are focused on many other things at once which makes my learning seem slower than someone else who is laser focused.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be practicing and simultaneously thinking about buying school books, the golden ratio, the physical manifestation of pi, some cute chick I saw yesterday, wondering what my dad is up to, my 85 year old grandmother, a customer who pissed me off a week ago, ableton live, getting a space heater for the winter, tweaking my budget, exercising, cooking etc etc etc</p>

<p>I took phenylpiracetam for years and loved it but am having trouble finding the non hydrazide </p>

<p>What racetam would you people recommend to help me be able to focus on just my damn guitar?</p>

<p>Pramiracetam? Or perhaps some new racetam I haven‚Äôt heard of? Maybe not a racetam at all?</p>

<p>I would appreciate your help</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following. Musician here too. Years ago I have used Phenylpiracetam, and CDP- Choline Which did better than alpha GPC. 
Recent times doing session work for the labels, I‚Äôm learning on the spot and writing the parts over and better getting points on the record. 
I have used TAK-653 with Tropisetron, some days then added PRL-8-53 and a choline source for PRL (either 2 hard boiled eggs or CDP-Choline. And had fantastic results. 
Also have had a low dose of adderall or Armodafinil. With Tak-653 + Tropisetron. And difference was adderall felt like the reward button was stuck on. These are amazing days doing half a day in music and other half assembling guitar pickups, or doing tedious fret work. 
Just hide your phone‚Ä¶ this stack makes you want to zoom in on info. Put phone in a timer lock case. </p>

<p>Armo with tak and Tropisetron 2 eggs, was more clear and that particular day was very long so, I powered right through the writing part, and production, learned/wrote new, then laser focus working the DAW computer software, locked in and not underwhelmed. </p>

<p>Never stacked armo with tak, trop, prl853, choline. 
But from these experiences with low dose adderall. I see armo being less dopamine oriented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Original piracetam everyday with alpha gpc 
Pramiracetam will give laser focus not much mood boost. I didn‚Äôt care for it. Being a musician I would recommend piracetam everyday 4-7grams (split3x a day) and phenylpiracetam for more stressful days or learning days etc. always pair with alpha gpc it Synergizes, I think better than such a clean, even though they both essentially do the same thing as the choline source.
Edit spelling
Also days that require phenylpiracetam stack on top of piracetam that day. Also oxiracetam stacked with aniracetam and piracetam (‚Äúpao‚Äù stack if you look it up) might be right up your alley also dose of phenyl 125mg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for your input. I appreciate it. I‚Äôll look into to sourcing some cheap piracetam.</p>

<p>In the meantime I‚Äôm experimenting with a centrophenoxine and noopept stack that I kind of like.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve tried bothe oxi and ani years ago and I remember ‚Äútweaking out‚Äù on things so maybe that would be good for me right now. </p>

<p>My mind is still all over the place in my psychology class üôÉ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used those two together with aniracetam and adrafinil it was an amazing stack. The centrophenoxine was impressive as I never felt much from dmae</p>

<p>Edit I also love noopept 30mg oral I find two three times a day
Aniracetam I would also take two or three times a day with the noopept and the other I would take twice a day how are you taking it</p>
