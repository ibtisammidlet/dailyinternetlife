<p>UPDATE
So for the last few days, everything seems to be going well, he‚Äôs more calm definitely more organized with his thinking and he seems to be happier. Last night a few hours after he fell asleep, he woke up in excruciating pain crying couldn‚Äôt walk couldn‚Äôt put any weight on his right leg was cramping it was hurting and he‚Äôs five with autism and couldn‚Äôt explain it. It was rather alarming after finding out that‚Äôs a rare but not serious side effect. I decided to call the doctor today but anyone experience that.?</p>

<p>Edit is this drug similar to clonidine. Which my dr so  graciously give me for my ADHD. I just hold onto them for anxiety</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Works well for me. Removes the side effects of stimulants. When I went off it for some days recently, I was less organized, so it does seem to work. If your son is drowsy for a bit, hold out. It takes about two or three weeks for fatigue to die down on any given dose. If it persists beyond that, then maybe reconsider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will restrain from being one of those people that gets excited cause I found something that works. I am adhd and was prescribed guanfacine but after reading so many different experiences I choose not to take it. </p>

<p>So the fun part, I did a ton of research and found the following <a href="https://www.psychiatryredefined.org/low-dose-lithium/">https://www.psychiatryredefined.org/low-dose-lithium/</a>.</p>

<p>So I ordered some lithium Orotate and I am day 3, when I say I feel amazing I literally mean it. My behaviour has completely changed I have a ton of natural energy, 3pm sugar hit is gone and the most important aspect for me intrusive racing thoughts are gone. </p>

<p>I suggest you do your research I am not a doctor nor is this medical advise. Dr James greenblatt was the answer for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, definitely keep him off stimulants as long as you can. As a kid, they made me apathetic and disrupted my social development. Since he has autism, that would be even worse for him.</p>

<p>I recommend if you do implement stimulants, to make use them as-needed. Especially if you can pair stimulants with a kind of &#39;study time&#39; and build up good habits that way. Just a suggestion.</p>
