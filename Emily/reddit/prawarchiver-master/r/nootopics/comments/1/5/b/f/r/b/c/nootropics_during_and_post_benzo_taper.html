        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey folks,</p>

<p>Im currently slowly tapering a benzo and going ok thus far.
Im looking for advice on things that can support taper and afterwards .
A leading benzo taper clinic in UK recommends magnolia bark and lemon balm during taper to aid sleep . 
Whats peoples thoughts on this ?
Atm using some agmatine at night and NAC. </p>

<p>Also post taper . Anything people recommend to speed up healing of the brain once im off them . 
I was looking into emoxypine and cerebroylsum . </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this ? </p>

<p>thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I have not heard that myself before. I love following the guy who made this video. Because of him, I have lowered my kratom use. And Taurine, I don&#39;t know what it does exactly, but since using it, I have been way more calm and sleeping all throughout the night. I&#39;m not even getting up to piss like I usually do. And no offense to the other people, and anecdotes I respect their opinions. But this Lucas in the video link knows his shit down to a chemist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah ive orderd jt and its on its way. 
Just was really checking if ok to use during taper as the “ benzo police “ on some forums so you cant you supplements that affect gaba during taper and will make it worse . Seem to be getting differing opinions. 
In my uneducated view , i seems it could help , as when reducing the dose it could provide some extra gaba so to speak . I may be wrong tho .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so too, it&#39;s very important to be optimistic and to support each other! I too made the mistake of quitting quickly, but it didn&#39;t work for me. There are others who have succeeded to quit 8 mg of xanax cold turkey, good for them. but in my case it&#39;s better to follow the Ashton protocol and not take any risks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i dont wanna risk akathesia again and be off work for six months . Wanna remain functional at best albeit there will be discomfort.
One thing i wanna warn against is using gabapentinoids such as lyrica or gabapentin for withdrawl.
I was given lyrica after the snri cold turkey and the wirhdrawl was the stuff of nightmares . Some say its worse than benzo withdrawl .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was prescribed vyvanse for adhd but stopped one week ago as was gonna make this taper impossible .
Immediately started bromantane to help upregulate my dopamine from the vyvanse use . Defo helping i can feel and stopping brain fog . 
Yeah these pharma drugs are good at first , seem magic tbh . But long term they aint no solution and create tokerence and withdrawl leaves the brain in a worse position . Hence why ive been delving into nootropics these past few months .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what dose bromantane ? how do you find it . I sleep ryt away after it , think its cause im just off vyvanse haha . But through time should help dopamine .
What attracted me to it is no withdrawl and upregulation where my vyvanse down regulates and leaves brain worse off ! 
Im using 36mg nasally with 1000mg tyrosine before hand . What about you ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends, I have it in powder form but it doesn&#39;t do much for me. And the intranasal spray, I take 2 sprays, so 18 mg is more than enough for me. Apparently the biovability is much better with intranasal. When you take too much, it can actually make you want to sleep and everyone reacts differently too. But I find it an interesting nootropic. I&#39;ve heard of memantine, which soothes withdrawal symptoms, but I don&#39;t know where to find it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been throuh the absolute hell that is benzo withdrawl and if i could give myself one piece of advice it would be to stay the fuck away from anything and everthing. Clean eating and exercise are the only things you need. I made my withdrawl process so much harder and longer by trying to fix symptoms with nootropics/ supplements. Somethings may help in the short term but in the long term it will just delay the healing of your gaba receptors. Also stay away from cerebrolysin during benzo withdrawl. It helped me for a few months until one day all the benefits evaporated. I developed the worst neuropathy of my life, i become severely hypomanic for a few weeks and i lost a good chunk of my verbal/ reading ability for 6 months with it slowly returning over the next 2 years(but never 100%). I think i may be an extreme case and I was just very sensitive to kindling but its not worth the risk at all. imo you should throw out all ur nootropics until you have fully healed. Start developing good clean eating habits and an exercise routine that will get your cardiovascular system working.</p>

<p>good luck.</p>

However been reccomened that nac

    <div class="md"><p>I used Xanax to taper off my alcohol addiction and then became dependent on Xanax for quite a while. I’m not going to pretend I understand all the chemistry because Benzo&#39;s withdrawal is very complicated. I can only speak from my personal experience. I found NAC helped a little, but in the long run, it made things worse. I’m not the only person who’s experienced that either. I have no experience with agmatine so I can really speak on that, but from a quick search, I can see that it increases GABA so I would avoid it. In my experience taking any supplements that affect GABA just delays your brain&#39;s natural healing. You should head over to r/benzowithdrawal. That is probably a better place to ask questions than this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Just be careful. you might be fine taking it. There are a few people on r/benzorecovery  who say it helped them and they didn’t have a negative reaction. But for me, it made everything a million times worse. Everyone’s different I guess. If you do take it though, start at a low dose to see how you react before doing a full cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I have not heard that myself before. I love following the guy who made this video. Because of him, I have lowered my kratom use. And Taurine, I don&#39;t know what it does exactly, but since using it, I have been way more calm and sleeping all throughout the night. I&#39;m not even getting up to piss like I usually do.
