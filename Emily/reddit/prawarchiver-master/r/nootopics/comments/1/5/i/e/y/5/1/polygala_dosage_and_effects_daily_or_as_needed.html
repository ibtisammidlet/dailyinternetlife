<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching the use of Polygala in traditional Chinese medicine and I&#39;m curious about its dosage and effects. I hope someone here can share their knowledge or experiences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is Polygala taken daily as part of a long-term herbal therapy or is it possible to use it on an as-needed basis for specific purposes (in my case: depression/bad mood and social anxiety/social events)?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the potential effects or benefits of taking Polygala you experienced and at what dosages have you seen these effects manifest? </p></li>
<li><p>Does it do anything for depression/mood, drive/energy/motivation and/or social anxiety/sociability/talkativeness?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate any insights or personal anecdotes you can share on this topic. Thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you didn&#39;t get any response yet. These kinds of questions are better suited for e.g. r/nootropics r/NootropicsDepot r/Supplements r/herbalism as we are more oriented to scientific research / discussion, the complexity of matter is usually higher.   </p>

<p>But I think the lack of response comes mainly from the fact that it looks like you haven&#39;t taken much effort to find the answers to these questions. As is usual in any sub, please use the search function first and you will probably find 20 previous posts of people asking the same questions and their answers. But hey don&#39;t feel criticized, I understand the reason you didn&#39;t probably has something to do with the mood issues / anxiety you&#39;re describing.  </p>

<p>Hope you can get some relief! I would personally recommend bromantane, which is very popular in this sub as it increases mood, motivation while decreasing anxiety at the same time. Also many people with PTSD have found relief from it. No dependence or tolerance either and there&#39;s barely any side-effects reported as far as I&#39;m aware. I think it&#39;s one of the few substances that I&#39;ve seen to work well for such a large part of the people trying it, so it tends to be one of the first things I suggest.</p>
