Ive seen thousands of posts on reddit saying what to take, and when, in order to avoid a nasty comedown and re-balance the brain with nutriens / vits that taking this Rx depletes in order to aid in overall brain health and recovery - per below, let me know if im missing something</p>

<p>Agmatine sulphate - 250mg at night
Cistanche - 200mg in morning
NAC - 600mg at night
Taurine - 1000mg in morning
Methyl B-12 sublingual - 5000mcg in morning
COQ-10 in morning</p>

<p>I take a full comprehensive stack otherwise 3-4x a week but have mentioned the above as ive heard they are ideal to take specifically to mitigate harm caused by amphetamines. I also have Mexidol (emoxypine) on hand which ive tried but dont really feel anything aside from maybe having a more regenerative sleep that night and morning energy the next day. My life is very hectic so its hard to me to experiment with noots and do the trial and error way of seeing how things are working given how inconsistent my day to day is. I also dont take NAC daily as ive read reports of anhedonia and i swear sometimes it makes me feel weird. Any advice here is always appreciated. Thanks everyone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amphetamine is neurotoxic no matter what, and tolerance and dependence will build indefinitely with use, regardless of the frequency or dose.</p>

<p>I&#39;d add magneium L-threonate. Emoxypine can be replaced with carnosic acid. Cortexin might be helpful for general neuroprotection.</p>

<p>Counterintuitively, you might consider a small dose of modafinil (or another VMAT2 upregulator) alongside amphetamine to reduce neurotoxicity. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/6qy2qo/amphetamine_an_additional_mechanism_of/">Amphetamine inhibits VMAT2, which is extremely neurotoxic when combined with dopamine release</a>. Methylphenidate also upregulates VMAT2 but combining it with amphetamine is iffier than combining modafinil would be.</p>

<p>The best thing would be stopping amphetamine altogether, trying a stack like bromantane + tropisetron instead, or switching to modafinil analogue, even Focalin is more sustainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They <em>appear</em> to be not toxic, as far as we know. But we don&#39;t know for certain what the long term impacts of taking some of these compounds at the dosages available because the research hasn&#39;t been done.

And what you are getting is something that is almost trivially toxic <em>at the dosages described</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just bad logic. We know that Adderall is neurotoxic. It’s not a nootropic. You might as well be recommending nicotine or low dose meth. Being well studied does not equate to being non-toxic. </p>

<p>While research chemicals are less studied than Adderall, many have passed safety trials and have been used by people for years without reports of extreme side effects. To assume that Adderall is safer makes no logical sense.</p>

<p>Every single piece of evidence on exercise that we have suggests this is untrue. Exercise is neuroprotective. Cell death through overheating is a whole separate issue. Hitting your head is neurotoxic.</p>

<p>Amphetamine is safe in the sense that the adverse effects are well-documented and you can live a perfectly fine and healthy life while using it. It works great for millions of people. That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t neurotoxic and suboptimal. We can do better.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When using drugs like amphetamine, you take on some very well-known risks <em>in addition</em> to unknown unknowns. There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know about amphetamine. The short and medium term adverse effects are well-documented, nitty gritty data on long-term effects at the neuronal and brain structure level are extremely scarce.</p>

<p>The risk of everychem drugs are purely unknown unknowns. Some of what we suggest has actually already been used for decades, like bromantane and tropisetron. They are safe and are well-documented to be such. We only advocate research chemicals like TAK-653 when they are extremely clean (no off-target effects) and theoretically sound based on everything known about neuroscience so far. There are always unknown unknowns, but I think it&#39;s silly to reject these on the idea that they might e.g. suddenly cause cancer through an incredibly obscure downstream mechanism after 30 years of use, that is somehow unpredictable under current neuroscience and chemistry knowledge.</p>

<p>Edit: also, the safety of a drug is purely a function of what it physically does in the body. We <em>do</em> have a lot of knowledge about AMPA PAMs. TAK-653 is a research chemical. But AMPA PAMs are well-studied and we know a lot about them. If it&#39;s a clean AMPA PAM (and it is), then it isn&#39;t new in the sense that a drug with a truly novel mechanism is new and unstudied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost hesitate to reply here because it seems like there was a tendency to interpret my above comment, which was meant to prompt some thought about contextualizing relative risk instead of thinking of it as a boolean (amphetamine = neurotoxic = bad = must be ameliorated), in an ungenerous fashion. However, I figure that it is worthwhile to try to fully explain myself here now that I am at a keyboard instead of on my phone in case anyone finds it useful.</p>

<p>For the record though, here are the things that I neither said nor implied, here or elsewhere:</p>

<p>Amphetamine is completely safe</p>

<p>Long term amphetamine use at pharmacological doses has zero downsides</p>

<p>We know literally everything there is to know about amphetamines</p>

<p>Exercise is bad for your brain</p>

<p>With that being said:</p>

<p>Yes, obviously exercise is good for your brain, I would hope that would go without saying. It is in fact exactly my point that <em>despite</em> that fact exercise as a whole contains mechanisms that could potentially be bad if they existed in excess or weren&#39;t balanced out by good mechanisms. I don&#39;t know exactly where the research stands on the brain impacts specifically, but we know for the rest of the body (not just muscles, but e.g. immune system etc) the benefits are <em>heavily if not primarily</em> mediated through hormetic stress. Given that particularly high intensity exercise greatly increases systemic inflammation in the short term, it would greatly surprise me if part of its neuroprotective properties were not due to hormetic stress as well.</p>

<p>For almost any change that you induce to your biological system, including pharmacological, you can identify individual mechanisms that are probably good vs individual mechanisms that are probably bad, and you are left with getting above the mechanistic level to understand which wins out at what dosages over what time frames. To the extent that some things are purely good or bad for you, I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s probably easier to find things that are purely bad for you (e.g. lead) than the inverse.</p>

<p>In the case of amphetamines, we both know of mechanisms that are neurotoxic (don&#39;t need to get into those) and mechanisms that are neurogenerative (alpha2 agonism, CART peptides). We definitely know that at high dosages and onder other circumstances that its use is damaging in the long run. But we know that <em>at least for some people over some dosages and time extents</em> that it actually causes increases in brain connectivity and density. Therefore, just like the vast majority of pharmacologia, the risk/benefit analysis is highly dependent on dosage protocol and probably at least a dozen other things specific to the individual.</p>

<p>You state that amphetamine is not optimal and that we can do better. To that I agree, it would be highly unlikely that this one chemical that we discovered in the paleolithic (this is a metaphor, I just mean in the timeframe of modern pharmacology), is the one optimal drug for to increase focus/executive function, etc.</p>

<p>But the OP wasn&#39;t asking about that, the OP was asking about how to decrease neurotoxicity from a very moderate dosing regime of amphetamines. Strictly in terms of answering the question -- it is extremely important to understand how much effective neurotoxicity that is likely to be present at that dose. And, given the fact that some people take ~twice that amount at ~twice the frequency and can actually see <em>increases</em> in brain growth, it seems to me that the amount of neurotoxicity is likely to be not a large concern. Hell, some people are prescribes <em>4 times</em> that dose, and at the very least don&#39;t see anything like the sort of lasting brain damage that recreational users can get.</p>

<p>Again -- just to be clear -- I&#39;m not saying that taking 60mg of adderall a day is good for your brain, I&#39;m not recommending it, what I&#39;m trying to do is contextualize the extremely important piece of information that the OP gave us that should be taken into account when determining the answer to his question, which is that his dosage regime is known to be extremely moderate.</p>

<p>In terms of the risk aversion point: yes, we clearly don&#39;t know everything there is to know about amphetamines, but that is a non-sequitor as that is true about literally everything. We can only compare it to its actual existing alternatives, not to some theoretical compound that we have perfect knowledge about. And given that, we know just about as much about amphetamines as we know about any drug. As far as drugs go, it is pretty much as known as a quantity as we are going to get.</p>

<p>Something from my original comment that everyone seemed to ignore is that I very explicitly said that you may find more known quantities as more appealing vs more experimental compounds <em>based on your risk tolerance</em>. This is a well known effect in behavioral psychology and economics -- different people have different risk tolerances. I wasn&#39;t trying to make a point about the median person, but rather saying that there are certainly risk averse people out there who would clearly prefer dealing with the risks of taking amphetamine vs the potential unknown risks of less studied compounds to either ameliorate those risks or of alternative compounds to take instead of amphetamine. <em>I am not one of these people</em>, which I think would be clear given the fact that I am here, but the relative amount of knowledge we have about these various compounds is a very important and <em>rational</em> factor to consider alongside your personal risk tolerance, and it seems to me that that is a fact that is often ignored here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommended magnesium L-threonate because other magnesiums are rate-limited at crossing the BBB, L-threonate is the only one that isn&#39;t and you really want to maximize your brain magnesium if you&#39;re using amphetamine. As far as I&#39;m aware, agmatine is mostly used for its antidepressant effects, so I&#39;m curious what you&#39;re trying to get out of it by taking it with amphetamine. I know very little about NAC, sorry.</p>

<p>If you are taking it to make it easier to grind at work then you should really give the bromantane + tropisetron I mentioned a try as a substitute, bromantane for motivation and tropisetron gives you an intense hyperfocus. Of course you could also try taking both of those together <em>with</em> the amphetamine if you wanted, you&#39;d probably be able to lower your dose by a lot and get the same or better output. Neither of those have tolerance either so you can take them daily forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phrase &quot;neurotransmitters are failing&quot; typically refers to a situation where the normal functioning of neurotransmitters in the brain is disrupted or not functioning as intended. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells, and if they are not working properly, it can lead to various neurological or mental health issues. It&#39;s a simplified way of describing a complex issue within the brain&#39;s communication system.  </p>

<p>I also have brain Scans that shows the damage that was done from 21 years of long term high dose use and abuse.  Because of the damage I have what appears to be Alzheimer’s at 37.  I’m in the process of getting a memory evaluation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a good stack.</p>

<p>NMN has been shown to counteract Amphetamine neurotoxicity ( in rats) if you’re willing to chalk up a lot of money for it.</p>

<p>Also Grape Seed Extract, R-ALA, Magnesium (Threonate, Glycinate, Citrate,) Vitamin C (later in the day)</p>

<p>possibly Memantine and Dextromethorphan, but there’s risks with them so DYOR.</p>

<p>L-THP at night may help residual stimulation, bonus if you add Prazosin or Guanfacine with it, but again proceed with caution and DYOR</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try bpc 157 … excellent for repairing and refurbishing dopamine receptors after adderal. Also bromantane does this I believe. There are quite a few options, but the most important thing is self care- make sure to eat before you take the meds and drink water throughout. And 10-15 mgs of adderal is fine if you are taking care of yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1,000MG before bed is what I’d recommend that dose range seemed standard to me I’ve gone as high as 2G before bed but didn’t notice anything more then I did at 1G there’s additional benefits from it as well so there’s no harm in it unless you’re on a budget 
And for taurine I’d recommend 1-2 grams twice a day it helps with a lot and you can take loads of it without harm</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ubiquinal/Pqq/shajit - 200MG - Where is this from? Life Extension? Have you noticed the PQQ adding any significant benefit relative to the Ubiq/Shilajit?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are you using arginine instead of citrulline? Was that deliberate or did you just pick one over the other? </p></li>
<li><p>Where are you getting your sulbutiamine from?</p></li>
<li><p>What prompts you to use the uridine and/or polygala since they are only occasional use? They seemed better for daily use, especially since you&#39;re using all the other ingredients for the Mr. Happy Stack.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel a slight improvement in cardiovascular endurance I can’t say much in terms of energy because I’m taking stimulants lol. I have tried Ubiquinol and pqq before in high doses preworkout and it is a game changer for sure absolutely amazing difference with pqq then without. - it’s life extension </p>

<p>I chose L-arginine partially because it was from the VitaminShop near where I live and they didn’t have any pure L-citrulline and it seemed to me that arginine would be more beneficial for blood pressure and more immediate vasodilation I’m almost out of Arginine now when I am im going to try pure citrulline.
I was for a while using beetroot powder on top of this for a similar effect and it worked very good I also got a nice energy boost / feeling from regularly using beetroot.</p>

<p>I got my sulbutiamine from nootropics depot 
There’s plenty of vendors for it though if you want me to link you one </p>

<p>I was using sublingual Uridine/Polygala daily for several months to improve the effectiveness of my stimulants the reason why it’s occasional is I stopped using it daily because I was trying TAK and Nebo and other things and I didn’t want to over potentiate or have any interactions. it’s amazing to keep your stims working effectively but it’s a pain in the ass to put a bunch of stuff under your tongue everyday lol </p>

<p>There’s tons of other things I have and experimented with I just didn’t feel like adding it all to the list because I don’t regularly use it enough like piracetam works really well with this as well as Noopept right after your dose starts working</p>

<p>Everything on that list is essentially to be has healthy and as safe as one can be using stimulants as well as to keep the stimulants working effectively enough to not increase dosage</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much appreciated! I&#39;m a believer* in ND and wanted their sulbutiamine but they either are completely out or have discontinued. And many other vendors either stopped offering it or are somewhat shady IME. I think I&#39;ll look at Pure Nootropics as a source for now and see how they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I’ll add with sublingual Uridine/Polygala I was using a low dose of uridine to get the best effect keep the Uridine below 50MG otherwise you’ll loose effectiveness of your stimulant also to add to that I was using coluracetam with this also sublingual and it was a very powerful combo</p>
