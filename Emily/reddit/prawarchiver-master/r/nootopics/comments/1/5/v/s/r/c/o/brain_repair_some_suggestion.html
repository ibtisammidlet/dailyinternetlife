        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello.<br/>
I have TBI induced by drugs and dehydration (E2 level crash / high inflammation). (I did some errors, trying to recover from PFS.)  </p>

<p>In a few words : mostly lost of emotions / loss of IQ / blank mind.<br/>
I&#39;ve had confusion and memory loss but it improved a lot thanks the protocole I&#39;m doing (joshua&#39;s protocole) and this point is now ok : not recovered but enough.   </p>

<p>I plan to try Stem cell injection later, but during this time, is there a way to help the brain to recover ?</p>

<p>I have probably a loss of dopaminergic neurones and I guess dopaminergic receptors.  </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your suggestion. I am open-minded to every compounds, natural or not.   </p>

<p>Thanks for Cerebrolysin / Cortexin advice, it was indeed in my wishlist.But I have one question : lately I saw few people(on the subbreddit) got very bad reaction from IN. Isn&#39;t much safer to do IM ?</p>

<p>I thought Veilight was bullshit, isn&#39;t it ?  thanks for your message  </p>

<p>EDIT : Is there some compounds to create new dopaminergic neurones ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There absolutely is the risk of an auto-immune reaction for IN. Porcine proteins are very similar to our own—somehow IN use seems to raise risk of antibody development while IM doesn’t. If one develops antibodies to any of the proteins in Cerebrolysin, their nervous system will be at risk of being attacked as well. Over a decade ago workers at pork plants were sickened due to inhalation of pig brain—here’s the link : <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pork-brain/sickened-pork-workers-have-new-nerve-disorder-idUSN1636729020080416">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pork-brain/sickened-pork-workers-have-new-nerve-disorder-idUSN1636729020080416</a>
The only reasonable argument I’ve seen is that the proteins in Cerebrolysin are broken down to a size where they (now peptides) can’t elicit an antibody response. Not sure of the veracity of that claim, though.</p>

You just break off the top (wipe it down before &amp; after alcohol wipe), use the filter syringe to transfer it into a bottle (or not necessary?), then wipe out sterilized nasal spray bottle alcohol wipe (or not necessary?), pour in, then use (not diluted)?

<ol>
<li><p>Pour isopropyl alcohol into a nasal spray bottle. Close it and shake it to clean it. Spray it a few times to clean it thoroughly. Open and pour alcohol out.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour purified water into spray bottle. Close and shake. Spray it until all the alcohol is out. Do this a few times to clean out the alcohol.</p></li>
<li><p>Disinfect the cerebrolysin ampule in a paper towel with isopropyl alcohol. Snap it open in the paper towel.</p></li>
<li><p>My spray bottle opening is the same size as the ampule so I just stick the ampule in the opening. It&#39;s a perfect fit so I just shake it and the liquid goes into rhe bottle. If this didn&#39;t work then I&#39;d use a sterilized needle to transfer it.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It assume you are doing the basic things like getting enough sleep, eating well and getting enough omega three fatty acids snd exercising?</p>

<p>Reddit may be a way to get suggestions, but I would strongly recommend that you verify the safety and efficacy of any recommendations that by looking at the scientific research before you try them. </p>

<p>I’m not sure which specific tests were run to determine that you had a traumatic brain injury or neurological damage from drugs, but focusing on increasing BDNF support the survival of existing neurons and to encourage repair snd growth.</p>

<p>Lions mane and lithium are normal supplements that increase BDNF that are generally safe at usual doses.</p>

<p>I’ve read that the peptides Semax and Selank are effective to increase bdnf, and have been used in Russia to help with cognitive function and anxiety. I’ve found that the NA versions of both peptides exert a noticeable short-term effects on me, but there isn’t much published research on Russian peptides, so its hard to really know.</p>

<p>I have read that 7,8 DHF is more effective than endogenous BDNF and longer lasting, and it has also been studied as a way to help heal a TBI.  You can find 7,8 DHF on Amazon. </p>

<p>Btw, I think that researchers believe that stem cells might help because they influence the expression of BDNF. </p>

<p>Looking at BDNF sounds like a reasonable place to start - but I’m not a neurologist. </p>

<p>Good luck! FWIF, there are MDs who specialize in this type of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly my sleep is bad but I spend lot of time in bed even if I can&#39;t sleep enough. (I have sleeping issues because of finasteride pill I took for a while some years ago)<br/>
I eat very well (paleo diet, no alcohool, no processed food.), and I spend lot of time under sunlight.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t do any test which showed me all the damage in my brain but my brain was burning for 2 or 3 months because of dehydration and E2 level crash temporary.  (yes I know we can&#39;t feel anything in brain because there is no sensitivity receptors but the inflammation was huge  + light / noise sensitivity extremely high). And it made me very anhedonic. At first the confusion / brain fog / focus / memory were very bad. Now it improved but anhedonia is still horrible.  (I was already blunted because of Post Finasteride Symptom but not at the same degree.)  </p>

<p>and Indeed, I need to do my own research, In fact I asked this with already some knowledge (about cerebrolysin, cortexin, selank, semax, Mr Happy stack...) and I wanted to see if there was some things I could benefits.  </p>

<p>7,8 DHF I have no idea what it is for exemple and i&#39;ll read all the studies I can find, thank you :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>7,8 DHF is a naturally occurring flavone. I hadn’t heard of it either until I read about it on pubmed. There is a stronger (2.7x) version that lasts twice as long, but that version can cause sleep problems.  I just use the original.</p>

<p>I probably should have started by saying that, several years ago, I had some issues and it seemed obvious to me that my e2 was too my 2e. I thought I had a set of symptoms and I assumed, without getting bloodwork done, that the cause was high e2.  I tried to lower it, and ended up really crashing it.  On the positive side, once I had the bloodwork done, I could do the right things to fix it.</p>

<p>I’m just suggesting that your self-diagnosis about what was going on in your brain to cause the symptoms is really just a guess.  You might just try addressing each of the symptoms.  </p>

<p>In terms of the e2, make sure to get a complete hormone work up.  I feel better with a high level of test, and an above average e2, which isn’t unusual. E2, DHT, total test and free test are interconnected.  There are docs that focus on this, but I never found them to be helpful…</p>
