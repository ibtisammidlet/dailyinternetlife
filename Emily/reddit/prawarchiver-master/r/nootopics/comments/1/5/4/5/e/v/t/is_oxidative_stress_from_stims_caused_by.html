    <div class="md"><p>Well I have only used amphetamine once in my life but have used things like pseudoephedrine and ephedrine plus caffeine back in high school. I would take a 500mg vitamin c, and melatonin at night. Melatonin has been shown to decrease amphetamine induced neurotoxicity. If I was using actual amphetamine salts I would definitely have a more comprehensive protocol. </p>

<p>One supplement that I thought would be a great addition to amphetamines is huperzine a. It sure is a bit excitatory but it increases dopamine in the PFC while blocking the NMDA receptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partially depends on the stim. With Adderall in particular, it gets taken up into the cell by the reuptake transports of dopamine and norepinephrine into the receptacles that hold the stored neurotransmitters. Where it reverses the transports and kicks out the neuro transporters creating more in the synapse and therefore stimulation. But some of the neurotransmitters get pushed into the cytoplasm and get oxidized into ROS and cause oxidative stress. Some neurotransmitters end up in the space between cells but outside the synapse and the same happens. Extra in the synapse gets oxidized etc. There are other ways amp is neurotoxic, but those are a few that cause oxidative stress from dopamine and norepinephrine. Serotonin is affected to a weaker extent.   </p>

<p>Amphetamine also over excites the NMDA receptors causing an influx of calcium ions which cause damage and over excitement and too much glutamate released. Too much glutamate is toxic and causes damage.  </p>

<p>Methylphenidate doesn&#39;t get taken up by the reuptake transports like Amp but still causes similar toxicities.   </p>

<p>Other stims like Modafinil, a weaker stimulant, but is neuroprotective. It protects the NMDA receptor from over excitement and although affects dopamine and norepinephrine, it does it in a different way that I don&#39;t recall off hand. And not necessarily in the same areas of the brain as CNS stimulants like amp and methylphenidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people take memantine which allows the NMDA receptor to function but only blocks functionality when it gets over excited. Which helps prevent building tolerance and for many, also potentiated stims. There is a chance it could reduce the effectiveness of say adderall a little, but if over excitement is where someone is getting a lot of the effect from, then the damage is just going to make things a lot worse down the road. Memantine though is also a mild stimulant so the net effect may be increased stimulation while protecting the glutamatergic pathways from excitotoxicity.</p>

<p>Simply getting enough sleep and not taking to many bumps of the stims to extend therapeutic effect is good. Stims like ritalin and adderall cause acute (immediate) tolerance to build so by the afternoon, you need to sometimes double your blood concentration of the active ingredient just to maintain the same therapeutic level. i.e. the recommendation for Adderall is to take it in the morning then take the same dose 4 hours later.  That doubles your blood concentration, but doesn&#39;t double your therapeutic effect, it just keeps it at the same level. Your brain tries to get back to baseline when stimulated and internalizes receptors, literally pulling them into the cell so they can&#39;t be triggered.  So overnight you need a long enough time at a low or zero blood concentration of the drug to convince your brain to upregulate those dopamine and norepinephrine receptors back into play to start from zero tomorrow. Otherwise you can accumulate downregulation of receptors and build tolerance that way.  And higher doses means more ROS.</p>

<p>N-Acetyl-Cysteine is taken to promote generation of glutathione. The primary antioxidant in your body and in almost every cell in your body.  </p>

<p>Vitamin B-Complex is needed to function correctly and reduces ROS and in many cases prevents it from being created. And needed to make glutathione. Along with selenium and zinc. Check the FDA for recommended and upper limits.</p>

<p>The correct intake and ratio of calcium and magnesium is neuroprotective and will prevent extra ROS. Example. need magnesium to protect the NMDA receptor. Too much calcium kicks magnesium out of the cell. etc.</p>

<p>alpha lipoic acid is an antioxidant and can even reactivate other antioxidants after they have been used like vitamin E and C I think. </p>

<p>Just taking a multivitamin to be sure you are not deficient in something will protect from generating extra ROS and also attenuate what is generated. </p>

<p>Alpha GPC or CDP choline boost choline which among other things is used to repair cells damaged from ROS. </p>

<p>Vinpocetine is a prescription drug in other countries but can be bought here as a supplement. It has a laundry list of neuroprotective qualities and the pedigree of being a prescription drug to begin with.</p>

<p>Benfotiamine - drug in Japan I think but B vitamin derivative supplement here. Long story short, increases I think niacin or another B vitamin within the cells which regular supplementation doesn&#39;t increase cellular levels. Result is neuroprotection and other stuff. </p>

<p>SAMe - increases metathione which is neuroprotective and attenuates ROS. But need to take B-Complex with it to prevent it from being turned into homocysteine which you don&#39;t want in your brain.</p>

<p>Other things that help with brain health huperzine A, omega 3s especially EPA and DHA (i,.e. take your fish oil supplement). PQQ, Tudca to prevent apoptosis.</p>

<p>probiotics promote gut health, which increases nutritional absorption, increases detoxification, supports the proper generation of peptides, hormones and other things. And an optimally functioning body reduces ROS generation to begin with. And supports the attenuation of ROS when it is generated.</p>

<p>Eat your fruits and veggies to get a variety of antioxidants . Can boost those by supplementing additional ones derived from various plant sources, but be careful, lots of companies like to cheat on those especially the ones with expensive ingredients.  I like the Now brand Super Antioxidants supplement due to the many phytoflavinoids it contains. </p>

<p>Taurine is neuroprotective among other functions. </p>

<p>Make sure to get 30 to 50 grams of protein a day from various sources to get the amino acids you need from it.  I take an essential amino acids supplement in the morning just to be sure I start off with a good base each day. </p>

<p>curcumin, apigenin, resveratrol, ashwagandha , different types of ginseng. l-theanine, cinnamon, garlic, spermidine, and a million more are all purported to have their effects.</p>

<p>What it comes down to is being able to screen out the BS research from the real stuff and get the most bang for your buck.</p>

<p>VMAT2 upregulation? Methylphenidate also upregulates VMAT2. I&#39;m not sure how modafinil could possibly be neuroprotective if methylphenidate is neurotoxic; modafinil&#39;s effects are practically (not absolutely and literally) a superset of methylphenidate&#39;s. Unless modafinil does something special that completely offsets any possible toxicity from DAT binding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it said a bunch of times that modafinil is neuroprotective. I know it is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist which protects a bit form excitotoxic cascade of the glutamatergic pathway. But forget if there was more to modafinil or not.<br/>
Modafinil targets other areas of the brain stronger than CNS stims. It targets the wakefulness areas and less so on the pre frontal cortex. I forget a lot of what I read about modafinil since it has been a long time since a deeper dive into it.<br/>
But modafinil does not cause tolerance to happen that much compared to CNS stims so it is likely not downregulating or damaging the brain as much if it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, VMAT2 upregulation I read is a factor with modafinil. Where as Amphetamine blocks VMAT2 leaving neurotransmitters in the cytosol to be oxidized into ROS. And some mechanism it causes VMAT2 to either be damaged or downregulated. Amphetamine also downregulates the enzyme that converts tyrosine to dopamine.  And if I recall correctly, amphetamine gets absorbed into mitochondria and messes with that functionality as well.   </p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t read that methylphenidate upregulates VMAT2 so that is interesting. I do know that methylphenidate is also neurotoxic, just not as bad as amphetamine. But I haven&#39;t read up on methylphenidate in a long time since I haven&#39;t been prescribed it in over 15 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glutamate isn&#39;t the primary cause for dopamine toxicity. I&#39;m not sure why so many people seem to think this. Dopamine itself produces downstream metabolites that are toxic, like I explained. Above average levels of glutamate aren&#39;t toxic. Toxic levels of glutamate are toxic. Obsessing over your level of glutamate isn&#39;t a valid strategy in biohacking, unless you have direct proof that this is happening to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>isn’t excess levels of glutamate release seen often in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders by chance? also dopamine in those regards. there’s a paper that just got published as well, emphasizing on how antipsychotic drugs work. at first, scientists thought it worked by blocking the d2 receptors if im not mistaken rather how it actually works is by blocking the d1 receptors. cool stuff! hope it helps a lot of people who suffer from mental disorders. it seems often as glutamate may be the gas and dopamine may be the petal influencing such trajectories. not sure…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the stim is amphetamine based then it is likely damaging NMDA receptor cells and causing excess neurotoxic glutamate. Even if not enough for people who are stable on the same dose long term. But a few articles have mentioned that some researchers believe excitotoxicity of the NMDA receptor to be the primary way amphetamine builds tolerance. More so than the downregulation/internalization of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors or oxidative stress within DA and NE cells, etc.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a good way to test if you are reaching toxic levels of glutamate that I know of. So, hard to know often what is going on and by what mechanism.  Plus the general inaccuracies of going by &quot;feel&quot;.</p>

<p>I can say for myself that it is likely since Strattera repotentiated my Adderall when taken at the same time.  Strattera being a week NMDA receptor antagonist. I assume it was protective enough for things to heal and within a year I found I had gone from 60mg down to a more effective 40mg of Adderall even after stopping Strattera.  Another time I kept taking Strattera even after it seemed not to be effective any more and then I noticed that when I took it, after an hour or so it would decrease the effectiveness of Adderall, which I had taken earlier in the morning and was working by the time I took Strattera. My guess is that it upregulated the NMDA receptors enough so that when I took my dose of strattera that it would block the receptors and mute the effects of Adderall at that point. Since now they were upregulated enough to make a difference. If I had learned all this stuff back then I would not have stopped taking Strattera.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beta Alanine is probably better to take than L-Carnosine. Beta Alanine is the rate limiting factor in generating carnosine. And is much better absorbed than Carnosine. Some think Carnosine gets broken down into its amino acids before absorption any way. So beta alanine should result in more carnosine than taking carnosine itself. And it is far far cheaper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a list in wikipedia if you look up the NMDA receptor I believe. Many others that also help,  I think Strattera and Guaifenesin are an option if handy,  Memantine was derived for the purpose of allowing the receptor to function but blocking over excitement (blocking excitotoxicity).

    <div class="md"><p>It is not a 100 percent solution though. If the NMDA receptors voltage potential is too strong it will still kick out the memantine molecule leaving it open for excitotoxicity. Which is probably a factor why memantine is a mediocre Alzheimer&#39;s drug. They are working on Nitromemantine which doesn&#39;t get kicked out of the way and additionally also blocks the apoptotic cascade that is triggered by excess glutamate if I recall correctly. But I doubt it will be available when it comes out since it will likely be excessively expensive like most new drugs are these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to get off Adderall but am so downregulated and damaged from it over 17 years that I can&#39;t function without it. Dependent but not addicted. So I am stuck with it for a while longer till I can find a neuropsychiatrist who takes ADHD patients and insurance (breen trying for over a year).  Had to stop taking Mounjaro to get my ADHd meds to work again so there goes a bunch of healthy benefits being traded for Adderall. </p>

<p>I have not come across anything about memantine having consequences so I&#39;ll have to look into that more. But I am guessing if someone is taking Adderall, then it is probably better to take memantine with it than not at all considering how badly amphetamine affects NMDA receptors and the glutamatergic system.  No way memanting could mess up my brain and endocrine system as much as Adderall. Plus people who have taken them together all have reported a positive outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen it reported that amphetamine over excites the NMDA receptor causing excitotoxicity and leading to apoptosis of damaged cells. Also that extracellular glutamate receptors (outside the synapse) trigger apoptosis in some types of cells among other molecules released by apoptosis.  And this downregulation of the glutaminergic pathways caused by cell death was the primary factor in tolerance being built up by amphetamine.  Since glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, it does make sense that it could be true.   Can&#39;t say the accuracy though since I didn&#39;t look deeper into the details. But there are many articles with similar topics on glutamate, NMDA, and apoptosis.</p>

<p>There may be something to it. I did take Strattera at the same time as Adderall. It repotentiated Adderall and is a known weak NMDA receptor antagonist which may have allowed normal function but blocked overexcitement and the downstream toxicities and apoptosis. Allowing some recovery too.  When I stopped taking Atomoxetine, I had gone from 60mg generic Adderall IR down to 40mg and that 40 was stronger than when I was at 60. Odd thing is though that after 15 months or so, Atomoxetine would decrease the effectiveness of Adderall When I would take it. Which was why I stopped taking it. Perhaps enough glutaminergic cell damage was repaired and when I took it, it blocked the excitement and reduced the effectiveness. Which at that point outweighed the therapeutic effects of Atomoxetine.  Admittedly speculation as to the mechanisms around what happened, but based on my admittedly limited knowledge it seems possible.   </p>

<p>But yeah, for the various ways amp makes dopamine and norepinephrine toxic through oxidation, NAC or NACET to boost glutathione is a good idea. I had noticed that taking NAC and ALCAR at the same time allowed my brain to keep functioning longer as I got tired than it would without it. Hadn&#39;t tried them separately, but have seen it said they are good to take together. Also to support glutathione, B-complex vitamin and glycine can be taken. There are other supplements but don&#39;t recall off the top of my head.   </p>

<p>Fish oil also helped make Adderall work better, or the effects may have just been the fish oil itself. Don&#39;t know for sure but when I forgot to take it, I was less focused and more tired during the day.  I know DHA is used by the brain in much of the cell structure so that may have allowed better repair of various types of damage caused by it.  And it is said to have other functions in the brain which I forget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you can&#39;t actually look into someone&#39;s brain, you can&#39;t really know for sure.  And there are different types and ways ROS is generated so not likely to be a one size fits all scenario. And drugs may not necessarily be the best thing to take for certain scenarios. Supplements might be better for boosting glutathione and providing other antioxidants and boosting choline. In some cases, eating the right foods.</p>

<p>Legit psychiatrist with more knowledge than others sometimes prescribe memantine with stimulants to protect the NMDA receptor from excitotoxicity caused by stims. You can search. lots of people recommend it for neuroprotection of stims many say it has repotentiated their stims or prevented tolerance.  Wikipedia explains how it works and it is specifically made for the task. Nitromemantine is purported to be better but have yet to find a single place to buy it. I was able to by memantine from <a href="https://cosmicnootropic.com">cosmicnootropic.com</a> but it is expensive.</p>

<p>What you want is something that allows the NMDA receptor to function but only blocks it from getting over excited. memantine would be my first choice. But also look up the calcium and magnesium RDA balance and get the right amount daily and that is also neuroprotective. You want the ratio of calcium to magnesium to be I think (you should double check) between 1.7 to 2.3 or so.  And see how much the RDA and upper limits are. </p>

<p>Prescription Strattera (Atomoxetine) can be used for the NMDA receptor protection. For me it repotentiated my Adderall gowing from 60mg to 40mg daily and countered some of the negative side effects of Adderall. Reducing stims is probably one of the best things to do if possible. </p>

<p>Guaifenesin is also on the list in wikipedia and is OTC expectorant (moistens nasal pathways and chest and can loosen mucus. </p>

<p>&quot;Huperzine A&quot; is on the list and has some other benefits that you can read about on wikipedia. Just a supplement. </p>

<p>l-theanine many people like to take that with stims. For some people it may make them sleepy till they get used to it.</p>

<p>There is a lot more info just on the wiki site for NMDA receptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor</a>.</p>

<p>But that is just the NMDA receptor I have been talking about. Boosting glutathione (bodies primary antioxidant and in almost every cell) helps protect the cells with dopamine and norepinephrine receptors (probably epinephrine and serotonin to a degree too) from stims. And has a ton of other benefits like helping rid the body of trace toxic metals and repotentiating other antioxidants..... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione</a></p>

<p>Too boost glutathione:</p>

<p>take N-acetylcysteine (NAC). I took it with Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR) which itself helps protect mitochondria and RNA within the cells and found that it allowed me to concentrate longer as I was getting tired. Don&#39;t bother taking straight glutathione supplement. It just gets broken down into its component amino acids. NAC is better absorbed and one of the limiting factors of glutathione production. ALCAR I buy from <a href="https://bulksupplemnts.com">bulksupplemnts.com</a> and mix it with my other bulk supplements in water.  NAC has sulfur in it so tastes like crap so I take the Now brand NAC 1000mg supplement tabs instead of the bulk buy.</p>

<p>B-complex is necessary to take. The B vitamins are used in a ton of brain functions and  when not available alternate oxidized substances can be created.  Look for B-complex that doesn&#39;t have too much folate. Too much is bad. And another B-vitamin has an upper limit to look out for but I forget. So you can look that up online. </p>

<p>Also, make sure to get the RDA of your other vitamins and minerals. recommend Se-Methyl-L-Selenocysteine from Life Extensions and Optizinc from Now brand once daily each.  Try to stay below 40mg daily for zinc and 400mg for selenium. These are used in the processes such as your body making glutathione and converting it back to glutathione after it has been oxidized. </p>

<p>Make sure to get 30 to 50 mgs of various proteins daily. Proteins are just chains of amino acids and you need those amino acids for a bunch of stuff. Glutathione is actually 3 amino acids stuck together.   </p>

<p>eating lots of veggie&#39;s and fruits will give a variety of antioxidants that target different areas. Blueberries have a lot of research behind them compared to others so best bet, eat some each week. I hate fruit so drink Pom Wow with blubbery juice. Don&#39;t know how much of the good stuff is retained when turned to juice, but the alternative makes me gag.  And if it&#39;s all hype, better to drink that than soda.</p>

<p>Getting enough choline which is used in cell structures and needed for repair, generating new cells, and boosting acetylcholine which is used in memory among other things and may have mild stimulating effects itself. Alpaha GPC and CDP Choline boost choline (which is also found in meats and other foods). Take one or the other but not both since too much choline can make you sleepy. </p>

<p>EPA and especially DHA omega 3 oils are used in the structure of the brains cells among other uses. I find when I forget to take my supplement for it, my Adderall doesn&#39;t work as well the next day. I used to take it before bed, but it is best to be taken with food for better absorption. Also omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and are therefore protectant in that respect.  i.e. fish oil supplements. <a href="https://www.barleans.com/">https://www.barleans.com/</a> is a really good brand for various omega oils but can also be expensive.  Also Spring Valley Walmart brand 2000mg  has a few variations of their product that are good. Look for the one with the most DHA. EPA is more heart healthy and DHA more brain. I get prescribed Lovaza so that solves it for me.</p>

<p>Should be more than enough info posted to get anyone started.</p>
