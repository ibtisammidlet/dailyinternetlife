        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to be addicted to gabaergic drugs in the past. Namely phenibut as it was a god send for social anxiety and generally being motivated enough to actually talk to people, go out and socialise.</p>

<p>Having a healthy diet, exercising and “scheduling” myself to have a social life helped to an extent but this does not last or did not last for me. The more I tried harder, the more it would push me away from doing those activities as it was too stressful which led to more isolation.</p>

<p>I have tried many other drugs for this and nothing could touch the “edge” that phenibut had. Agmatine sulfate was close, it destroyed anxiety and depression, however it made me quite irritable and it didn’t PUSH me to start conversations.</p>

<p>Bromantane solo was even closer. 4 sprays of Bromantane and it was anxiolytic. However, after a couple hours, I became irritable and aggressive. It pushed me more towards working on goals but I was antisocial unless spoken to.</p>

<p>Guanfacine came in the post today so I proceeded to try 1mg of it with 4 sprays of Bromantane. After a couple hours, it felt like magic. Bromatane’s motivation enhancement effect was obviously enhanced. My talkativeness and willingness to socialise was GREATER than when on phenibut. Phenibut is absolute TRASH compared to this. That’s how good it is.</p>

<p>Reducing noradrenaline is a better solution than increasing GABA as you can still retain your cognition as well as targeting the main issue. </p>

<p>Personally, I think having an abusive childhood made me have an overactive fight-or-flight system which made my anxiety shoot through the roof at small situations. Getting frustrated and aggressive easily was a huge issue as well. Probably due to getting constantly beaten up by teachers as a child. </p>

<p>The ingestion of TAK-653 actually made me unlock these memories, put the puzzle pieces together and realise that I needed Guanfacine due to research on noradrenaline and the fight-or-flight system. It was an absolute god send for this. </p>

<p>Thank you u/sirsadalot for waking up the world.</p>

<p>Edit: Like others mentioned, it is better to wait a month before writing a review. It has been 10 days and I’ve noticed a few changes. The hypomania did stop, however, it still managed to help my social anxiety. I noticed on my Fitbit that my heart rate was decreasing every day and eventually went to 55 rhr which is bradycardia and potentially dangerous. </p>

<p>I decided to stop Guanfacine and in the following days, it went back up to 60. However, the effects of social anxiety reduction still persisted, even without Bromantane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not always as simple as reducing or increasing a certain neurotransmitter. </p>

<p>Personally Guanfacine or Clonidine just make me lethargic and make no difference to anxiety. Bromantane actually increases my anxiety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Everyone’s different and have their own neurochemistry. </p>

<p>GABA drugs worked a dream for me but Guanfacine worked way better for anxiety and socialising. GABA drugs made me stupid, disinhibited and impaired my memory and motor skills so I would do stupid shit and forget about it. </p>

<p>This is not ideal for day to day life as you have plenty of bad decisions to then recover from and there is also the rebound and withdrawal aspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does bromentane have any known side effects especially with taking it guanfacine? </p>

<p>I was on phenibut 2 years back trying to fix my anxiety issue myself since I had a worthless GP. Ended up with extreme withdrawal from it and took me 3 months to recover. </p>

<p>Never touching shit like that again. That’s why I’m adamant on nootropics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Increased libido and that can be good or bad. Since you were taking phenibut, it’s probably a good thing because I know phenibut withdrawal tanks your libido.</p>

<p>I haven’t felt any interactions with Guanfacine myself but everyone is different so I would try both of them separately first to gauge how they feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, this is probably overkill but thought I would share. </p>

<p>On TAK-653, 2mg a day. (I titrated up to this) 
Bromantane, IN (intranasal) one spray each nostril. Special formula. </p>

<p>I supplement with sublingual Bromantane for severe hormone fluctuations that happen once a month. Most people only do one or the other. I noticed that I get an immediate effect from the intranasal but need to increase my Bromantane usage one week out of the month. I get severe avoidance, anxiety and procrastination. </p>

<p>Intranasal Bromantane has almost an immediate effect. Clear head with energy that is calm and no crash. The sublingual Bromantane is more of a cumulative effect. </p>

<p>I also take P21 IN once a day cycled 6 months then break. 
NA Semax Amidate IN 
NA Selank Amidate IN </p>

<p>Just stopped P21 to take a cycle break. The Semax is as needed for alert, brain fog clearing and focus. One spray each nostril one to two times a day before 2pm. I don&#39;t take it late due to the need to sleep at night.</p>

<p>The Selank is for evening time for sleep. I&#39;m getting more REM sleep with it. One spray each nostril as needed before bed.</p>

<p>I work in a brain specialty clinic where we have access to wireless qEEG&#39;s. I hope to test out my brain processing speed and brain waves next week to see how my research does with the TAK. I have a brain injury so I track my progress with noots and neuro peptides that I take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It won’t replace vyvanse so don’t expect the same effects it’s not that type of stimulant. It’s subtle, makes you feel a little bit better than baseline but also sometimes nothing at all. The most powerful thing about Bromantane is its ability to subtly get you out of laziness but that’s about it. It’s so subtle and there’s no euphoria behind it. It also makes you irritable and more prone to OCD type symptoms. </p>

<p>I am still taking Bromantane just whenever I feel like it maybe once or twice every other week or so.</p>

<p>It will definitely up-regulate dopamine though it will be great once you come off vyvanse if that’s the plan for you. </p>

<p>If you want a replacement for vyvanse in the meantime you may want to try more stimulating drugs which are safer like modafinil or semax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the informative reply! I’m not looking for euphoria or a high after quitting Vyvanse I just want to speed up the process of healing my brain from down regulated dopamine. </p>

<p>Is Brom best in the nasal spray or sublingually?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that. I’m going to order that now. Do you think bromantane by itself will be good enough for re-sensitizing my receptors or should I also add in ALCAR? If I should run both, how should I take them? </p>

<p>Both the same day or Brom one day and ALCAR the next and so on? Like MWF ALCAR &amp; TUE,THUR,SUN Brom?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend none of these supplements will get you where you want to be with respect to social anxiety. You must realise that social anxiety is just a thought based upon many assumptions your mind has created, and now you identify with the thought as if it was true and part of you. I recommend some serious mindfulness practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t make me laugh 🤣 mindfulness will only help to a certain extent. I have already tried stuff like that and have been trying to work on this for years. </p>

<p>Everyone has different neurochemistry and it isn’t as simple as “mindfulness practice”. Sure, it may work for some minor cases but a bit of meditation will not solve social anxiety. </p>

<p>Exposure therapy will help however, it can also lead to events too stressful which requires the use of medicine to at least try exposure therapy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider social anxiety and it’s origins. It is almost entirely a feedback loop of negative thoughts, which you identify with, they create more negative emotion, and the cycle begins again. Medications help with those, but supplements won’t even come close. Even medications, after you stop taking them the suffering caused by the idea of the self will return. You need to understand where you’re suffering truly comes from</p>
