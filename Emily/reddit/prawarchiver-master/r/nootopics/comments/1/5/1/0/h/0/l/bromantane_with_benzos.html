<p>We often recommend DHH-B to help get off of Benzos. It&#39;s used in Japan and other countries to help people get off benzos but not widely known in the US. Should be pharma quality not Amazon. DHH-B is made from magnolia bark but taking magnolia bark is not the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Benzos are the first thing we get patients off of. Slows your processing speed. We can see it on the brain mapping (qEEGs) that we do in real time. It slows down the brain and makes it sleepy. Have you tried DHH-B yet? It is made from Magnolia bark. However do not use Magnolia bark it is not the same. I get pharma grade DHH-B. I recommend it to a lot of our patients on benzos and those with high anxiety. I&#39;m on zero meds now except for levothyroxine (thyroid) and Everychem&#39;s Bromantane and TAK-653 and occasionally NA Selank. First time in 25 years I&#39;m not on anti depressants. I had <em>severe</em> major depressive disorder with long Covid the past 3 years. Hope you find some relief!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awwww thank you u/Tiny_E_NYC I get it from EveryChem. I am passionate about helping others who face the same or similar challenges. </p>

<p>They have affordable and small batches. They are a very unique supplier that truly cares about brain health. </p>

<p>The developer /mastermind<br/>
<a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> develops each masterful formula for my research. Rare for me to work in a brain specialty clinic and have something this well thought out and formulated because he cares. </p>

<p>And yes, I&#39;m a fan girl. There isn&#39;t any other place quite like EveryChem. You will see from their website. :)
BTW I receive no discounts or freebies for sharing my experiences about them. I just believe in their formulations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TAK-653 worked amazing for my anhedonia twice but then never really had an effect again. Do you know why that may be? It worked at 1 mg and 2 mg and now even if I do 3-4 mg it doesn‚Äôt really do much</p>

<p>Benzos or pregabalin do help my anhedonia but cant take them often. Armodafinil kinda helps too but builds tolerance. Other than that the best is probably when I cycle MIF-1 but it has to be cycled every month which is a big limitation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would stay away from Benzos. Have you tried Bromantane (ingested liquid) with TAK? That seems to be the magic combo for me.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting - im unable to find reference though. Im about to switch from memantine to bromantane - and Im using 150-200mg baclofen daily alongside, to stop alcohol cravings.
Shall they not interfere?
Also by the way - im years into co-usage of daily memantine, high dose cbd, alcohol, benzos, stimulants - and my long term memory, and also attention and cognitive performance is silly - my bet is i shall maintain abstinence, gonna start phenelzine, switch from memantine to bromantane, add tropisterone - anything else comes to mind, which main things could help?
Im also going for microdosing of psylo and lions manes along many other things like ldn, training and so.
I drank and took benzos and stims for years and years and now im afraid how wrecked my brainz may be. Any insight about how to approach glutamate/gaba/thismuchmess healing?
Does TAK make sense here? Maybe some specific racetam?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really notice it - honestly i never did, after trying to abuse it after abusing phenibut and gbl.
There was a study (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540966/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540966/</a>) that inspired me to try it - after all, i was drinking so destructivelly and im after so much (from childhood years i was diagnosed with tourette syndrome - no drugs from the biggest caliber did help till i started self medicating with marijuana at 16yo and spiraled into polyaddiction) that i do not hestiate trying such tools.
Overall through my life they and then i had myself through the drug store shelves and substances of all kinds - i used to anyway decide what to medicate me with - now the doc don&#39;t even ask why and what anymore, he&#39;s too old and he knows it and trust me and my research abilities).
As for WDs - i should, but if i do stop, that means im binge drinking and then im back to baclofen - and im on it maybe third month, raising my dosages - it&#39;s not long term yet but it probably will be).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may want to look at low dose Tirzepatide for binge drinking. It has to mechanisms in the brain versus its competitor and it has neuro effects that regulate addiction.

    <div class="md"><p>I started last year late October microdosing once a week. Did a test dose the last week of Oct. 2022 of only 250mcg. I wanted to make sure that my test subject wasn&#39;t allergic. Did fine so increased dose to 500mcg once a week. Did a micro titration every week adding one to two units a week. Took me 6 months to get from 500mcg to 2mg. Took me 9 months to get to 5mg. I now am at 5mg weekly. Test subject lost a lb a week even on the micro dose. Nine months in and down 28 lbs. The plan was to lose slowly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Already on it and surely will stay; along that, NAC, BSO, alcar, ala, creatine, omega3, vit C, magnesium taurate/magnesium acetyl taurinate, zinc, bcomplex and futurely cdp choline are a solid staple for me. Also considering lithium orotate and whether will it interfere with psylocybine microdosing. I feel like that&#39;s some risky grounds im stepping through and Im afraid of what would going cold turkey cause (im cosidering a year off at inpatient rehab but they decline to acknowledge even the names of things im taking, so rather was considering).
Im totally overdoing it with cbd for years (up to few hundred mgs daily sublingually) and feel it&#39;s time to drop it so maybe some palmitoylethanolamide gonna take it&#39;s place. Also goin back on 10mg of preganolone and dhea soon after final decisions and plans are made and after my next hormones blood panel. Readding dlpa also once im on my next schedule and start regular trainings.
Recently added glycine and thinking about sarcosine/d-serine - or probably rather some of the novelities from our wonderfull source of knowledge (thinking about my long term damped nmdar but im not really knowledgeable here so i hope for some insight).</p>

<p>Might be a good idea to use NAC and/ or tropisetron to accelerate benzodiazepine quitting</p>

<p>As in cancels out the effect of phenibut or resets tolerance of phenibut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No issues with this combo. I&#39;ve taken both for quite a while and never had a problem. Given my understanding of bromantane&#39;s pharmacology, it&#39;s unlikely GABAergics would pose any sort of problem if taken concurrently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IKR. I had major surgery on my turbinates, deviated septum, nasal valve collapse (long Covid) back in January.</p>

<p>Started your Bromantane 3 weeks after surgery, switched from liquid sublingual to yours. Just saw my ENT colleague last week and I asked her, no issues with my nose post surgery due to Bromantane. The caprylic acid actually helps keep my mucosa from getting dry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I sort of feel like it gave me those effects too. Not what I expected when it seemed like gods gift to most peoples anecdotal experiences. Was quite the opposite in terms of anxiety and being stimulating. The only thing I can say is you can get more baseline motivation that is really it. No euphoria, lifted mood, any of the usual stuff you would expect from something like that, kind of worthless in my book and I feel like it did take away from the positive mindset I was building beforehand. I feel like I easily reverted back to negative pessimistic outlooks once I started bromantane and am still trying to fix it after stopping usage. Also think it did damage to mucous membranes and probably used less than half the bottle 1-2 sprays at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may want to look at low dose Tirzepatide for binge drinking. It has to mechanisms in the brain versus its competitor and it has neuro effects that regulate addiction. I know someone who has binge drinking and drinks two bottles of wine at night. They started on Tirzepatide and within 2 weeks it all stopped. I know this person and check in with them often. </p>

<p>I actually microdose Tirz for it&#39;s neuro anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<p>I just started TAK-653 and take it with intranasal Bromantane.</p>
