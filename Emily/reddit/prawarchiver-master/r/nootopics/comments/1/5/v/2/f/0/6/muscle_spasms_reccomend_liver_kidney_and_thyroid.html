        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I been noticing almost consistent muscle spasms/twitches almost involuntary movements in my fingers, hands, shoulder, stomach, arm, ever since I started NSI-189  during use. I stopped use like 3 days ago after using for about a month. Still getting muscle spasms though.Also noticed my bowel when I go to the bathroom sometimes can be slightly gray, sometimes but also since I don’t eat as much I’m im prone to weird bowel movements. But I read it can be a sign of liver issues</p>

<p>Caffeine seems to exacerbate the spasms or in general stimulants do. I do also take a ton of different substances and have been so it could be the case that my liver, kidneys, or thyroid has issues now. Gonna get blood work tommorow to confirm. For the substances I use pretty regularly, I picked up a nicotine vaping habit like 2 months ago after going w the crowd at work who seem to all vape. I also use TAK, Caffeine (200-600mg depending on my tolerance,) vyvanse, agmatine,  also take a sleep supplements which contains chamomile extract, l theanine, melatonin, lemon balm extract, passion flower ext,  I also take,  valerian, cannabigerol, rosemary extract std 20% carnosic acid, I used to to take gotu kola and Bacopa as well but haven’t been recently. as for my diet, it’s pretty shit. </p>

<p>As in I don’t eat as much as I should in a day. Sometimes I’ll eat one meal in a day + cereal sometimes less sometimes a little more. Since I’m kind of worried rn about possible kidney/liver issues I’ve started taking alpha lipoic acid, milk thistle, COQ-10, cordyceps sinensis, and black seed oil(nigella sativa). Also ofc lowering my “damaging” substance use until I get the blood work results. Please reccomend substances I can use to improve liver, kidney, &amp; thyroid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NSI-189 mechanism doesn&#39;t work like that, you&#39;re taking Vyvanse which causes such. Titrate off the Vyvanse, and once completely off substitute magnesium, if symptoms persist look into guanfacine, and if improvement isn&#39;t satisfactory take 2mg abilify and titrate up with guanfacine. Take TUDCA and NAC for your liver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ended up seeing the doctor and going to the ER cause I had a panic attack bc I thought I was having a heart attack. I had my heart, liver, thyroid, and kidneys all tested with a blood test + EKG + x ray And everything came out fine. I didn’t tell the doctor I was on NSI but I did mention my vyvanse and caffeine use</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would mention NSI-189 next time, a doctor in the US is mainly wants to make sure there&#39;s no complications. I assume it was the caffeine and Vyvanse, if you already have an anxiety disorder, I advise to stay away from caffeine in general. Fortunately those test seem fine. I recommend maybe trying some L-theanine to help with symptoms of anxiety, but also it has it&#39;s limitations in effectiveness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quit vyvanse, take methylphenidate instead (preferably focalin, low dose). Amphetamine is neurotoxic.</p>

<p>3 days isn’t long when talking about NSI. The half life is up to 20 hours, and if you had a lot build up in your system over the month of use it could take multiple days just to leave your body. Plus the effects of NSI on nerves last for a while after use. It’s really likely you’ll go back to normal over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about your liver, take TUDCA, that’s all you really need. Stop alpha lipoid acid, it could transport mercury into your brain if you have any in your body from eating fish. Muscle spasms have nothing to do with your liver.</p>

<p>You’re probably a hypochondriac, so just chill out. Some weird stuff if likely to happen to your body when taking barely-studied research chemicals. Doesn’t at all mean you’re screwed for life. Just chill out, take your mind off it, and it’ll go back to normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen hypochondria been mentioned in a slideshow about migraines, that hypochondriacs in past descriptions might actually have experienced that.</p>

<p>I guess hypochondria can have a very real physical cause.</p>

<p>Furthermore, aside of a bunch of diseases being undiagnosed, there might be some which could have a very prevalent connection to hypochondria. </p>

<p>I think the vagal nerve, which is central to interoception and related to migraines, might have a correlation. Dysfunction can make people quite unable to get a grip on what exactly it is they are experiencing, while also causing weird symptoms that hypochondriacs might describe. </p>

<p>This inability to figure such prevelant dysfunction out on their own might make them seek out attention, while being unable to actually describe/communicate it effectively enough</p>
