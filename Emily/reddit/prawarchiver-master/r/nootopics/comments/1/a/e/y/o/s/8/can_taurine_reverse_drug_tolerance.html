    <div class="md"><p>Alcar with potent antioxidant (ALA or PQQ ..) reverse tolerance to stimulants more than any NMDA antagonist . The key is to use bigger dose (3g) to prevent Alcar crash , and use it no more than 3 times per week to prevent thyroid problems which I had experienced. Lower doses lead to crash later in day . Taurine made me drowsy and I experienced severe rebound and anxiety-like sympoms the next day, every time I took it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I don&#39;t use powerful stimulant like adderall, I use modafinil, but I use tianeptine sodium which is prescribed to me (12.5 mg x 3). The day after 3g of Alcar, I could feel tianeptine sodium mood-boosting effects more than without it. </p>

<p>Nmda antagonists, even weaker ones like magnesium threonate give me slight dissociation and fatigue the following days. Don&#39;t let me begin with agmatine and memantine. </p>

<p>Taking Alcar every single day loses its benefits, and I start experiencing hypothyroid-like symptoms (swollen eyelids, physical weakness, fatigue, caffeine lasting 1 hour instead of 5 hours, modafinil not working, etc.). </p>

<p>Alcar is strange because it made me lose weight regardless if I experienced these symptoms or not, and I am a bit underweight.</p>

<p>Now, about alcar crash. 500mg of alcar feels like it lasts 4 hours max, then there is a very noticeable crash, mainly weakness and slight headache. If I dose 3 grams in the morning, the effects last the whole day and I crash at the perfect time just before bed. The next day caffeine, modafinil, and tianeptine seem a bit stronger. </p>

<p>If I start taking alcar without carbs I begin to experience hypoglycemia and start feeling jittery and weak </p>

<p>I am planning to drop tianeptine after being 8 months on it, while it helps depression and anxiety, it makes me fatigued and worsens my ADHD. It also overpowers modafinil</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. Thanks for responding. I’m a fan of Agmatine been using it for years on and off. I got no symptoms I’m still debating whether it hinders or helps benzodiazepines. 
Coming off, it’s great. The NMDA receptors are inhibiting and with small amounts of DXM I can take a few days off benzodiazepines even after using day largish amounts (4-8mg clonazepam, 10mg Diaz).<br/>
What I’m interested in adding to the stack ALCAR but careful how any of my other supplements might through this out. 
I have 
B1, niacin, niacinamide, NAD+, Glutathione, NAC, GABA, etc. 
trying to study GABA b, CNS, NMDA agonists/antagonists it’s not easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taurine is a gaba agonist and glutamate blocker prolly why you had rebound anxiety.   I know a lot about this stuff and I have a love affair with gaba agonists and dopamine agonists.  So I&#39;ve abused phenibut the king of gaba b up to 15 grams a day and went straight too hell cold turkeyed, I also have done my share of benzos and alcohol withdrawl many times and I&#39;ve heard of people getting rebound from Taurine and things like apigenin and magnolia bark, but I have taken massive doses of all 3 at a time and never get any rebound?  I wonder if my gaba glutamate system is just way out of wack or something from all the abuse 😂  or? Maybe the hell I went through from withdrawl made any rebound just seem line nothing?  Anyways tanks for listening to my crazy 🤪</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just use Memantine, Agmatine, or DXM for stimulant tolerance. NMDA antagonists don&#39;t lower tolerance to stimulants like they do with opioids, they only potentiate them and slow down the buildup of tolerance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly disagree. First, is NMDA antagonists definitely don&#39;t potentiate stimulants. Try taking Adderall with agmatine and without it. You&#39;ll find agmatine actually does the exact opposite and blunts some of the effects of the Adderall. Second, They reverse tolerance. I&#39;ve used ketamine to get off Kratom, Suboxone, Phenibut, and Amphetamine (Vyvanse). If you do it correctly using a journal, documenting the dose, and your symptoms; you can actually get off substances without feeling ANY withdrawal. When I finally got my dosing protocol right; I was able to get off the substances I needed without withdrawal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reference to my first reply, here is one study about NMDA antagonists potentiating Cocaine, I suggest you do more research on your own for the other studies that say it about other stimulants, as researching yourself is the best way to learn.

    <div class="md"><p>They do not reverse tolerance to stimulants, that is what I said. Only opioids and GABAergics, and if you&#39;ll give me a moment, I will cite the studies that state NMDA antagonists do potentiate stimulants. Agmatine is not just an NMDA antagonist and has other actions that may blunt stimulant effects.
I have taken NMDA antagonists with stimulants and have noticed an extreme potentiation, and there are studies supporting what I&#39;m saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I&#39;m not going to argue with you. I&#39;m here to help educate the people who are trying to help themselves. I literally did it myself. Don&#39;t hate if you don&#39;t have experience with it because the people who are actually trying to better themselves see your post, they will get the wrong idea and potentially go in the other direction. All because someone without experience is trying to pretend like they know what they&#39;re talking about. The job of the NMDA receptor is to hold &quot;memory&quot; within your molecules. So, antagonizing the &quot;memory&quot; reverses tolerance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have experience with it myself, and I literally provided a study proving what I said. You just sound really butthurt and can&#39;t accept when you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>Anecdotes are not everything, that&#39;s now how scientific evidence works. Studies matter too.
And your subpar &quot;explanation&quot; of what NMDA receptors control is laughable. The role of glutamate receptors goes far far beyond what you say, and it goes so far that even the top scientists don&#39;t fully understand it.</p>

<p>I graduated with my PharmD and degree in Neuropsychopharmacology, I think I would know a bit more about this stuff than some random dude on Reddit who thinks they&#39;re right based only off of their own anecdotal evidence. Pharmacological actions and effects are EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE, just because you experience one thing doesn&#39;t make only that one thing the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude!  Basically I l9ve gaba agonists mainly phenibut and last year I took 15 grams a day for 6 months and went to hell for 8 weeks cold turkeyed.  And I think I permanently fucked my brain because I found out your not supposed to do that?  So now I have kindling bad especially the 12 different withdrawal from alcohol didn&#39;t help.  But I l9ve phenibut too much so I came up with a plan I hope?  I got memantine fasoracetam and baclofen for after I binge phenibut for 2 to 3 weeks to hopefully taper and get off without going to hell. And then I would only use fasoracetam and kratom for a couple weeks to unregulate and the start the 2 week binge again, I&#39;m almost done with the 2 weeker but have not done memantine or fasoracetam yet wish me luck 🤞</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely give my offer my opinion. I don&#39;t think your protocol is going to work out the way you are hoping it to. I&#39;ve tried getting off multiple substances with multiple types of nmda antagonists and can confirm that Memantine isn&#39;t a strong enough NMDA antagonist to accomplish what you&#39;re trying to. I would say even Ketamine wouldn&#39;t accomplish the result you&#39;re trying to receive. Even if you combined the two. Phenibut SIGNIFICANTLY down-regulates your gaba receptors. I&#39;ve had trouble with it too. Not only does it down-regulate the gaba b receptor; but, something that most people aren&#39;t aware of is that it also minorally down-regulates the gaba a receptor too. A 2-3 week binge is too long. I would even say a 1 week binge would be a little challenging due to the rebound anxiety it will bring. It has such a long mode of action. I would personally only use it 2-4x a week at the most. But, only 4x a week if using ketamine, fasoracetam, and cortexin to mitigate tolerance, increase the rate of upregulation of your gaba b receptor, and help normalize/increase plasticity to help your body be able to adapt to changes; like being on and off a certain substance and slow NMDA activation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. Yes, DXM is a cough ingredient. It’s a dissociative which will trip you out at high doses (just like anti histamines). 
But u want DXM by itself. This is easily findable. 
DXM is NMDA inhibitor and together with Agmatine it makes benzo withdrawal easier.</p>

After, reading the studies and getting the dosing protocol on point; not only was I able to reverse tolerance, but I was able to get off of all the drugs I needed to WITHOUT any withdrawal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve taken it for years and I do not think it can do that at least not on my body. I also don&#39;t use stimulants though. I use taurine for the health benefits for the brain and testicles and much more. Don&#39;t think it will do much for reversing drug tolerance though, it&#39;s an amino acid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read a lot of people saying a lot but the answer in practically is “probably not” you can cite all the research you want or give your partially educated opinions… it’s just taurine.</p>

<p>maybe I’m totally wrong making the assumption so I’d  Google “taurine drug tolerance”<br/>
Or just try it but i wouldn’t get my hopes up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taurine is a gaba agonist and glutamate blocker prolly why you had rebound anxiety.   I know a lot about this stuff and I have a love affair with gaba agonists and dopamine agonists.  So I&#39;ve abused phenibut the king of gaba b up to 15 grams a day and went straight too hell cold turkeyed, I also have done my share of benzos and alcohol withdrawl many times and I&#39;ve heard of people getting rebound from Taurine and things like apigenin and magnolia bark, but I have taken massive doses of all 3 at a time and never get any rebound?  I wonder if my gaba glutamate system is just way out of wack or something from all the abuse 😂  or? Maybe the hell I went through from withdrawl made any rebound just seem line nothing?  Anyways tanks for listening to my crazy 🤪</p>
