        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m taking a few classes in advanced probability. I generally struggle with proof-based math and have to devote a lot of time to really grasp the intuition behind new concepts. There&#39;s no way around the time-commitment, but I want to develop a stack which will equip me to tackle new problems with greater confidence. To this end, I wish to increase the speed at which I digest abstract concepts. I&#39;d also like to more easily retrieve those concepts from my memory and incorporate them into my thoughts without as much strain. <strong>What are the very best substances for the achievement of this goal?</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Cerebrolysin has made the biggest difference in my cognition.  However, I have discovered that the desirable changes to mental fluidity, verbal fluency, and sharpness that it gave me at first have all begun to gradually fade with each successive use. Interestingly, pregnenolone has brought some of those effects back.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a hyper-responder to piracetam, but it definitely works when I pair it with choline. When I take 5g+, I perceive a more clear headspace (e.g. the absence of brain fog) and don&#39;t get as fatigued with cognitively demanding tasks. It can make me a little quick to anger, but that&#39;s the only negative side-effect that I&#39;ve noticed-- I&#39;m self-aware enough that it&#39;s not a problem. As the effect accumulates, piracetam improves my verbal fluency and I feel sharper, but I don&#39;t think it has made a big impact on my memory.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Other than piracetam, I have limited experience with racetams. Phenylpiracetam, especially in combination with cerebrolysin, gives me great fatigue resistance and enables me to tackle monotonous tasks with a little more gusto. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to make me smarter. Perhaps that&#39;s because I haven&#39;t used it for prolonged periods due to its steep tolerance.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have tried using PRL-8-53, but I haven&#39;t had the same success as the first administration, when I studied some past homework right before an exam and found that I could remember them in great detail when I encountered analogous problems.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to improve upon my current stack. I&#39;m open to anything in any price bracket. In addition to the substances below, I have access to bromantane nasal spray, TAK-653, Cortexin, Tropisetrin, Fasoracetam, and NSI-189. I&#39;m a bit reluctant to take the NSI-189 because I dream vividly every evening. I would like to avoid depersonalization / derealization at all costs, especially because I have many intense psychedelic experiences under my belt and don&#39;t wish to become delusional. No family history of schizophrenia, though I do have generalized anxiety disorder (very well-managed, essentially asymptomatic).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>ALCAR IS A MUST HAVE</strong></p>

<p>i think as a rule of thumb you can expect any cholinergic substance to help noticably with this, in some aspects. If not it must be some exception. (Thus also look in this direction)</p>

<p>But.. from those, ALCAR did to me exactly what you ask for. I did not expect that to happen, but it did. Aupplementing ALCAR for a period of time somehow impactdully expanded my cognitive mathmatical abilities, mainly in conceptual thinking, by means of visualisation.</p>

<p>I remember <strong>huperizine A</strong> also helped me (long ago). This was one of the only compounds that felt like a true (small but noticably) IQ boost. But Im afraid it can make my muscles tense up too much. Perhaps there is a therapeutic window in regards to avoiding escalating aide effects.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember the names and all, but there are multiple things involved in acetylcholinergic regulation. I saw a supplement that had Huperizine A and <em>Eleutherococcus senticosus</em>(<strong>Eleuthero</strong>) while reading about this. I checked out what Eleuthero could do in this regard. It happens to be beneficial somewhere down the cascade before where Huperizine A does its job..</p>

<p>..So taking <strong><em>Eleuthero alongside Huperizine</em></strong> A is likely beneficial. Maybe you need to lower both doses a bit, maybe not.</p>

<p><strong><em>Others that MIGHT help:</em></strong><br/>
<strong>Oxyracetam</strong>, it also boosts the cholinergic system and enhances color. So it very likely will help in visualising abstract mathmatical concepts if you add this.</p>

<p><strong>Microdose LSD</strong> improves connectivity to the visual system ... And whatever. Don&#39;t know exactly what it does but you can imagine it helping. It notably enhances color in a non-static way, it is more dynamic. On a high dose I could spawn in things visually like an awake-ludic_drean</p>

<p><strong><em>PRL-8-53</em></strong> helps with short term memory, but only tested on verbal short term memory. Is also cholinergic but likely additionally dopamine/norepinephrine is involved</p>

<p><strong>Ampakines</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>D-serine</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time I did it for about a year I think. Now back on it since a few months. Via nicotinic receptors it can actually sensitize itself, other nicotinic agonists and dopamine. But yes, besides sensitisation desensitisation can also occur, this can be prevented perhaps even reversed by nmda antagonism (so take magnesium L-threonate, memantine/bromantane, agmatine or other nmda antagonist alongside. Don&#39;t take anything that impairs you like a recreational ketamine dose tho)</p>

<p>It is more complex than this btw, you can use other strategies, but this part i talked about it true, that nmda antagonism prevents tolerance and dopamine(rgics) and activity at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors sensitize each other</p>

<p>Perhaps you can also add ABT-089 and Tropisetron to your arsenal, because they also work in this system. But I don&#39;t know if they themselves help with visualisation specifically, I do know they both raise IQ</p>

<p>It indirectly increases the endegenous ahonist: acetylcholine</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s been your experience with Tropisetron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly can&#39;t tell much about it, but theoretically it&#39;d be very beneficial for me. Its also anti inflammatory and orevents nausea (hate that feeling). And allows cognitive flexibility without being like an in your face interuotion.</p>

<p>Abt-089 felt like it increased the bandwith of my field of focus. Or perhaps increased the depth/the gravity to the sides of what I&#39;d normally think about, without standing in the way of what I want to think about. It like helped me  think about more (beneficial)topics per day(like joining a sport or something), so I&#39;m behaviourally more flexible</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may interact with Sertraling. Although I understand that psychedelics &amp; SSRI-combo mostly just blunts psychedelic effect via excess serotonin blocking those receptors where LSD is supposed to go into doing its trick. So mayby better skip that for that reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you&#39;re curious, I have a lot of experience with sertraline &amp; psychedelics. Your intuition is correct, but you have the wrong mechanism in mind.  </p>

<p>The majority of sertraline&#39;s effects are derived from the desensitization of the serotonin receptors. Receptors desensitize in response to higher concentrations of ligand, which is what happens with serotonin when you take SSRIs like sertraline.</p>

<p>Psychedelics have substantially greater affinities for the serotonin receptor than serotonin itself, so although the two substances compete for the same receptor, the receptor dynamics are essentially the same as in SSRI-naive brains. In brains accustomed to SSRIs, psychedelics are less intense because the serotonin receptors are simply less sensitive, not because the psychedelic needs to shove its way through a thick crowd of serotonin to get to its receptor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that was cool elaborate answer. </p>

<p>I just had vague memory in mind from some doctor book on interactions with anti-depressants &amp; psychedelics, stating that SSRIs in general weaken response whereas tricyclic antidepressants of older generation may intensify them, and lithium too intensifies them. That was like 20-30 year old text what did not talk about mechanisms. </p>

<p>But lithium orotate microdose could be good add-on in stack if you are doing micodosing of psychedelics and want to keep the dose low?? </p>

<p>I have read that not tricyclic, but tetracyclic antidepressant Ludiomil could significantly alter and potentiate LSD trip and provide lucid dreams for nights a week after that. Not tried, but one may assume that tricyclic antidepressants what are nowadays prescribed less may do something like that. Intense dreams were reported by friends who got those by prescription on their own, or borderline dreams as side effect wherein you was not aware if you had awaken or still in dream what were unpleasant. Tricyclic called Tolvon was sought-after by drug users due of that ability especially. </p>

<p>(Ampakine) racetams are said to potentiate psychedelics as well, so best to keep in mind if stacking with Piracetam and then considering some microdosing on top of it.</p>
