        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last friday I took NAC with few supplements I remember - CoQ10, 5htp, and probably ashwaganda. I might have took one or two other supplements, too.</p>

<p>I took them for anxiety. It was so cruel, I couldn&#39;t do anything or rest. But I was barely able to play guitar, and I was able to play my heart out. So I do regret not sticking onto playing guitar.
But as I took the supplements, along the relief from the anxiety, an amazing amount of darkness has come into my head and I had to lie down somewhere, and stayed there for almost two hours with a completely blank mind. But I was able to sense some kind of a very heavy feeling.
After I regained conscious, I had to move to my bed and slept there for another hour or two. Maybe shorter.</p>

<p>Then I woke up and felt nothing was left. Anxiety was still there but less, but the problem is that I had no feeling, no thoughts, no depth on anything. I simply became a sick, ill, irritated child being stuck in an adult&#39;s body. This is such a bad description, but I can&#39;t do any better at the moment. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been very sick since that day&#39;s night, calling random person and getting rejected, which gave me enormous pain to my feelings, which led to a physical pain, and I had to spend the night feeling pain from every thoughts that pop inside my head and could not get up from the bed the next day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been very sick ever since. Not only my body, but my mind is just as blank. I still don&#39;t have anything from my previous self anymore. There&#39;s no sign of return. </p>

<p>Can anyone relate to this? If so, could you explain what&#39;s going on inside of me? Please, any thoughts might help. I also have to distract myself as much as possible from these rumimating thoughts that give me pain all the time.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I must have mentioned, as this is a very important information, that I am a person going through antipsychotic withdrawal damage(adverse reaction in my case), and the anxiety is the part of it. I see so many changing symptoms within a month, weeks, or even hours, and this particular problem had happened while I was having anxiety. Before I once took NAC in a larger doses, but that time there was no change at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that?
I&#39;ve been using 5htp for a while, and I was only helped by it, if not no effects has happened.
Same with ashwaganda, although I didn&#39;t find much help from it often. But sometimes it seemed to help me get rid of anxiety a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5htp used regularly is pretty bad for the heart, and if you don&#39;t cycle ashwagandha it might cause anhedonia which I&#39;ve personally experienced. You could look into low dose lithium orotate if you&#39;re coming off antipsychotics, it&#39;s a better alternative with much less side effects</p>

<p>Lithium is banned in my country, so I couldn&#39;t get it. By any chance, did you have antipsychotic side effects, and came off from it? If you did, please share your experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have mentioned shortly above, I am going through a withdrawal symptoms from antipsychoic and antidepressant pills. I took few doses in last september, and almost instantly, I started having weird symptoms. Than gradually I had more, stronger, to the point every function of mine were diminished, damaged, altered. I was literally a vegetable.
I was slowly recovering until few weeks ago, but then I started having insomnia with anxiety, which grew larger up to the point I became very sick mentally and physically.
The time I took these supplements was when I felt unbearable about my symptoms, mainly anxiety. But compared to now, I had so much to me. I was also able to function in various ways, and I was rediscovering myself in many ways. Now I&#39;m absolutely doomed, and I can&#39;t see no hope these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NAC takes the edges off. Highs are not so high and lows are not so low, which is why it&#39;s a great supplement to use if you tend to ruminate for one reason or another, I call it the stoic supplement. </p>

<p>The 5htp is a serotonin booster, this will lower your dopamine and you will feel less drive to do things, if anything you will be more prone to instant gratification. Add that activities which may increase prolactin to further decrease your dopamine, and there you go, feeling like crap.</p>

<p>Ashwagandha is good but use it briefly when you feel your cortisol is too high in a given period of days or weeks, think of accumulated stress, physical and mental as well. </p>

<p>If you have anxiety, I recommend you get Magnesium Glycinate (see Naturelo brand the green bottle form iherb) and take 1 in mid day and 1 in the evening, after you finish that get any other Mg  Glycinate supplement you want and sup with it on need, few times per week. Also get some Taurine and use between 1 and 4 grams as needed, when needed. </p>

<p>Sometimes anxiety is fueled by anxiety itself, and the mental aspect of rejecting it/not wanting it. However anxiety if you were to personify it, it is a part of you that needs to be acknowledged for its presence and perhaps its purpose understood. What did it for me besides these sups, was something Ekhart Tolle said about anxiety, when it comes, accept that it is there, stay with it, embrace it and welcome it. Show it love and watch it dissolve. It was one of the most ridiculous exercises I did few years ago and I say ridiculous because it worked for me, never have I had it again. But then again, I also keep supplementing with Mg often and made routines for ending my day in peace and waking up slowly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was like being in a black hole, quite literally. There was a certain heaviness, and all I&#39;ve been having inside my head was absorbed into it.
That took few hours, and when finished, poof, nothing left anymore. But now I understand this feeling is more like being sucked out all the time. Like being sucked by dementors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a few people on reddit who have had this anhedonia last for months or indefinitely.Â Â </p>

<p>I had a conversation last year with someone who was strongly anti NAC maybe I can put you in touch if it doesn&#39;t resolve after some more time, they knew a lot more about the negative effects.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to find a really talented specialist, supplements are really hard to work with in a situation like yours.Â  They all do eight things including effects on neuro, hormones and liver metabolism.Â Â </p>
