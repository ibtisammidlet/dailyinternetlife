If so was there any benefit? And  was there any as a nootropic not just supplement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Spirulina is giving you this effect, it means you have major inflammatory issue in the background being solved by NADH modulating properties, as well as &quot;antioxidant&quot; properties which actually is not that strong in it self, it works via different mechanisms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I feel the overall effect… generalizing I suppose they go hand in hand. And it is different than aspirin or ibuprofen that I sometimes take as  a harm reduction as well during and after an adderall all nighter with maybe some drinking or more harsh than just studying behaviors.
It makes a major difference peripherally and not cognitively but head discomfort etc. 
tbh I really try not to do it without spirulina number one amongst a bunch of others pqq, coq10, cucurmin and on. The real difference maker is spirulina.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spirulina is not that great of an antioxidant for what you are saying you are using it for. Spirulina works mostly via modulating immune system, which then modulates metabolism (immune system is responsible for system wide cellular metabolism). That&#39;s probably where you are seeing those benefits.</p>

<p>Also those other compounds you mentioned doesn&#39;t really do much for harm reduction for amphetamine use.. if anything you want to use NAC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take nac as well. And there’s a bunch of dopaminergic neuroprotective research out there.</p>

<p>And I’m not going to research it but sleep deprivation and amphetamine use modulate metabolism quite a bit, the argument that the oxidative stress is mitigated via anti inflammatory or other mechanisms isn’t far fetched.</p>

<p>But I’m telling you it’s one of  few things that have made perceptible tangible differences for me. Take with that information what you will.</p>

<p>Edit: I encourage you to google things like “spirulina dopamine” “spirulina neuroprotection” etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most dopaminergic neuroprotectives also reduce euphoria and the high.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying your claim. what I am saying is, because the human body is complex and things like Spirulina works via dozens and dozens of mechanisms, it is very likely that this effect would not be reproducible for others unless they also have a similar issue as you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there’s no science to prove or disprove that anecdotally I can say it doesn’t. It’s extremely subtle. Perceptible really when you recreate the stress with out it, and realize you feel worse.
But there’s a bunch redditors who swear by it as a general health supplement which is what I meant to do just using the amphetamine sleep deprivation example as my personal acute stress model.
Long story short I recommend it. I take or have taken most mainstream antioxidants or anti inflammatories and way too many others.</p>

<p>Of all of them spirulina is the most impactful in acute stress for me. And’s I recommend it as a comparatively inexpensive and effective supplement. </p>

<p>Really though you should give this a skim I barely did and it covered most of what I’d wanted to reference.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8224803/">Spirulina Microalgae and Brain Health: A Scoping Review of Experimental and Clinical Evidence</a></p>

<p>“Spirulina maxima extract was also shown to ameliorate scopolamine-induced dementia in mice, demonstrated in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. The effect was associated with the increased phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and p-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) as well as the increase in BDNF [53]. Neuroprotective activity by spirulina in neurodegeneration has also been shown in other in vivo models and has been suggested to be mediated by an antioxidant activity associated with the increase of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase [54].”</p>

<p>That quote just has all the cognitive buzzwords but there’s really references to multiple models. And I didn’t but I believe if you keep going there are clinical examples as well.</p>

<p>It’s really just an interesting wormhole at worst.</p>
