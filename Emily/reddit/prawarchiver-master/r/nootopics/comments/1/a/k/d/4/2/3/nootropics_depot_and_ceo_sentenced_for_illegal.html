    <div class="md"><p>Well they convinced a bunch of redditors to only buy ND even for the most noob/weak supplements. People don&#39;t need to buy l-theanine ND, just buy a generic brand that is like half the price per pill and they&#39;re still going to get like 90% of the efficacy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s stupid but yeah something you want to emulate. There are no other choices. Only us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has far more to do with all of the independent testing done by journalists uncovering, time and time again, how the vast majority of supplement companies cut corners and, at best, do not have the total dosages that they claim, and at worse have little of what you think you’re buying or even none at all. </p>

<p>I have been in the nootropics community for over a decade and have worked within the industry, and the problem is far worse than most people understand.</p>

<p>So yes, I pay at times more with ND for the benefit of knowing the purity and proper dosages is actually what I’m buying. </p>

<p>With random brands on Amazon, there is A: no guarantee it’s even what they claim it is, and B: you always have to check the dosages on the bottle. The price per pill Amazon displays is notoriously inaccurate a lot of the time. </p>

<p>For example, a product may say $0.17 per pill, and ND maybe $0.30 per pill. Then, you see the dosage on the label is 500mg with a serving size of two pills. But ND may have 500mg per pill. So ND would be cheaper by $0.04, and you have the peace of mind that the quality is there.</p>

<p>Look, I have no affiliation with ND. One of my clients is a competitor for one of their Natrium-brand products. Yet, I still buy ND for everything else because I’ve seen behind the scenes that very few companies are doing things correctly in this industry. </p>

<p>I know this because the companies I’ve worked with have done third-party testing for some of those top brands on Amazon you likely are buying from. They almost all have failed and are under-dosed. ND came back to spec every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it depends on the kind of thing you&#39;re getting. If you&#39;re getting something like alcar or any amino acid ( like most vanilla stuff that aren&#39;t herbs) then rando amazon brands are good enough for me. Even if they had half the efficacy, i&#39;d still be saving at 50% to cancel it out. I started with ND but realized amazon brands are cheaper and work/feel the same. </p>

<p>I would use bangyourbuck.com for amazon and make sure you check the serving sizes and doses to figure out what&#39;s the cheapest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reviews can be anecdotes from people other than actual sites, like reddit or forums. Some brands also do boast third party testing. You could also look up the supplement name and brand/sources to find threads of people recommending each other what works for them. </p>

<p>If you want to be super safe, yes you can buy from your favorite brand, but it might not be a bad idea to try out other brands that are a lot cheaper that you may notice still work just as well. Good luck</p>

As for the afinil series of nootropics I wouldn&#39;t even bother with that garbage I never liked any of them but I also am a newly sober methamphetamine addicts so my standards are a little high for stimulants. You might have more luck I don&#39;t know but they&#39;re pretty expensive so it&#39;s been if you but that s***&#39;s actually worth it.</p>

<p>That’s probably what really got them. They were importing the products for research purposes and selling them for consumption and making medical claims about them. This is why all the RC vendors plaster not for human consumption everywhere and get away with it. ND was actually trying to be responsible and even had warnings about the addictive products and that’s what bit them in the ass. </p>

<p>FDA just decided to make an example out of one of the bigger players in the game to scare others off. And it’s working LiftMode pulled their phenibut so now anyone buying those things has to go through shady outlets. Typical FDA/DEA making drugs continually more dangerous and risky in the name of public safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Tianeptine is nasty too I’ve used both and found Tia to be way more addicting. Probably because I got bad rebound effects from a single dose of Phenibut so I never wanted to use it a lot. At least with Phenibut vendors like ND and LM were putting warnings on the bottles saying it’s addictive and not to take more than certain amounts per week or day. Tianeptine is just being sold everywhere with no information at all.  People are gonna use drugs the FDA/DEA needs to accept that and work to make them as safe as possible, educate people about the risks, and keep the supply chain unadulterated. Never gonna happen though the war on drugs makes too much money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current system treats meth and heroin users the same way as violent criminals and bundles them together. These people need treatment and rehabilitation, not to be thrown in with killers and rapists. Our prison networks are traded on the stock exchange so there is no financial motive to actually help drug addicts but there is monetary gain to be had by locking them up and keeping inmate counts high. Drug addiction is an illness that needs to be treated by doctors and specialists not by badged thugs with a God complex.</p>

<p>Benzo and barbiturate users have died in US prisons from withdrawal, our system is in no way equipped to help with addiction. It should be considered cruel and unusual punishment to force a human to go through unsupervised withdrawal from dangerous and addictive drugs especially when the majority have never hurt another person and are completely none violent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my take on this is it&#39;s covid. You could buy all the racetams up until the vax came out. Numerous studies show piracetam for example has a clear therapeutic affect on post covid. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neuroprotective agents such as Citicoline, Piracetam and Memantine were prescribed to the patients with evident cortical atrophy. After 3 months, positive results of the neuropsychological examination were reported in both groups. (4) Conclusions: Although there are limited data on the benefit of prescribing pro-cognitive agents in the post-COVID period, our clinical experience suggests that it might be useful in the recovery process from the infection’s consequences on cognition for patients with brain pathology. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10453167/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10453167/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aniracetam exerts effects on CNS to dampen anxiety... post covid causes anxiety and cns issues.</p>

<p>Sulbithiamine(sp?) has also gone, emoxypine gone, noopept gone, all 3 of those have research suggesting post covid therapeutic value also.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like they want you to suffer and/or get a 20th booster shot instead of treating your problems yourself.</p>

<p>I think where they really done goofed was, at one point, they sold the substances in question in pre-dosed capsules - if I remember correctly. this is like, vintage ND lore, lol, so I could be mistaken. there&#39;s a reason the &quot;not for human consumption&quot; thing is basically a meme. plus selling it alongside other &quot;above board&quot; supplements very explicitly intended for consumption, and it&#39;s like... yeah, you&#39;re not fooling anyone.</p>

<p>granted, <em>none</em> of these sellers are fooling anyone, it&#39;s all bullshit at the end of the day anyway, but given all this plus the success of ND, I can see why the feds chose them as the one &quot;to make an example out of&quot;.</p>

<p>Each state has a different process for banning a drug, often it’s done by state lawmakers though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I even found this website was because I was looking for tianeptine because I used to have it but they banned it 4 months ago in Florida. I decided it wasn&#39;t worth it and that there was better stuff to try out tool wise. </p>

<p>I think Tianeptine sodium for me is really good at adding social smoothness and confidence while phenibut kind of does the same thing but it&#39;s not something that can work everyday and you have to dose 6 hours in advance on an empty stomach too so pretty much only in the morning.</p>

<p>Also I never really get high or really feel pleasurable for any substances or drugs I take. I could take a bunch of phenibut or tianeptine and it doesn&#39;t make me really feel good I just feel different. So I guess that means I don&#39;t have an addictive personality and am not prone to addiction when it comes to anything i put into my body</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenibut is okay the comedown from it is just too gnarly for me. Every time I did it, I’d have 2 good days and then 2-3 rebound days of feeling mentally like shit, anxious, depressed, negative thoughts, etc. </p>

<p>And re: not being prone to addiction: Nah it just means that the drugs you’ve tried aren’t your favorite lol. Phenibut and tia are basically poor man’s versions of harder drugs. I just wouldn’t take that attitude and try some real shit and get addicted haha, I’ve had a bunch of friends who said that and ended up junkies. You might not have a predisposition to be addicted (like genetically) but you can very certainly become addicted to the right drug. I have a friend who never liked opiates and used to say this a lot and then he got into drinking and speed and such and it ate him up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it’s a real thing. but the term “addictive personality” is outdated. the actual science behind addiction is complex and it involves the entire symphony of neurotransmitters and different brain functions working together (which also can be thought of as being the building blocks of someone’s personality), but ultimately the function of these various biochemical interactions is built by genes. but there’s plenty of other things that help set the stage, namely environment/circumstance/relationships to self and other people to name a few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly neither of these drugs are very enjoyable unless you are addicted to them and then you’re going to be mostly getting a dopamine rush from feeding the addiction and something that <em>feels like</em> pleasure because taking the drug reverses the withdrawal symptoms. as i heard from many people in my youth, “all the good drugs are already illegal/controlled.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are definitely addict but aren’t that bad if you use them correctly. Tianeptine clinical dose is only like 12.5mg and phenibut just needs to be used sparingly. Ive used it for social anxiety rarely for the past 5 years and I have not been addicted ever. I would’ve liked to have some tianeptine around for my depressive episodes because it’s a remarkably short acting antidepressant, but feigns had to feign. The problem is fucking morons, who as soon as they take something that makes them feel good, decide to take it all the time. It’s not like heroin or crack that gives me crazy euphoria. I’ve taken high doses of phenibut but granted I’ve never done high doses of tianeptine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes it’s an antidepressant but no one cared about that. it’s because tianeptine has opioid agonist properties so people would take huge doses of it to scratch their opioid addictions. it’s a dirty/cheap way of satisfying that urge and i remember reading multiple reports of people regularly ordering cases of bottles of this from ND where they would literally sit and wait stalking their mailman for tianeptine deliveries so they could feed their out-of-control addictions. they would obsess over how many days it took from ordering to delivery times.  if i had to guess (and this is only a guess), ND easily made the 2M and more from people like this. but yeah, it was a long time ago.</p>

<p>I had to taper for two months instead and it was a slow agony….extreme fatigue, dizzy, confused, struggled at work, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He got away with nothing basically. In the lawsuit documents, phenibut is also mentioned, along with some other supposedly toxic substances. ND sold so much of this phenibut, knowing it causes addiction, that there appeared a subreddit <a href="/r/quittingphenibut">/r/quittingphenibut</a> with thousands of people seeking help. And he will forfeit only the revenue from tianeptine (as stated in the plea agreement), nothing mentioned about the phenibut revenue! The prosecutors literally forgot half of the crime? And got only probation (2-3y iirc), no jail time. So that’s literally just like paying a tiny profit tax.</p>

<p>Also, how hard is it to change the product name in the accounting system from tianeptine to something else, so that investigators see lower revenue from it? It’s like a few clicks. So $2.4 mln from tianeptine is absolutely the lowest boundary of sales</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called manipulation of the psyche. Tell people this thing is legal and a cure for anxiety. Same way with the enticements made around foods, adverts, etc.</p>

<p>They sure did it with the covid vaccine. Is the the individuals fault for being fooled to taking something that would do more harm than good? Or is it Pfizer who knew all along?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you guys should be talking about is the fact that certain bad or risky things are even put in front of people in the first place, especially young people. </p>

<p>And they&#39;re put in front of people in such a way where it doesn&#39;t force them to think critically about how they approach it and consume it. I mean you don&#39;t want people thinking critically about your product if you&#39;re a business. You want to play with perception and make people think it&#39;s already normal and cool/right to buy this or do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenibut IS legal and is a cure for anxiety, it just also is super addictive. Pretty sure it’s prescribed in Russia, but I might be thinking of tia. </p>

<p>They sell phenibut at a headshop near me, they also sell it at a bodybuilding shop by me in a workout stack.  It’s not a banned chemical yet. (But it likely will be) </p>

<p>I agree with you knowingly lying about a product is wrong and that should draw consequences, but if you made your way to nootropic depot and bought it but didn’t look up its addiction profile, risks, people’s experiences, interactions, etc. that’s also on you. As far as I know they weren’t advertising it as a magic cure with no addictive properties, were they? </p>

<p>And regarding McDonald’s and stuff, they never advertise that stuff as healthy, everyone knows it’s dogshit food but it’s cheap and people love it. You can’t save anyone from themselves if they refuse to make any effort to save themselves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, if the manufacturer was not there. Would you have gone to the extent of manufacturing it yourself just so you can get your next hit? Probably because it&#39;s easy to make. Phenibut isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I have done every drug from a to z. Meth, heroin, all routes of administration.. someone invented these highly addictive drugs, maybe not with the intention for people to get addicted to it, but drug dealers do actually sell this shit with hopes of a returning customer. Your fault for being a returning customer, but at the end of the day, your brain is being hijacked by the most powerful dopaminergic stimulant, the very same system designed for us to survive. That innate system has been hijacked.</p>
