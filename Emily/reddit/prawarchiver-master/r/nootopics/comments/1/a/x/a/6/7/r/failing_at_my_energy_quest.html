        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&#39;Energy quest&#39; is this thing I came up with where I wanted to find some sort of supplement to give me lots and lots of energy. 
Unfortunately it seems like homeostasis catches up to you. There have only been three instances where I have felt like I had a boundless amount of energy. </p>

<p>Two random instances where I took 100mg of pregnenlone in the evening (and I&#39;ve taken this at least two hundred times where it did not do much)</p>

<p>And for 24 hours the first time I took a tiny amount of methylene blue. Subsequent higher doses did nothing. </p>

<p>It seems like my energy quest is failing and my body is rejecting my efforts at every turn... shame... </p>

<p>Pregnenelone is dependent on how your body metabolizes it and that&#39;s a very complex thing, and Methylene blue overrides the energy complexes in the mitochondria. Clearly both are not reliable. </p>

<p>What should I try/do next you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I had really awesome results, and then stopped sleeping almost altogether, that stuff powers you for days.  I cycle it on and off.  Were u taking whole capsules?  I actually crack the capsules open and sprinkle a tiny bit.  3 months in I only get 2-4 hours and am constantly doing stuff.  Maybe try a lower dose and cycle it heavily day on day off.</p>

<p>Its a really awesome tool, for a moment i had the perfect work life balance while running it in my stack.  Always had the energy to work, go for some exercise and social  to boot, and even go back home and work on some side projects.  Compound is beastly.  I cycled it twice and took a long break from it.  About to jump back on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh true, i definitely noticed it was really strong i can see a sensitivity to it could be overwhelming.  I just checked my bottle, i was making a 10mg pill last anywhere from 5 to 8 days and i was zooming.
I think we were taking similar doses but i was eyeballing it, and i would occasionally take a whole pill.  </p>

<p>I should definitely get a milligram scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have. The crash is not as pronounced as with amphetamines, but it&#39;s there. Also I wouldn&#39;t want to rely on a hepatotoxic compound just to have energy (although the risks are exaggerated). A final point against pemoline is that it can be difficult to source at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you have mobility issues modify your diet to paleo preferably vegetarian. Going to the gym stimulates growth (physical and mental) and creates a perpetual cycle of self improvement. Combined with proper supplementation like coq10, creatine, fish oil and abundant clean calories the changes will be gradual but observable. Also, check out rhodiola crenulata, an herbal MAOI that has helped me at my lowest. It will help you get started. When combined with a half a cup of coffee you’ll definitely be stimulated. (Be aware of potential interactions with MAOI and know they need to be cycled.)</p>
