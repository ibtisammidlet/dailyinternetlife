        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just googled “Acamprosate bdnf” (my obligatory first search to assess possible nootropic or cognitive benefit) and it’s got a little about Alzheimer’s and PD but nothing that would make it a putative nootropic. 
But I can definitely see it being beneficial for a million things.</p>

<p>“The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood;[16][17][18] however, it is believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors.[17][18]</p>

<p>Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context.[19] An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors.[19] The effects on the NMDA complex are dose-dependent; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal.[20]</p>

<p>The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine.[20]</p>

<p>Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors).[17][4] In alcohol use disorder, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA).[4] When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms;[4] since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). One of acamprosate&#39;s mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation.[17][18] It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle.[medical citation needed]</p>

<p>In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs).[21][22] Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death.[23] Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs.[24] Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge.[25] The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal[26] and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal.[27]</p>

<p>The substance also helps re-establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity.[20]”</p>

Not compitant man </p>

<p>My “ prescriber “ essentially wanted to half my klon dose from 1mg to 0.5mcg and hasn’t contacted me in seven months ( in uk ) </p>

<p>I knew not to do this and tapered slowly myself </p>

<p>I also sourced the acamprosate myself , found out about it from a smart redditer </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah nvm lol I just wish they would google long term benzo taper. It’s frustrating that I can go to any doctor and safely assume I know more about any med they talk about than them. And pretending like “oh I didn’t know as they try to explain how something works when they’re wrong and all they had to do was read the wiki, let alone the literally thousands of studies I’ve read and related research.</p>

<p>Seriously there need to be a law that you read the wiki pharmacology section before you prescribe anything not just recite what the pharma rep told you lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agmatine is honestly a godsend for anxiety or gabaergic related problems. 
I’m so deep in I get depersonalization derealization and believe the only reason I didn’t have a seizure was because I stayed in a dark room and took phenibut.</p>

<p>But something that might help is bso extract thymoquinone and I also find that a more full spectrum or just higher dose of regular black seed oil helpful for anxiety hangovers phenibut tapering etc. 
it potentiates the sedative effect of phenibut five fold for me. It might potentiate the acomprosate. But something to give a shot if you need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah using the nootropics depot
Ten percent bso 
Was using 2g Agmatine but hope to 3G since in acute . 
I rekon I’ll run the acamprosate for a few months post withdrawl , same with Agmatine . 
I also used lower dose acamprosate and Agmatine during taper so hopefully using these two will
Help prevent paws .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m 4mg klonopin a day for fourteen years.
And yeah I know i shouldn’t but over the years I’ve done a few one month cold turkey wds with doctors just literally quitting and not telling anyone, being cut off and the beginning of Covid. Then there have been the multiple day wds due to doctors not calling scripts or pharmacies not filling.
I have a good p doc and pharmacy now and always start taking three mg at the end of the month to just make sure I have something in case I have to be on the phone with the pharmacy etc.</p>

<p>At this point close to half my life I honestly don’t mind being on them. I do wish the pharmacies didn’t clamp down on the regulation because of the opioid epidemic though.
I will say I don’t plan on coming off. After this long from what I’ve read there’s not any light at the end of the taper tunnel even after a long professional taper. But that’s just me I’m glad you were able to get off. Xanax is a more dangerous wd with its strong action and short half life. My friend had seizures from it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some similar outcome of a cheap (common plant alkaloid) compound do something very similar, didn&#39;t save info about it tho</p>

<p>Gabab inhibition seems undesirable, phenibut (gabab agonist) has been the compound who fixed me up best. But didn&#39;t continue due to withdrawal horror stories (although I had none, despite high doses and impactful benefits)</p>

<p>Search tpso agonists tho, for gabaa</p>

<p>For me gabaa agonists often are dysphoric. Altough tpso agonist might have extra benefit by complex steroidal modulation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah phenibut is really a unique substance and is real mos I think is a lot more complicated than its gaba b agonism. There’s very little published research on it but it’s paradoxical in its dopaminergic activity. It not a very strong gaba b agonist compared to f phenibut or baclofen. </p>

<p>That said I’m not trying to deny how you react to different agonists or substance.</p>

<p>But I’ve taken stream I like it I had a little bit of abdominal discomfort which I believe my liver which was unfortunate. But allopregnanolone I believe is a gaba a Pam I think at the benzo site. </p>

<p>I haven’t really had any experience with anything that might work differently than that but I imagine it would have a modulatory effect on the gaba a receptor somehow through its interaction at the benzo site.</p>

<p>You could try absorbing it in your cheeks? Or other ROA&#39;s which reduce such discomforts. Cheeks is recommended for harmine adminstration 30 min prior to dmt nasal spray administration with 5mg increments (timed to your liking), I&#39;ve read 😉</p>

<p>Yea, among things. But a tpso agonist will induce allopregnanolone synthesis, thus logically not be as noisy due to regio aselectivity like exogenous direct supplementation. Is what I&#39;d think</p>

<p>It not a very strong gaba b agonist compared to f phenibut or baclofen. </p>

<p>Interesting</p>

<p>That said I’m not trying to deny how you react to different agonists or substance.</p>

<p>Its too complex. Ever heard of functional selectively? (eg) Apperently Clonidine has that at a2a-adregenic receptors, in a way that makes you forget aversive memory once you bring it up. Whilst endegenous known agonists can&#39;t. But I&#39;ve seen other mechanisms leading to similar outcome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sure I’ve come across it in some of my research but never given it more thought.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity">functional selectivity wiki</a></p>

<p>It’s really pretty interesting. Once you get to the examples section it really started to make sense to me in the 5ht2a example talking about different agonists and how different psychedelics activate different signaling pathways.</p>

<p>LSD for instance not activating ip3 signaling significantly. And psychedelics activating phospolipase a2 instead of Phospholipase C.</p>

<p>I am making assumptions here but but by not recruiting beta arrestin I think mitragynine or kratom opoid agonist alkaloids would have a functional selectivity.</p>

<p>Thank you for bringing that up.
I’m actually picking my script for clonidine I haven’t been taking it but I’m gonna look into that.</p>
