    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been the one giving out taper advice but due to recent events I&#39;ve had to pick up a tranq habbit again and it&#39;s fuckedm I need t to transition from flublam to diclaz and then wittling both down. I&#39;m currently taking 2-3mg flublam daily and it makes not a jot of difference, the reason I&#39;m staying on is through fear of seizing, my current daily dosage is about equivalent to 80mg Diaz or 8mg diclaz...</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna have a fun time.... But life does this to us, what&#39;s your current dosage of what poison? Also amazed you got a UK tapering plan on script.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Btw I&#39;m UK, I have more than enough pure powder to run off a taper but this will have been perhaps the 3rd time due to kindling I do not intend to.go down his route again and seek psychiatrist help.</p>

<p>In reguard to my tapering I&#39;m going to run somewhat, but not dangerously so quickened Aston taper. On problem i have always had with the Ashton is the the fact it is reduced in mgs from total dosage but more of a percentage of the total benzos consumed, that seemed like a more stable way to reduce without noticing but who am I to know.</p>

<p>In truth I am not sure what my daily intake of flublam, is it will range between 1.5mg and 3mg daily. I dose betweentwice or thrice daily daily. Fully aware I&#39;m going to have to create a dosage log for each day. There&#39;s maybe even an app to do it which could be simpler as in the past I&#39;ve been taking tally marks of my volumetric doses but when each of my solutions are different strengths it&#39;s tricky I could just equally the tally at the end of each day. I started this with minimal amounts of etiz and flublam 6 months ago but flublam is notorious for.smashong your Hypnotic receptors which is gonna be such a pain in the arse.</p>

<p>Suprise suprise I&#39;m also a comorbid alcoholic but I have managed to cut that down significantly recently which is helpful.</p>

<p>I expect this process to take no less than 4 months of tapering but getting to sleep is gonna be such a bastard as my circadian rytham is all over the place but I&#39;m gonna try and be strong and not get swallowed by the beast again. Im hoping that if I do this with conviction ill once again be able to whittle myself self down but I&#39;ve always Been an anxious person by nature which could come ABIT of a proper but as I said I&#39;m gonna seeing CBT or phychiatric assistance in the mean time.</p>

<p>Gotta agree seeing them folk getting up to 20mg of clam a day I thought there was no hope for those cunts, I have a little hope but I&#39;m on ABIT of a prescepice.</p>

<p>For the comments below.</p>

<p>Agmatine: I&#39;ve had poor reactions with that one previously so gonna avoid</p>

<p>Gabapentin: again I have found the feeling to be undesirable while using benzos so ill swerve that one</p>

<p>Fasoracetam! : I&#39;ve read that before and would love to get my hand on some more again ill need to do some more research on how it works with benzo taperong but I read positive reports of it a few </p>

<p>NAC another I have that I believe positive results with.</p>

<p>Ill Have to spend a lot more time researching while to keep a strict regime and ill need to keep a dosage count so I&#39;m aware of how much I&#39;ve consumed, including alcohol also.</p>

<p>My own idea fault but I challenge you to spend 2 months with my mother&#39;s and not reach for the tranquilizers.</p>

<p>Peace all and good advice all round</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditching the diclaz for diaz would be preferable but it&#39;s not really an option with cash flow current stocks, but I respect what your saying, also your correct in assuming that Diaz and diclaz are viewed as the same but stronger but I also disagree I find diclaz a cold benzos which may make it harder it the cutting but one of the benefits of making my own volumetric solutions is that I can continue to make them then weaker and/or take smaller amounts over time which is the best substitute ill be able to find.</p>

<p>I used the final of my flubromazepam in my last taper and it was sublime with it&#39;s amazing half life, no problems at all.</p>

<p>+Not advised+
But I have seen of people managing to taper of with a ezitolam with a very very strong regiment of dose schedules, the basic rules of tapering are slowly lower your dose and also slowly expand the time before redoing it works but its not pretty also take a knowledge of HL and strong self discipline, as all these RC benzos have very different sub unit targets so the transition will be abit cocky but I dont plan on reducing much of my maintaince dose while shifting to diclaz, this is gonna be a long one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so much on planning on running a daily microtaper yet but I do believe I can run on an accelerated Ashton using weekly to ten days gaps not every 2 weeks. My plan is to make my volumetrics weaker each time which as long as I kind of ignore the fact I know I&#39;ve done it I should be able to avoid serious harm aside from the sleep (on my god the sleeps gonna destroy me). If I slip a day or two on a bad one then ill try to not bear myself up too much, there&#39;s been alot going on
 in my life recently, self guilt for the odd occasion of getting needing sleep.</p>

<p>My current drinking has fallen alot over the last 3 months were previous it was about 30 units daily and now it&#39;s about ten units daily with maybe 2 days of not drinking in the week. It&#39;s not great but it&#39;s a massive improvement. The worst think is I don&#39;t really drink to get drunk I just don&#39;t because I do and I enjoy it. I&#39;d be a fool to say I&#39;m not mentally addicted and I&#39;m walking the tight rope between physical.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just gonna take time buddy.</p>

<p>Fasoracetam is something I&#39;m deffo going to look into as I&#39;ve read about it before, NAC perhaps also and box has been mentioned but I&#39;m not really in a position to import at the minute either.</p>

<p>Pain in the arse when my habits and interests have been how chemicals react with different elements of the human system for the last twenty years.</p>

<p>Ill Get through it but it&#39;s gonna be such a cunt, your right to remove alcohol but again that impacts sleep and seems to lead to more Benz.</p>

<p>I shall reconsult doctors but quite frankly to my knowledge there&#39;s very little benign drugs or sips that&#39;s effect sleep. Considering propanol. I&#39;d rather avoid AD medicine as I believe I can do this myself over time. Perhaps mirtazapine but that&#39;s a slippery slope and again the hypnotic factor isn&#39;t exactly long lived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As bad as it&#39;s gonna be I&#39;d suggest stretching that NHS supply for as long as possible just to maximum it, did they give you twos, fives or tens?</p>

<p>It would probably be worth returning to your doctor expressing concerns about the rapidness of your taper and see if there&#39;s anything else they maybe be able to give you to at least avoid seizures. I&#39;m unfamiliar with anti seizure med but glutamate storms are real, perhaps propanol for anxiety.</p>

<p>And as against harm prevention as it is consider getting more street benzos and make a volumetric solution to taper off. With street it&#39;s kinda impossible to know dosages but of you are to use wedinos to find out what exactly was in your street blues. The UK has been (compared to the wider world) pretty consistent with what&#39;s as described but don&#39;t be surprised to find out it was bromazolam in them perhaps even etizolam. I would suggest sending on to wedinos for testing and also going through there archive to see if what you bought correlates to Diaz. The trouble with street med is one pill can have five mg and the other 15.</p>

<p>If you have the capacity to get onto energy control they can tell you exactly but the most important part of tapering is lowering your dose and stretching the times between taking them. Of by some magic you get legit and stable diazepam make a volumetric solution and wean down from there. Obvs it depends how legit your supply was in the first place, others on the sub have mentioned galenika and other brands which typically aren&#39;t fraudulent but I do not know what you have access to.</p>

<p>Wish us both luck brother xx</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if I was gonna have a seizure it would have happened by now. I&#39;ve been off street stuff and on script now for nearly 3 weeks and nothing major has happened. If anything I&#39;d say I&#39;m more stable (likely more consistent dosages) even dropping to 6mg from 10mg street within 2 weeks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s mostly poor sleep,vivid/lucid dreams, little anxiety, little confusion and some headaches but nothing I&#39;m super concerned about. Chuck some RLS and tinnitus in there for good measure - forgot those 😂</p>

<p>Tbh I think a lot of my symptoms are in my head/health hypochondria too. I&#39;m still lifting heavy at the gym and working full time and when I&#39;m distracted, sometimes no symptoms 😅 </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have spares at the end of their taper cos I&#39;ve dropped faster than they told me to (probably dumb) they give me my weeks prescription every Tuesday, 2s and 5s. I&#39;ll have another appointment when I get down to 5mg and can discuss with them, but they have said this is a &#39;slow taper&#39; - UK Dr&#39;s are idiots.</p>

<p>I&#39;m defo not going back on the street stuff and I think finding out what was in them would just terrify me and potentially amplify the anxiety. If I hadn&#39;t been off for so long I&#39;d have probably done this (didn&#39;t know that was possible)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fear of seizing is kinda what&#39;s keeping me doing more a rapid taper and also the damn getting to sleep, my hygiene and sleep hygiene good benefit that alot but I&#39;m going though a Hella stuff at the minute.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had 3.5 seizures but non of those are directly benzos withdrawal seizures there been other chemical involved as well, scary shit man.</p>

<p>I have nothing to distract myself at the minute and I&#39;m in a fairly stressful situation ATM as it is so yeah the fear is real. I&#39;m about to start my transfer and tapering which is a good thing but even with tapering ill still be taking more bzds so yeah that&#39;s a worry.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not dumb if you feel your fine with it, don&#39;t take that as gospel but it&#39;s good your working out and have distractions I could go a few days without reaching for a crutch when I had thing to occupy my mind, we may be different but try to avoid... Stimulating activities as I believe that&#39;s where most my seizures came from with the excitement glutamate storms.</p>

<p>Tbh a slow taper is, I won&#39;t say well more than you diserve, but you&#39;ve lucked out to fuck there it implies they might give you more if you keep a dosage diary, a slow taper implies they might give you more if your honest(ISH) with them and they might see you down to zero and if you have surplus keep them for when your really feeling it as your tollerance will take longer to drop than your need for them.</p>

<p>Wedinos for all street drugs my man, especially pressies, crystals can&#39;t be told one for them next but if you look at wedinos archives and find something identical it can be really helpful in working out equivalencys ofnehats youve got has been missold.</p>

<p>God speed to you, but not too fast x</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I only used for 3 months so fingers crossed risk of seizure is low and genuinely do think it would&#39;ve happened by now with the switch over. I&#39;ve never really taken any other drugs other than PEDs and the occasional street Upper 😅</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got hundreds of street benzos in my house, I&#39;m not tempted or anything. I don&#39;t get like cravings for the drug etc. My problem is generally the opposite of wanting off ASAP. Just don&#39;t wanna mess up another CT attempt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very lucky they gave me a script. They&#39;re taking me right down to 1mg but it&#39;s 1mg per week drops. </p>

<p>Gonna look into wedinos just for curiosity!</p>

<p>They only show active constituents.</p>

<p>Energy control on the dark web will give you purities but you&#39;ve got to send it to Spain use the dark web and it 50 euros, wedinos is a free service which tells you what is right or wrong, no percentages but you should get results in 2 weeks, they hmcannbe a little finicky if you miss label but results are typically in with 2,/3 weeks. Test everything before you try it imo and also look through previous results to see if you get a ahaha moment that looks identical, what were you using from street, loose or striped and bars or pellet&#39;s?</p>

<p>Some brands are kinda the gold standard and don&#39;t get fakes, bars are fucking awful but it helps me help a friend find out she was getting sold pregabalin advertised as tramadol before they even released my results with ABIT of searching but when it comes to fakes you have no real idea of quality controll with ammounts in the pellets or caps or whatever.</p>

<p>What ever jpdol was it did not effect me like tramadol not pregabalin which I love, gave me proper nods which Ive never had, I was thinking it was a ziene....</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not your plan but if you were wanting to balance out the discrepancies take ten and make a volumetric solution that should give you the best adverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is another thread just couple days ago about success with Agmatine on benzo withdrawal. Scroll down.</p>

<p>Agmatine is NMDA antagonist natural mild form, so then similar ones natural like magnesium-threonate, zinc, lithium could be used since they at least dont do much harm and are not addictive on their own. </p>

<p>NAC is classic against addictions on regulating excess glutamate tsunamis after finishing of gabaergic drugs. </p>

<p>Taurine works on GABA system too, is cheap and lot of extra benefits. </p>

<p>Glycine enhances the activity of NAC and good sleep aid adminstrated before bedtime.</p>

<p>Theanine as glutamate partial agonist can also limit effect of glutamate storms. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Out of herbs, black seed oil, aswagandha, bacopa, gotu kola, passiflora work on GABA system. Reishi mushroom extract if I remember worked on benzo site of GABA system and may potentially give some mild alleviation.</p>

<p>Already on the mag threonate and zinc/b6 complex seemed to make me dizzy. Could be coincidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got NAC but heard both good and bad and not sure it&#39;s a good option whilst still tapering.</p>

<p>Will look into taurine, glycine and theanine as well as herbs but reluctant to add more than one thing at once so I can see what&#39;s actually beneficial and what isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So hard to know where to start and Dr&#39;s are useless 🫠</p>

<p>I do all those amino acids for the very reason that they are cheap, 2 of them are your bodys endogenous one in tea itself so safety profile good. They are all mild stuff, but cheap price and safety profile allows you to use them in big amounts when needed in combination synergy. Efficency comes out of that. </p>

<p>For best options if price dont matter then this NA-Selank which is costly and acutely mayby just subtle can be significant long term solution since it alters GABA epigenetics so impact is set to continue when it runs out, and it is used in Russian pharmacy for heavy drug withdrawal for that reason. Also good safety profile. </p>

<p>Emoxypine sensitifies GABA and GABA benzo site receptors whilst also upregulating dopamine what takes away apathy effect out of that and that is another of professional choice.</p>

<p>Fasoracetam (GABA-B upregulation without addiction into itself) and Nefiracetam (GABA increase in general + neuro-regeneration) are from racetam world choices, and Fasoracetam has become popular among Phenibut users to alleviate WD from that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propranolol (Inderal) has the ability to potentiate benzodiapines. </p>

<p>Its sometimes used concomitantly with benzodiazapines on a daily basis to avoid increasing their dose. It is also sometimes used when tapering down benzodiazapines and even when tapering off of them.</p>

<p>As far as I know. It&#39;s an OTC medication (Beta-blocker). </p>

<p>As instructed by my psychiatrist, I took 20mg in the morning (7AM) and another 20mg after 7 hours (2PM) to maintain a peak concentration of Propranolol for maximum efficacy. </p>

<p>He explained that a dose of 40mg is not within the therapeutic range to start acting a beta blocker, reduces the possibility of any side effects, and is what&#39;s required to properly potentiate Clonazepam (I was in the process of tapering it/lowering my daily dose).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is going to sound crazy and is hardly a good idea for the majority of people, but i kicked a decently bad xanax habit by switching to hard alcohol, then light beer temporarily, as alcohol hits the same receptors as benzos. i didnt have the choice to taper because i was getting them illegally and inconsistently. instead of cutting up my pills, i poured less and less, and weaned my way off. i would hold off as long as possible until my withdrawal symptoms were absolutely unbearable, and then consume the least amount of alcohol necessary that i could at least function and know i wasnt going to have a seizure. if you do it , you just have to remember that there is an amount of discomfort you have to go through. if you do this and go get a bottle and drink until you feel fine, you&#39;re just going to end up switching addictions and an alcoholic. good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are sometimes the only meds that help, i take it for anhedonia/blunting. Most meds just blunt me more (including stims, MAOI) but benzos help emotion for me.

Conventional medicine cannot treat this kind of subtype besides just benzos</p>

<p>And I take bromantane too but thats not enough, as well as sometimes R modafinil since its the only non blunting stim for me but builds tolerance. Other than that MIF-1 cycles, but they only partly last</p>

<p>The problem is that many things are blunting for me, normally stim/MAOI help anhedonia but for me they are blunting. I did try Ketamine and TMS, the former is inconsistent and randomly blunting while the latter did not really work.</p>

<p>Also tried Bromantane that has a slight effect at 2-3 sprays but its too minor to be a thing on its own, and I do monthly cycles of MIF-1 peptide which does help but has to be cycled and has some tolerance now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9mbc is different from other MAOi, it regenerates dopaminergic neurons, so it could bring the joy in life back. It&#39;s powerful. But you need to take it sublingual 25mgs. Bromantane I took orally, while I&#39;m on 9-mbc, I didn&#39;t like the effect much, because it made me a little manic. 
Tak-653 is bad, because it can cause neurotoxicity, because of excitotoxicity. It upregulated the Glutamate receptors. I would stay away from it. Give 9-mbc with nsi 189 a chance, but 9 MBC needs time to work take it at least for 2 weeks a month would be better and see how you feel. Don&#39;t go into the sun though on this stuff, because it causes photosensitivity. and if you take it sublingual route, you might lose the ability to taste &quot;sweet&quot;, but it&#39;s temporary though</p>
