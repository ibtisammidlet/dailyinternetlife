        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Core Cognitive Enhancers:
* Alpha-GPC (Momentous Alpha-GPC) - 300 mg: A high-quality source of choline, crucial for cognitive function, particularly in memory and attention.
* L-Tyrosine (Momentous Tyrosine) - 250 mg: Enhances neurotransmitter production (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) crucial for cognitive performance under stress and fatigue.
* Acetyl L-Carnitine (Momentous Acetyl L-Carnitine) - 500 mg: Supports mitochondrial energy production, enhancing cognitive function and reducing mental fatigue.
* Phenylethylamine (PEA) (FitPowders) - 500 mg: Acts as a neuromodulator, potentially improving mood and cognitive function by increasing the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.</p>

<p>Adaptogens and Stress Support:
* Rhodiola Rosea Extract (3% Rosavins, 1% Salidroside) - 200 mg: Supports mental stamina and resilience to stress, crucial for sustained cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Focus and Neuro-Enhancement:
* Bacopa Monnieri Extract (standardized to 20% Bacosides) - 300 mg: Supports memory function and cognitive processing, beneficial for long-term cognitive enhancement.
* Lion&#39;s Mane Mushroom - 500 mg: Promotes nerve growth factor (NGF) production for brain health and cognitive enhancement.</p>

<p>Additional Cognitive Support:
* Phosphatidylserine (20%) - 200 mg: Essential for cognitive function and memory, supporting brain cell membrane integrity.</p>

<p>Energy and Metabolism Support:
* Caffeine (from Green Tea Extract) - 100 mg (Optional): For those who want an immediate boost to alertness and energy. Can be adjusted or removed based on preference for a non-habit-forming blend.
* L-Theanine - 200 mg: If including caffeine, L-Theanine helps smooth out the energy boost, enhancing focus and minimizing jitteriness.</p>

<p>Absorption Enhancer:
* BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract, standardized to 95% Piperine) - 10 mg: Ensures efficient absorption and utilization of the blend&#39;s components.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised you have PEA. It had no tangible benefit by itself for me. Do you notice anything?</p>

<p>I briefly tried Sellegiline + PEA &gt;!(which please, I don&#39;t recommend as it&#39;s dangerous unless you know what your doing). !&lt;It had profound increase in sociability, energy and empathy - but no focus or goal-oriented &quot;drive&quot; like you&#39;d get with a psychostimulant (i.e. Adderall). It was very short lived though and needed constant redosing; and it was dangerous BP wise.</p>

<p>Also PEA is utterly vile in taste, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely fucking loved PEA with Selegiline. It almost killed me because as you stated, it&#39;s pretty dangerous for your heart. Hypertensive crisis can easily happen with a combination like that. It was like taking MDMA but I found it even more stimulating and that it enhanced sociability for me more than MDMA. It&#39;s an extremely amazing high, but no one should really be doing it, even if you do know what you&#39;re doing. Sure, tyramine intake isn&#39;t a risk, but the MAObi from selegiline mixed with any phenethylamine/stimulant and phenethylamine itself is extremely dangerous and there is very little you can do to avoid it causing problems outside of beta blockers, not taking too much, and doing your best to not move a ton. The high lasted an hour or 2 for me when mixed with selegiline.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sort of the same way when I take it by itself, only effect I feel from it is anxiety lol.  It also only lasts like 10-15min without an MAOi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting comparison in effects for both of us. I had a mere 30-45 minutes between doses (generous ones) before a swift come-down and needed redosing. I didn&#39;t find an impressive &#39;high&#39;. Nor found it addictive. Though the social empathy was superior to amphetamine I noticed. The genuine care for others more than my usual, felt so genuine and pure. I don&#39;t experience anxiety from amphetamine or PEA + Selegiline; it&#39;s crazily enough - a freaking <strong>anxiolytic</strong> for me.</p>

<p>I was more interested w/ the combo as a possible alternative solution rather than Adderall for my ADHD/TRD. I even tried Adderall + selegiline and it didn&#39;t enhance it (I have a stupid stimulant tolerance from years of taking daily; not due to any recreational abuse whatsoever). With my medication, I wanted what it made me capable of doing and being - mental clarity and the ability to actually get whatever organized/ball-rolling on tasks/projects. It gives me fulfillment that way in my life.</p>

<p>Yep, I felt my heartbeat in my skull; instantly knew this wasn&#39;t practical and dangerous. Really I think our dopamine genes and processing plays a massive role person-to-person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your stack wouldn&#39;t work with me. But, I like how dedicated you are in search of the optimal stack. I think the answer is out there and it takes a lot of research and experimentation to find one. It&#39;s quite a lot of investment too. I think that there&#39;s a lot of people who wouldn&#39;t understand. It also requires a degree of independence and freedom too.</p>

<p>I think huperzine a can improve your stack. There&#39;s something about acetyl choline. There&#39;s a lot to be gained from by optimizing this.</p>

<p>Also, for motivation and dopamine. Hiit exercises, coffee, and if you have adhd a very low dose of stimulant med with off days might work well. Coffee stimulates BDNF and acetylcholine release. It&#39;s good for learning.</p>

<p>I think a normal person can, under certain conditions, improve their capacity to extraordinary levels. Leo and longetivity is a really good example. That guy showed what is possible very well.</p>

<p>I believe Leo was able to transform himself through self experimentation . Its quite incredible.</p>

<p>How is PEA working out for you? </p>

<p>For me, that stuff tastes awful and makes my skin flush red. Also, it doesn&#39;t seem to have any nootropic utility. I think the companies are just trying to sell that stuff.</p>

Otherwise good job it looks like you do your research</p>
