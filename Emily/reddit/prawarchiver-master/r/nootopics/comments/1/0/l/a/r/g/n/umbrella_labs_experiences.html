        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello guys, about Iâ€™m ready to place my first order on some RCs/Nootropics. After much research and reading Iâ€™ve decided to go with umbrella labs. But before I pull the trigger I just wanted some more recent experiences from people who have used them and theyâ€™re products.</p>

<p>This stuff isnâ€™t cheap, and Iâ€™ve spent the last week researching venders, and every single one of them has a mix of good, bad, and STAW AWAY reviews. So Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™m not gonna find a bender without all of those, and umbrella seems to have the most minimal of the later two.</p>

<p>So really Iâ€™m just ready to pull the trigger, but I would just feel better if I had heard some people recent experiences in a new thread.</p>

<p>If it helps, Iâ€™m planning on ordering Pheynlpiracetam Hydrazide, 9-ME-BC, Bromantane, and Adrafinil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everychem.com is your best bet for Bromantane. Reliable, trustworthy source. Haven&#39;t tried Umbrella, so no idea on trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Alternative vendor for everything else that I&#39;m aware of is purerawz.co. I&#39;ve placed a few orders with them, pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for powder or capsules/tablets I&#39;d say they&#39;re not a bad option. That said, I suspect you&#39;re likely to find very mixed reviews about them as well.</p>

I found botany bio a few days ago that&#39;s still selling science bio goods - what to think of that?! Same label and has EVERYTHING. They seem legit but I&#39;m suspiciously surprised to see these goods being sold after thinking they with science bio were gone. Do you know anything about the site?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saw this thread. I use umbrella and have looked for hours through sites online. They are a little more with very few coupon codes. BUT, they are legit.  100 percent. They have correct testing from this parties on all correct batches. So no gambling or second guess. I recently ordered phenylpiracetam hydrazide and a peptide from them. The peptide came with a print out of the third party testing. First time I ordered the phenylpiracetam it came with a print out. I&#39;m sure they would have provided it the second time had I asked, but the product was excellent so I didn&#39;t bother. I will continue to order from them. Eat payment as well. First time I ordered about a year ago they were new and had some weird back transfer thing but.. anyways, good company, good products, above average shipping. This is the umbrellalabs.is I&#39;m talking about. In case there is a .com or some other copy cat site. Hope you had good luck whoever you went with.</p>

Also it is pretty obvious some pep/chem/noo companies have things they do better than others so really the smart thing would be the combined power &quot;of us&quot; to start sorting genuine results...amazon has an algorithm they us so it could be done but honestly a total pipe dream.
