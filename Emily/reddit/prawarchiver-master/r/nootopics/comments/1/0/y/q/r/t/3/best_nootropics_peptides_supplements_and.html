        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Waiting on getting tests done for MCAS (blood and bone marrow) to finally get confirmed why I have been chronically sick for 7 years, and MCAS finally makes all the insanely weird symptoms I have had for so many years make sense.  </p>

<p>I have been doing some research on different nootropics, supplements and medications that have mast cell stabilizing effect or have some other positive effects on mast cells. These are:</p>

<p>- High dose Vitamin D<br/>
- Cromolyn<br/>
- Amlexanox<br/>
- PEA ( Palmitoylethanolamide)<br/>
- Selank<br/>
- KPV<br/>
- Melatonin (I wonder if this is the case for the medication agomelatine as well)<br/>
- Thymosin Alpha 1 (Seems to help but not sure how)<br/>
- Quercetin<br/>
- DHT, DHT-derivates like Winstrol  </p>

<p>There are probably some other I can&#39;t remember and also the standard ones like anti-histamines.  </p>

<p>I am curious if there are other nootropics, peptides, supplements and medications that you guys would recommend that can help MCAS by stabilizing mast cells or help in some other way?  </p>

<p>I am currently taking IM Cerebrolysin 10ml for 10 days (on day 5) which seems to have lowered my neuroinflammation but at the same time triggered some mast cells, could that be because it increases NGF? <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24674674/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24674674/</a> If yes, what would the best way to deal with cerebrolysin?  </p>

<p>I am also taking IN bromantane which seems to help but it depends a lot on how my MCAS is. I also saw that bromantane affects NGF and I am wondering what impact bromantane could have MCAS? Could it be possible be better to quit both Cerebrolysin and bromantane and then start it again once I am on some mast cell stabilizers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I looked it over and have bought some of those things, very interesting site. One thing that confuses me is that for example curcumin is both in the &quot;avoid/bad&quot; and &quot;good/mast cell stabilizers&quot;. How am I suppossed to know if I should or should not use curcumin?  </p>

<p>It is a very good site for natural supplements but it doesn&#39;t go into nootropics, peptides or medications. So still not sure what I should take which kind of nootropics, peptides and medications.  </p>

<p>And I still don&#39;t know what I should do regarding IN bromantane and IM cerebrolysin because in your link it says.</p>

<p>&quot;Nerve growth factor (NGF) can activate of mast cells. R</p>

<p>NGF stimulates histamine release and sensitizes transient receptor potential V1 (TrpV1), which may cause histamine-induced itching&quot;  </p>

<p>And if I am understanding it correctly, both cerebrolysin and bromantane increases NGF but at the same time it does a lot of other possible positive things.  </p>

<p>Hoping you or someone else can give an answer to this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cerebro and Bromantane dont increase NGF very strongly, the main one to avoid wrt NGF is Lions Mane. Curcumin has both negative and positive effects wrt histamine so ymmv, only can see how it impacts you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so do you think it would be smart to continue with cerebrolysin and bromantane? Noticed a very clear reduction in neuroinflammation after 2 days with 10ml per day of Cerebrolysin.</p>

<p>Any other thing you recommend to try?</p>

<p>Amlexanox looks interesting but seems hard to find</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah for sure if its helping you, IN CBD is really great for neuroinflammation too: <a href="https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product/nasadol-biospectrum-cbd-nasal-spray-extra-strength-10ml/">https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product/nasadol-biospectrum-cbd-nasal-spray-extra-strength-10ml/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly old thread, but found in as I&#39;m waiting for a diagnosis of for my alopecia areata, which I think is histamine related and currently going down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I think it was triggered by Selank which is in your list, so I&#39;d procede with caution on that. There&#39;s a few anecdotal reports of Selank/Semax flaring autoimmune disorders, even if undiagnosed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been taking Lion&#39;s mane, and never knew there was a link between NGF and histamine. So I&#39;ll be stopping that straight away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a possible MCAS sufferer myself, (boy if only I&#39;d have known that word in the beginning) I find Theanine works for symptoms. Doctors tried to convince me it was asthma since I was 2 and a half, I&#39;m 47 now, the so-called asthma goes off when it wants to, inhailers, asthma medications, breathing treatments, zip. No defense. In and out of the emergency room with &#39;uncontrolled asthma&#39; pattern wise every 17 days for steroids today it is day 24 without an ER trip. I found theanine by accident and went to Nootropics Depot and got 200 mgs without the caffine, (found it in a C4 energy drink and tried to figure out why it worked). I take 3 in the morning at 8 am and 3 more if the symptoms return will try to go down if I can and plan on trying apigenin and even palmitoylethanolamide if necessary, as all the others never worked for me. KEEP searching PLEASE. For me this is an almost 20 year search. Medical Doctors are baffled and throw steroids at me, nutrotionists throw up their hands, so here&#39;s to hoping.</p>
