The only side effect of this drug class is nausea and emesis, But it&#39;s apparent with roflumilast at dose of 500 mcg, while the human studies on cognition used only 100 mcg and it was tolerable with no side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how, but it seemed to be a decent &quot;as needed&quot; mood lifter and anxiety reducer, which goes against what you&#39;d expect from an SRI. This effect has led some to speculate that there may be some degree of another type of serotonergic modulation going on as well.</p>

<p>Increased dreams are another effect (and I don&#39;t even dream/remember mine).</p>

<p>I personally didn&#39;t notice much in terms of pro-cognitive benefits, but it is advertised as such and it&#39;s important to note that there are many active ingredients in this plant and each extract is different (I used the standardized extract, Kanna).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also advertised as an aphrodisiac, which is nice because antidepressants have the opposite effect. I did notice more thoughts about sexy time while on it for sure.</p>

<p>So, there are two standardized extracts last I checked: Zembrin and TriStill. The former probably has more research and the latter, from what I&#39;d seen in the past, had more positive anecdotes reporting success when using as an antidepressant.</p>

<p>An unfortunate side effect I noticed was gastrointestinal upset and some diarrhea. This diminished with continued use, but I still felt bloated.</p>

<p>I never got to try the TriStill because it&#39;s a bit expensive. I would like to see if I could replace my Zoloft with it one day though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first discovered rolipram in about 2011 and thought for sure it&#39;d only be a little while longer before such a promising and light on side effects drug would be used for all kinds of things. Twelve years later I&#39;m disappointed it&#39;s still nothing but a curiosity. Antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-alzheimers, memory enhancing, anti-psychotic, anti-alcoholic and even neuro-regeneration. It&#39;s a crime that we let such promising drugs wither on the vine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your PFC NE is low then Increased PDE4 should increase working memory, otherwise it will reduce it. It basically will potentiate the detrimental effect that excessive D1 , beta-1, alpha-1, M1 and NMDA activation has on the opening of HCN channels and inhibition of persistent firing of neurons in the PFC. Taking an inhibitor of PDE4 with an agonist of a2 receptors should circumvent this and be an interesting experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a monkey study, high dose rolipram impaired working memory in old monkeys, But didnt affect young ones maybe due to aging-mediated PKA signalling dysfunction</p>

<p>Roflumilast at 100 mcg dose didnt negatively affect working memory, But it enhanced immediate recall</p>

<p>Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition enhances the dopamine D1 receptor/PKA/DARPP-32 signaling cascade in frontal cortex, this could be worth further investigations for pathologies charactarised by dopaminergic hypofunction like ADHD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;during uncontrollable psychological stress (Figure 2(b)), high levels of catecholamine release engage α1-AR and large numbers of D1R to drive calcium-cAMP-PKA-K+ signaling, which rapidly decreases dlPFC neuronal firing and takes the dlPFC “off-line.” dlPFC network connectivity and function can return to normal if PDE4 enzymes catabolize cAMP and normalize intracellular signaling.&quot;</p>

<p>Increased dreams are another effect (and I don&#39;t even dream/remember mine).</p>

<p>I personally didn&#39;t notice much in terms of pro-cognitive benefits, but it is advertised as such and it&#39;s important to note that there are many active ingredients in this plant and each extract is different (I used the standardized extract, Kanna).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also advertised as an aphrodisiac, which is nice because antidepressants have the opposite effect. I did notice more thoughts about sexy time while on it for sure.</p>

<p>So, there are two standardized extracts last I checked: Zembrin and TriStill. The former probably has more research and the latter, from what I&#39;d seen in the past, had more positive anecdotes reporting success when using as an antidepressant.</p>

<p>An unfortunate side effect I noticed was gastrointestinal upset and some diarrhea. This diminished with continued use, but I still felt bloated.</p>

<p>I never got to try the TriStill because it&#39;s a bit expensive. I would like to see if I could replace my Zoloft with it one day though.</p>

<p>Supposedly Kanna has reverse tolerance, but that was not my experience. </p>

<p>Good luck 🤞</p>
