        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everybody!</p>

<p>I have a couple of questions about taking TAK-653 and PRL-8-53 together. I&#39;m a 24-year-old male college student. Today is my second day taking TAK-653 and PRL-8-53 on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee (80mg of caffeine). I take 2mg (0.5mL) of TAK-653 and 5mg (0.5mL) of PRL-8-53. </p>

<p>Yesterday, I did not feel any side effects besides having a horrible taste in my mouth when I first tried them. But that went away once I had something to eat. Throughout the day, I became quite productive at school and had a positive effect on my mood (I was feeling pretty happy and laughed a lot). I was even able to remain calm and de-escalate a situation I had with my girlfriend yesterday night. Not much drama occurred this time lol</p>

<p>However, today I&#39;ve noticed something else is happening. I remember reading a post in this community about having vivid dreams with TAK-653, and indeed, it is true! The thing is that I had more than one dream, and I kept waking up and falling back to sleep. I&#39;m certainly not a fan of that. Also, 1 hour after taking both solutions today, I started to feel numbness in my head and my hands for about 10 minutes. I touched my forehead and felt hot as if I had a fever.</p>

<p>The numbness and the &quot;fever&quot; have passed, and now I just feel my head pulsating a bit. I&#39;m unsure if it is because I did not eat anything until now. But on the other hand, I feel quite active and happy, just a little worried about what happened. My productivity has not been tested today, but hopefully, it is as good as yesterday.  So, I was wondering if any of these &quot;side effects&quot; have happened to any of you or if I should be aware of any others. And I would also like to know if I&#39;m taking this the right way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m taking them  daily since January 10th, for exam prep.</p>

<p>TAK-653 in the morning, PRL-8-53 in the evening before study session.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t experienced side effects you mentioned, but I do have one side effect from PRL.</p>

<p>Approx 2.5-3 hours after dosing (usually 8-10mg) my head start feeling heavy and it&#39;s very hard to continue studying, unless I re-dose.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I only try taking it in the evening for short study sessions. </p>

<p>Once I&#39;m done with the exam - I&#39;m definitely dropping PRL from my stack.</p>

<p>Very weird substance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m taking both at the same time in the morning, so it is perhaps the mixing together that is causing me to feel this way. I will try the exact dosage tomorrow morning to see if it happens again. If it does, I will probably switch to TAK-653 in the morning and PRL-8-53 in the evening. </p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps take PRL-8-53 with a choline supplement such as Alpha GPC? I believe PRL-8-53 utilizes similar cholinergic receptors pathways like racetam does which choline levels can be depleted throughout that process. Low choline settings can cause headaches or potentially severe headaches like cluster headaches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been using TAK-653 for approximately 25 days now.  I have greatly enjoyed the calming and clarifying mental effects of it.  However, in the past week I have experiencing numbness in my arms and feet at the end of the day while laying down.  I also experienced Vertigo last week for the first time.   Having said that,  I can’t be sure if it was the TAK-653.  My energy has changed since using it.  my exercise capacity has lowered.  I may stop taking this for awhile and then retry another 25 days..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m doing fine.  I stopped using the TAk-653 as I noticed a consistent downside.  The calming effect was offset by some intense anger/moodiness after using it consistently for a few months.  Even with a very low dosage, the mood shift remained.  I still have some left but haven’t used it for months.</p>
