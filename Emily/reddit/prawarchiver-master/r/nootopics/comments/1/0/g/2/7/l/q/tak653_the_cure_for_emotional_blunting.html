        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Edit: 22/01/23</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s been 4 days since my last dosage. Memory issues from black mould have returned. Will be interesting to try TAK again after clearing the mould and using Cerebrolysin/Cortexin.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m angry.</p>

<p>In fact, about 15 minutes ago I was filled with a rage I have not experienced in a long time, and boy does it feel human.</p>

<p><strong>Backstory:</strong></p>

<p>Experienced dissociative issues in the past ranging from DPDR to a schizoid-type (<em>unrelated to schizophrenia</em>) personality which I believed to had been made semi-permanent due to chronic ashwagandha use. Pretty much all of these issues cleared up after externalising trauma: catharsis; repenting, bioenergetic therapy, etc..</p>

<p>To simplify things, my body would block emotions as a safety mechanism, and ashwagandha jammed that mechanism shut until I started clearing out past trauma with the aid of friends &amp; certain psychoactive substances. One thing worth noting is that body tightness &amp; emotional stress go hand-in-hand and you can alleviate mental stress through physical means and vice versa.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve been mostly clear of these issues, at least to the extent in which I&#39;ve been able to function &amp; help others improve from similar scenarios. The point is I could pass as normal, with the exception of being a little eccentric.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>Over the past two years I&#39;d still get numbed out as stress continued to pile on. How I&#39;ve maintained myself is by smoking cannabis once a month and using that time to externalised trapped emotions and doing mobility work to loosen physical tightness. If I didn&#39;t maintain myself like this, I&#39;d become robot-like: think Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory but without the soy. Emotions would become repressed rather than expressed as they should.</p>

<p><strong>Experience with TAK-653:</strong></p>

<p>TAK arrived just before the new year (29th Dec). The first thing I noticed in the first week were that my sense of smell started to bring back memories, which is something that made me feel less disconnected from my environments. The second: an overwhelming sense of dread began to emanate that was on the border of becoming unbearable. I had no motivation to do anything, including the most basic things in my routine such as exercising and posting on social media.</p>

<p>After a week of living with this dread, I decided it was not worth continuing TAK and that the next day would be my final dosage. Funnily enough, after a low-energy yet much needed session at boxing, that same night I overcame what I perceived to be a huge blockade that stopped me progressing with continuing with coaching. The next day, I swear to you, the feeling of dread vanished overnight. I continued the TAK cycle to the last day (today), in which I experienced a bout of rage that has allowed me to conclude with two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I need to start meditating again</li>
<li>TAK didn&#39;t give me these feelings of anger or dread. It made me aware of them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Normally I wouldn&#39;t need to take myself to a room and punch some cushions. It would just linger within me until the next time I smoked a joint and be externalised through tears. This time I was able to experience the feeling of rage, taking it out appropriately in what I like to call &quot;controlled demolition&quot;, rather than having it linger subconsciously.</p>

<p>Now, while these are negative in nature, they&#39;re also part of the human experience. The repression of expression ultimately leads to a depression; schizoid-like state.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>TAK-653 seems to have repaired a mechanism that would have me repress a strong emotion rather than experience it in the moment. While I could still experience emotions thanks to externalising traumas, TAK seems to have greatly improved the sensitivity to feelings: something I was using cannabis for in order to clear things out. It&#39;s also worth noting that I have been laughing a lot more too recently - another feeling that had a tendency to get repressed.</p>

<p>Now while I can&#39;t say for certain whether these effects will continue now that I&#39;m coming off, but if so, TAK may have potential to help alleviate anyone who has experienced emotional blunting from substances such as SSRIs, ashwagandha or as a safety mechanism to stress.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>

<p>While this may seem as a wonder-drug based on my experience and that of others, there are a few safety precautions that should be considered.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using TAK may re-sensitise you negative emotions that may put you in a worse place than being numbed out</li>
<li>I have spoken to one user who is still experiencing dread, as well has racing heart-rate, poor sleep, etc.</li>
<li>TAK should probably be avoided if you feel you are stuck at a dead-end</li>
<li>Your environment is important.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>The things you&#39;re claiming here seem more on par with psychedelics than TAK, and you&#39;re the first user I&#39;ve seen claim emotional sensitizing or dread. It&#39;s also worth noting the clinical trials thus far didn&#39;t report any volatility in patients.</p>

<p>So I&#39;d agree with something you said earlier, about just becoming more in tune with the reality of your situation, since TAK is the strongest nootropic to date in terms of increasing intelligence and introspection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m pretty experienced with psychedelics but always found the externalisation of trapped emotion to improve sensitivity, rather than the trip itself. </p>

<p>What I’m bringing particular attention to is that I have been able to experience the emotions at their fullest. Usually I would feel it slightly and then it just holds back automatically, but since TAK these feelings have been as sharp as they’ve ever been.</p>

<p>Given my history, one could argue that my case is unique, given the amount of substances I’ve put in my body. However it would be interesting to see what would happen in someone of a similar case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this post. Sounds like you’re living through challenging times. I, too, suffered with anhedonia after using Ash, and it was awful. </p>

<p>I haven’t experienced anything like this with TAK (I just stopped after weeks for a break). I don’t know much about the involvement of AMPA receptors in emotions, but I’ll keep an eye on this in case others posts similar experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in a pretty good position. While running a business is always stressful, stress is part of the package of life. I have a lot of knowledge &amp; experience that can help change lives because I&#39;ve been at the very bottom and that was the biggest challenge. This is a little bonus which is nice. </p>

<p>My guess would be potential influence on dopamine.</p>
