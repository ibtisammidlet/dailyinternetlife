        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been meaning to ask this question as part of a more comprehensive stack review, but I figure the sooner I confirm the better.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been taking both Polygala tenuifolia 20:1 extract 100mg and Emoxypine Succinate 125-250mg 3x daily for chronic stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>With Emoxypine, I usually dose 250 morning / 125 afternoon / 125 early evening. Occasionally, I&#39;ll take another 125 mg during the day depending on stress/anxiety levels.</p>

<p>Started taking both around mid/late November of last year, so getting pretty close to 3 months of continuous use.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve experienced no desire to increase dosage of either substance and have actually done my best to limit Emoxypine. Likewise, I&#39;ve noticed no indication of tolerance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably being overly cautious, but one can never be too careful when it comes to anxiolytics.</p>

<p>Appreciate any advice / insight on whether and/or how these two substances should be cycled.</p>

<p>Update on 2/25/23:</p>

<p>Over the past week, I&#39;ve decreased daily emoxypine dosage to 125 mg 3x daily and cycled polygala out completely on weekdays. No specific adverse effects evident.</p>

<p>Instead, I&#39;ve been using 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF (aka eutropoflavin) 10mg once in the morning on weekdays. Both Polygala tenuifolia and 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF are TrkB agonists, and I&#39;ve decided to cycle these per the advice of another reddit post I use as a resource (link below).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emoxypine seems to mellow me out quite nicely without causing any sedation. I don&#39;t notice any acute effects after taking it; more something I notice if I don&#39;t take it or adjust the dosage.</p>

<p>I also find that I tend to be less anxious overall, and I don&#39;t get as easily frustrated and/or stressed out by things that would otherwise bother me. I definitely still get stressed and frustrated, depending on what&#39;s going on, of course, but ability to cope is a bit better.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, it also tames some of my more impulsive behaviors. I&#39;m better able to just &quot;be,&quot; without spiraling out. Again, not perfect but it seems to help.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I may be using less nicotine gum (mostly a psychological dependence) and I definitely seem to be more at ease in general.</p>
