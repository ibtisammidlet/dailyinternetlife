<p>From my understanding, so supposedly it&#39;s supposed to block nmda receptors but isn&#39;t that going to affect your long-term memory poorly? (Also anyone know the effects it gives compared with something like cerebrolysin the peptide..)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It seems like it has a pretty good safety profile, so are there anything to be cautious about when taking other nootropics or supplements while on TAK -653? ( just want to be cautious for my rat 😉)</p>

<p>Would very much love to hear your experience with this compound?</p>

<p>(Things like, how it affected you and how noticeable that was for you)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on it for a few months. It&#39;s a very solid nootropic. It&#39;s primary MOA of importance is that is the most selective AMPA PAM available. The original trials were done at 6mgs and the suggested dose on Everychem is 2mgs which I think is much more reasonable. Most people seem to like it at a range of 1.5mg, for slight cognitive enhancement and elevated mood, up to 3-4mgs where it is more likely to boost your IQ but can start to have a slight dissociative effect for some. I have been taking personally at about 1-2mgs per day and have had no side effects at all. My mind feels generally more active and energized but in a focused way. It also has a nice mood boost as well. I think the owner of everychem really nailed this one and I believe there are already others trying to synth it but at much higher prices. It also seems to have no negative interactions that I can tell although some people claim it pairs poorly with THC.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;ve done what I can do. I just have to face the reality that this is how it&#39;ll always be. At this point, I think I&#39;m better off focusing on mental health and pain management.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It my first time doing IN instead of injecting so I will likely go with cerebrolysin since I&#39;m familiar with it and I believe for cortexin I have to get something else to mix it with before pouring it in the nasal spray, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cortexin needs to be reconstituted but its super easy. You just pour bac water or saline directly into the amp and then pour that into the sprayer. One extra step that you don&#39;t have to do with cere basically. I just think cortexin is a generally more potent version of the same drug. It feels noticeably anxiolytic and is like a general system upgrade overall. Both are great so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much. I believe that cortexin is also cheaper if I&#39;m not mistaken also.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not antagonist, not even agonist. The creators call it AMPA receptor potentiator or positive allosteric modulator. It&#39;s stimulant like compound and potent antidepressant.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m thinking about making a fresh post for this but worried people who would know won’t see it. I’m thinking about taking dxm tonight  but used tak653 several days this week.  This stuff is not a re-uptake inhibitor at all it sounds like? Idk maybe there could be other issues we couldn’t know about. How much do we know about tak-653 , it’s mechanism of action, and possibly interactions ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not, though I&#39;m somewhat interested. I had been considering oral/sublingual dosing, but there&#39;s a lot of hysteria regarding anhedonia.</p>

<p>While that <em>may</em> be more of a concern with oral dosing vs. IM (?), it&#39;s troubling nonetheless. I&#39;m not currently too keen on inj, as I&#39;ve no reason to believe it&#39;ll actually help.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;ve done what I can do. I just have to face the reality that this is how it&#39;ll always be. At this point, I think I&#39;m better off focusing on mental health and pain management.</p>
