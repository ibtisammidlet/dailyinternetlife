        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The goal of this post is to provide a simple tutorial on how to set up intranasal cerebrolysin and/or Cortexin. It is not to argue about the safety or efficacy of said ROA although I will briefly address those at the end of this post. I am also going to assume if you&#39;re reading this that you&#39;ve already done your own research on both of these remarkable peptides.</p>

<p><strong>Step One: Buying Cerebrolysin/Cortexin</strong></p>

<p>*The preferred/trusted vendor for both of these compounds is Cosmic Nootropics. I believe they are headquartered in Eastern Europe but they have a warehouse in Georgia, so you won&#39;t be waiting months and months and worrying about customs shenanigans around your delivery. From the time you place the order with Cosmic until the time it is received is about 7-10 days in my experience.</p>

<p>*For Cerebrolysin the preferred amp size is 2ml. This is important because from the time you open the amp and put into the sprayer it should last no more than 2 weeks a most. If you buy the large amp sizes like 5ml/10ml then you may end up unnecessarily wasting some of what you bought.  A 10 pack of 2ml amps with shipping is about 60 dollars which will last your months when taken in this form.</p>

<p>* Cortexin comes in powdered form and the preferred amp size is the 5ml. You will need to reconstitute this which is very simple to do with bac water or saline. A 10 pack of 5ml amps costs around 50 dollars with shipping.</p>

<p>*a note about Nasal Sprayers. This has been the source of a lot of issues for people so it&#39;s worth mentioning. The consensus seems to be that the Xclear brand of nasal sprayer is best. It provides the most powerful stream at the very least. I would purchase 2-3 of them off amazon since they don&#39;t last indefinitely.</p>

<p><strong>Step Two: Prepping the Spray</strong></p>

<p>* To prep the Xclear nasal sprayer, you will need to pour out the contents that it comes with and then sterilize it with rubbing alcohol and let it dry. If you are really particular you can also spray some of the rubbing alcohol through the sprayer head to sterilize the inside of the line as well. Personally I don&#39;t do this on the first pass since I assume the newly opened sprayer is pretty sterile. However I will do this line cleaning technique after a couple of amp cycles to make sure that everything is clean. I also prefer to remove the label so you can see more clearly into the sprayer bottle. Most sprayers will last a few amp cycles if you take care of them. The Xclear is by no means a must-have but it is the consensus best sprayer by people who have done this for a while.</p>

<p>*To prep the Cere, you simply crack open the amp: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmxAL1ZN964&amp;ab_channel=RegisteredNurseRN">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmxAL1ZN964&amp;ab_channel=RegisteredNurseRN</a> making sure that all surfaces are sterilized and your hands are sterilized and clean. As stated, Cere is already in liquid form so you simply need to pour the contents into the sprayer and you&#39;re ready to roll.</p>

<p>*To prep the Cortexin you will need either bacteriostatic water or saline to reconstitute the 5ml amp. The sprayer prep is the same but the set up for Cortexin is just a bit more challenging. The amp has a protective metal seal and a rubber stopper in it. As it was intended for intramuscular injection you have two options here. You can use a syringe by loading the syringe with the bac water/saline and then injecting into amp, then redrawing the reconstituted solution back out and then injecting the full syringe into the sprayer. The other method which is what I personally do is to use a pair of needle nose pliers to tear off the metal seal and then simply pour saline/bac water into the amp. The powder will reconstitute without any mixing. A reminder that the amp itself is 5ml, so you will simply fill the amp with the saline/bac water; no need to measure it.</p>

<p><strong>Step Three: using the sprayer</strong></p>

<p>*This part may seem self evident but there is a subtle art to nasal spraying properly.  Here is an effective tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0PHVkdRHc&amp;ab_channel=FloNasalHealth">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0PHVkdRHc&amp;ab_channel=FloNasalHealth</a></p>

<p>*it is beneficial to make sure your nasal cavity is clear of mucous. You can use regular saline or even the traditional xclear spray to achieve this or even a neti pot if you prefer.</p>

<p>*Dosage wise, you should start by trying one spray each nostril and see how that goes. Some people hyper-dose both peptides and do up to 3-4 sprays each nostril throughout the day. As you would expect the effects are more pronounced the more you do. I personally use 2-3 sprays per day each nostril so 4-6 sprays total.</p>

<p>*I do not know the equivalent dose from intramuscular to Intranasal but most of the people I know who have done both simply say they hit &quot;differently&quot;. Most report that there is a slight increase in the acute intensity of effects doing it intranasal.</p>

<p>*I would recommend you follow the same dosing guidelines as you would if you doing this IM. So 5 days on/2 days off for a cycle of 30 days is a nice place to start. Since there are neurotrophic factors in the peptide it is probably best to take breaks.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Storage/Misc</strong></p>

<p>*Once you open the amp you should keep the sprayer in your fridge. I personally put the sprayer, with the cap on it inside a plastic sandwich bag for extra protection. The solution should last about two weeks.</p>

<p>*You can store the unused amps in a typical cool, dry place. I personally keep mine in my basement so that they don&#39;t get degraded especially in the summer.</p>

<p>*Cortexin believe it or not is considered the more potent of the two substances. It has a more pronounced anxiolytic effect in particular. Both compounds will make you feel &quot;generally upgraded&quot; cognition-wise and I&#39;d call them two of the most relevant nootropic compounds available right now. I&#39;ve also heard those who have tried both ROAs say that IM feels more &quot;systemic&quot; and IN feels more &quot;acute&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Intranasal Cere/Cortexin over intramuscular:</strong></p>

<p>*Cost: A 60 dollar 10 pack/2ml of cerebrolysin, used IM, would last a person two weeks, which isn&#39;t even a full cycle. Conversely a single 2ml amp alone could last you up to two weeks of daily use at the same or greater effectiveness.  In other words, a single 10 pack of 2mls could last you many months and multiple cycles.</p>

<p>*Ease of use: given that most people aren&#39;t down with pinning themselves with needles(I&#39;m not) this method is far more simple and less aggressive for most people</p>

<p>*Effectiveness: this next point is certainly arguable however, as stated earlier, most people I know who have tried these compounds both ways prefer the IN method on the basis of efficacy alone. Of particular note is it&#39;s use for people with anhedonia and brain fog. An upgraded emotional system seems to be one of the key benefits. For me personally it completely obliterated afternoon brain fog as well and improved my sleep dramatically.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong></p>

<p>*this is a topic of hot debate and I&#39;m going to leave it up to you to do your own research on this. I personal know dozens of people who have been using these compounds safely via intranasal admin who have had zero side effects. In fact, it&#39;s far more likely for you to have sides from injecting them directly into a muscle due to irritation of the injection site.</p>

<p>*One of the common &quot;myths&quot; is that since Cere is derived from porcine cells that you can get Prions Disease from using it, which is a long term debilitating and potentially fatal illness that is caused by exposure to prions. First off, this disease takes up to 30 years to incubate and develop so any suggestion that they&#39;re related is completely theoretical and fanciful. However, the main issue that debunks the prions argument, for me indisputably, is that the molecular weight of a prion is too high by many factors to make it through the synthesizing process of cerebrolysin.</p>

<p>*another issue that should be noted is that since both compounds increase BDNF/GDNF that unrestrained use can paradoxically CAUSE brain fog taken at too high a dose. Even if this occurs it&#39;s temporary and the positive effects you usually emerge the following day after the brain fog.</p>

<p>*Increased emotionality can be uncomfortable for some people. Be mindful of this if you notice you are suddenly prone to powerful emotions.</p>

<p>* Lastly, it has been suggested by some that via toll like receptors some of these types of substances when taken either IN or IM can trigger an autoimmune response in rare cases. I don&#39;t know a single person who has had this response but it is theoretically possible. For this reason, it may be contraindicated for people with lymes, celiacs etc</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>*I have been using both these compounds for about 6 months and I have seen dramatic improvements to my overall cognition and sense of wellbeing. Cortexin in particular has completely eradicated any brain fog I might have been experiencing. My cognition feels smoother and generally upgraded. I have noticed both improved sleep and less need for sleep at the same time. While I had neither depression or anxiety prior to taking these peptides, whatever small situational depression or anxiety I did experience seems to be completely gone. I feel more regulated emotionally and my meditation practice has been improved. Many have called Cere/Cortexin &quot;vitamins for the brain&quot; and it&#39;s true that when you look at the ingredients list you can see why this would improve cognitive/emotional functioning on almost every level. Personally, I cycle these in and out week on, week off and have also hyperdosed them for short periods where I was doing 3-5 sprays each nostril per day and the effects were even more pronounced. Lastly, I&#39;d say these two peptides are in my top 5 substances I&#39;ve ever used for cognitive enhancement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cerebrolysine looses it&#39;s effects quite quickly. It really needs to be used as soon as you open up the vial. The peptides are very sensitive to degradation. </p>

<p>Cortexin is less sensitive but still looses it&#39;s effectiveness rather quickly. I&#39;ve tried both only IM, but the loss in potency was very noticeable. Open a 5mg vial ob cere, put it in a syringe and pin it 5 days later. You&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>You might not notice this with nasal application that much, as you aren&#39;t getting that much cere in your system anyway. But comparing a freshly opened vial applied im vs a previously opened vial is a big difference.</p>

<p>That being said, I will try what you&#39;re proposing here as I have both at hand. I&#39;ve never tried neither IN.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly how permeable the nasal cavity is, but it&#39;s somewhere around 500 - 1000 daltons, is not? A quick search on bdnf and other peptides says they are around 15000 daltons in size, which would make them completely useless for IN application.</p>

<p>I would love to be wrong about any of this though, as being able to use cere over a prolonged period of time would be a dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely different. Cortexin was very stimulating to the point it made me extremely anxious, so I still have two full boxes of it. Cere on the other hand is soothing, anxiolytic, and my head just works soo much clearer. It doesn&#39;t help me with sleep, it&#39;s hard sleeping longer then 5h on a 5ml shot but the IQ gains are just invaluable.</p>

<p>Or are there positive acute effects?  </p>

<p>I had a serious TBI from CO poisoning, I am prime candidate for any nootropic.  </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I found acetylcholine effects from Holy Basil comparable to Huperzine A, but better because of all the other positive effects of Holy Basil. I just ground up some Tulsi tea and tossed it down my throat, 5g ground tea, but have tried extracts/CO2 extract and they aren&#39;t better than plain tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re: Cortexin</p>

<p>&quot;[T]hen simply pour saline/bac water into the amp. The powder will reconstitute without any mixing. A reminder that the amp itself is 5ml, so you will simply fill the amp with the saline/bac water; no need to measure it.&quot;</p>

<p>This may be obvious, but do you just use good judgment on filling up the amp or is there a good &quot; stopping point?&quot;</p>

<p>Any particular saline you recommend? Would isopropyl alcohol (70% or 98%) work instead of rubbing alcohol for cleaning the sprayer? </p>

<p>Do you then just pour the reconstituted Cortexin into the sprayer? How tricky is that?</p>

<p>Apologies in advance for the noob questions 😅</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any saline is fine. Isopropyl is also fine. Really just anything that will sterilize the sprayer.  Pouring the amp into the sprayer is super easy. The whole process takes like 3 minutes. And yes, I just pour saline into the amp until the amp is full, light shake it a bit and then just pour it in. Once you have the stuff in front of you you&#39;ll see how straight forward it is.</p>

<p>Yes, for some it produces brain fog first, my mom for example (60). I don&#39;t get any brain fog, just clarity ...</p>
