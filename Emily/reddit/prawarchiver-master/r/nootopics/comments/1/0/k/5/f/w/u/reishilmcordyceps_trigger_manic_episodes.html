<p>An anecdote of Lion&#39;s Mane/ Reishi/ Cordyceps triggering manic episodes. Donepezil worsening my lows as well. </p>

<p>For phenotype reference: Just 10 days ago, I had a random laughing fit for about 5 minutes while staring at the ceiling. I was sober and quite literally doing nothing but forcing myself to fall asleep. I&#39;ve only taken notice to emotional fluctuation the past few months. Throughout my life I&#39;ve had stages where I come out my room to communicate and can&#39;t stop laughing when talking. I literally have to act like I just thought of something funny to play it off.</p>

<p>A few days after that I started using 2.5 mg of Donepezil a day and continued previous experimenting microdosing atomoxetine + dopaminergics. (In an attempt to improve focus) I then suffered from an intense bout of depression only 4 days in. It was one of the saddest, most anxious, things I&#39;ve ever experienced. It was almost like a panic attack yet depressive. I quit, obviously. Today, I took a Lions Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps supplement. The past 12 hours I&#39;ve been attempting to study, having extremely vivid narcissistic-like imaginations, and went on a pharmaceutical shopping spree. Within a few days I went from wondering if I should even exist to wondering how I get to be the soul inside an individual with so many gifts. I feel a comedown right now. My feats at 21 are impressive but I constantly compare myself to the best of my age during fits of low self-esteem which obliterates my ego. </p>

<p>I&#39;m undiagnosed anything. Completely sober while posting this aside from 400 mg of Piracetam earlier + said supplement.</p>

<p>How do I go about explaining any of this to a doctor without being put in a straight jacket?</p>

<p>Am I bipolar?</p>

<p>Apologies for using this sub to post my anecdote. I just value this sub because of the obvious number of competent individuals who participate.</p>

<p>On a side note: The mushroom combo acted extremely synergistically. Highly recommend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing refraining me from hypothesizing your experience as textbook Bipolar Disorder type II, is the sudden depression after taking dopaminergics/norepinephrinergics, which often (contrarily to your experience) trigger hypomania in BP-patients.</p>

<p>It’s very hard to say which compound caused what, as there are many variables in your situation, but I’m highly doubtful that any of the three adaptogenic mushroom-extracts caused the ‘switch’. Especially after having used actual pharmaceuticals designed to modulate neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Oh, and there’s no shame in discussing/diagnosing mental health problems with a healthcare professional. Although pricey, CT-scans and fMRI-scans can clarify a lot through neuro-imaging.</p>

<p>These might give you more insight in the pathology of Bipolar Disorder: <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-neurobiology-of-the-switch-process-in-bipolar-a-Salvadore-Quiroz/b5fb1bd28a26762c9802ee427b16a69597213fb3">1</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9TVfkb7s4i4">2</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.847584/full">3</a></p>
