        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>I just discovered that I have excess COMT and that I may benefit from addressing this in some way. I took a look at what&#39;s currently out there in terms of COMT inhibitors (COMT-I), and it seems like what&#39;s currently on the market does not cross the blood-brain barrier too well and, instead, primarily works peripherally.</p>

<p>Then I discovered CERC-406.</p>

<p>Currently, I can&#39;t find much information on this drug, but I do know that it is a COMT-I that targets the CNS. It&#39;s in development for use as an adjunct to levodopa for Parkinson&#39;s patients, but I could see other uses as well (I think someone mentioned they&#39;re looking into whether it could improve cognitive symptoms of depression, for example).</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m curious if anyone knows anything about this? What are your thoughts on it? Could it be custom synthesized to gain early access to it, like Tak-653?</p>

<p>Any and all thoughts welcome and appreciated</p>

<p>Oh! and btw, this is the main area in which there actually is some free info online about CERC-406: <a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/567/45567/original.pdf">https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/567/45567/original.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exciting, but the half life is also important to look at ; it&#39;s hardly viable if you have to take it 10 times a day like entacapone or 3 times a day like tolcapone.<br/>
Of concern also : the patent for it was bought 2 years ago, so after the paper you linked was published, and nothing so far indicates that research on CERC-406 will be pursued.  </p>

<p>Btw have you found a way to manage your fast COMT ? I&#39;m really interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I only function well if under controlled stress (that doesn&#39;t trigger my OCD or PTSD), for 1-2 days after exercising or after some prolonged cognitive activity... none of which I&#39;m able to maintain, and I have so many triggers to feel worse.Fast COMT is such a liability and that&#39;s so clear when looking at studies ; people with rs4680 have 2x less pleasure from similar life events, lessened executive functions, more risks for some conditions, they exercise much more than average to slow COMT. That&#39;s just depressing.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I want to check though : did you properly check that you have it ? Not only rs4680 matters, you also have to check <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/14/1/135/2355796">rs6269 and rs4633</a>. If the rs6269 is GG, you clearly have fast COMT, otherwise you&#39;re good.<br/>
Also, if it doesn&#39;t bother you, please provide your rs165599 and rs737865. I can explain why I&#39;m asking that later. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance ^^</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just checked my results over at SelfDecode:</p>

<p>RS4680: GG</p>

<p>RS6269: GG</p>

<p>RS4633: CC</p>

<p>They have some interesting suggestions for diet, lifestyle, and supplements. The main one I&#39;ve found to be helpful is exercise, but I&#39;m curious about SAM-E and St.John&#39;s Wort (SJW) as suggestions to help with this- especially because I have depression anyway and have been thinking about taking SJW as I wean off Zoloft.</p>

<p>I find it fascinating what you said about finding a sweet spot with stress and exercise such that you can help your fast COMT without triggering your PTSD. I&#39;ve been digging into my own traumatic past and what you&#39;re describing here sounds like my path to recovery. I go through these bouts of regular exercise and then it becomes unsustainable and I burn out. Or, I just get out of rhythm and then it&#39;s very difficult for me to get back into one again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doing a lot of work in and out of therapy around all of this and am actually going to begin ketamine treatment soon. I wonder if a good two-pronged approach would be to do something like ketamine, EMDR, and the like (to address the trauma) while also implementing regular low-intensity-steady-state cardio into the mix. This could even take the form of walking- especially if you have hills around like I do.</p>

<p>Feel free to keep in touch and share about your journey!</p>

<p>Oh, and here are the rest:</p>

<p>rs165599: AA</p>

<p>rs737865: GG</p>

<p>From what SelfDecode is saying, these are more favorable compared to my COMT results above.</p>
