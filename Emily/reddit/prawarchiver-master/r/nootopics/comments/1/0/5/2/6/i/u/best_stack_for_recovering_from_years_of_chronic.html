        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>7 years ago I started getting more and more sick (was very rarely ever sick before) and during this time I really pushed myself which just made me become worse and worse.   </p>

<p>After several years I found out I got several tickborn diseases and also SIBO, I was able to treat those and around almost 1.5 years years ago I started to feel much better. Since then I have slowly become better and better but I still have some symptoms mainly fatigue (especially mental), chronic irritated eyes and very sensitive to stress. These symptoms seems to be more connected to burn out (blood work shows a much lower level of inflammation than before but there is still some inflammation.) than some infection.   </p>

<p>I wonder what nootropics/stack you guess recommend for helping with the recovery of the years of being very sick and burned out?  </p>

<p>I started tianeptine two weeks ago which I am very happy with since it helps me with motivation, energy, anhedonia while making me feel more relaxed and helps me deal with stress much better.<br/>
I am also doing a lot of meditation, working out, changing my mindsets to become more relaxed and content but would like someone that can help with more energy while at the same being anxiolytic.  </p>

<p>I am waiting on getting bromantane and fasoracetam seems also interesting to possible try in the future.  </p>

<p>Anything else you guess recommend to try?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some of the nootropics I am most interested in after looking around that are for getting the brain to function as it should. My wishlist is not complete, and I&#39;m just making it for myself. You should examine all of these for yourself.<br/>
Cerebrolysin - 10-5ml IV for 3 weeks, expensive.<br/>
IDRA-21 - I&#39;m not sure about this one&#39;s safety compared to others on this list, but it&#39;s very interesting.<br/>
ISRIB A17 - Meant to make your brain&#39;s defense mechanisms that prevent neural growth after damage and stress not function. I think. You should research it. Expensive though.<br/>
Centrophenoxine - Apparently reduces lipofuscin? A combination of two nootropics that work together after being broken apart in the liver.<br/>
Lion&#39;s Mane - Out of the more natural extracts, this and baccoppa I have a sense are more for health.<br/>
Good nutrition, Omega-3, and exercise are indispensable.<br/>
PQQ</p>

<p>Another target you should focus on for brain health is good sleep. There are some nootropics o
to help, but this is a generally more risky zone.
Melatonin<br/>
Magnesium Glycinate<br/>
Glycine<br/>
Phenibut - use sparingly or not at all<br/>
GABA<br/>
Lemon Balm  </p>

<p>If you’re going to stress your brain:
NAC, Emoxypine, Jiaogulan, memantine, vitamin C, Vitamin E, Sulbutiamine, Pyritinol. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/24pz9z/amphetamine_is_there_a_consensus_on_it_being/ch9o5mn?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/24pz9z/amphetamine_is_there_a_consensus_on_it_being/ch9o5mn?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3</a>  </p>

<p>You can also take things for cerebral circulation. I&#39;m also interested in angiogenesis. Vinpocetine, Uncaria tomentosa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fasoracetam has done nothing to me. I would start with a more traditional racetam like Oxi, Phenyl, Prami, Ani, or Nefi.</p>

<p>The best advice I can give you as a non neurobiologist is to study these chemicals well, plus some others, and try all of them in theory crafted or anecdotally effective combinations with controlled measurements of your preformance. </p>

<p>Tbh you can also try DMT.</p>

<p>I took 10ml per day for 8 days of cerebrolysin almost two months ago and then two others like a month between. What scheduele do you recommend me to continue now with cerebrolysin?  </p>

<p>How can TAK-653 help? I was reading about it yesterday but seems like the talk here was mainly about it increasing IQ and cognition so was thinking that it probably wouldnt be something of a big help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just added L Cysteine this week. Unfortunately my experiences with glycine resulted in extreme anxiety, panic/fear, and insomnia (glutamate? inositol and B vitamins produce a similar effect- OCD symptoms worsen, can’t sleep). Sulfites and salicylates = urticaria. Trying to increase protein, I do tolerate that well, will continue on that path. Thank you</p>
