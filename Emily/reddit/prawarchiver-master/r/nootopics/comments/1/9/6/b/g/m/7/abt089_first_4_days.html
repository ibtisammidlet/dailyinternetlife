I know studies said you have to use it multiple days before it starts having a significant effect, thus I will make a report later again. But I feel like it might be starting to work.</p>

<p>The past time, at least the last year, I haven&#39;t been feeling myself cognitively and emotionally. Tbh, I also abused stimulants. Stimulants reduce acetylcholine and I also &#39;felt&#39; like I lacked that. So I thought I&#39;d give abt-089 a shot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to be thinking more sanely, less obsessed/narowily focused on small issues. I&#39;m starting to think more like before, healthy. Focussing better what is relevant and not in the big picture. Before I&#39;d be able to see that, but almost immediately forget it.</p>

<p>I know this might still be placebo, so be critical. Might report back later again</p>

<p>Its completely different I&#39;d argue. See my reply to another comment here, where I go in more detail</p>

<p>I&#39;d say racetams are more targeted at increasing working memory rather than field of focus</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its like, not more energetic or alert, so no increased attention (as far as I can notice)..</p>

<p>..But it seems to make a massive impact on focus, like my field of focus is broader and &#39;healthier&#39; making me think about more relevant information and thus increasing the chances that I act on what is best for me (in my eyes). </p>

<p>Before, during the last period where I&#39;d feel a bit impaired cognitively.. I&#39;d hold like only 1 interest in mind each new day. So I simply did my responsibilities when they popped up urgently, ignored the ones I could and spend the whole day solely on that 1 thing. Not being very helpful for getting a balanced life.</p>

<p>Now I have back a broad area of interest again, eg: thinking about working out, going somewhere, planning for school, fantasing about my future etc</p>

<p>Kinda like I got stuck in always having my adhd-hyperfocus but abt-089 rescued me (without decreasing my concentration)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes np. It is still anecdotal tho.</p>

<p>On the one hand I have a lot of experience, used a wide variety of substances and used some substances enough to tell a difference. If the impact is high enough I can accurately describe it. </p>

<p>On the other hand Im a bit insensitive to lots of compounds, including most nootropics. So contradictively the effects must be of high enough impact for me to be 100% sure, which I thus can&#39;t guarantee now (its not as impactful/noticable as taking stimulants eg)</p>

<p>Although theoretically it could make sense. And theoretically it likely does more good than harm.</p>

<p>Additionally subtlety is often prefered for practical use of nootropics, contradictably to it being undesirable for analysing its effects</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always follow the dosage given in the site (volume devided by the given &quot;estimated use&quot; parameter.</p>

<p>So that&#39;d be 1ml ABT-089=&gt; 4 mg</p>

<p>Also, I do use tropisetron. They do not clash but both affect the family of nicotonic receptors.. at 0,25mL=&gt; 5 mg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people use it to help them quit nicotine, indeed.
It&#39;s been two days now for me, I did not completely quit nicotine (I don&#39;t plan that for now) but I vape much less.</p>

<p>I have the same feeling that OP with this substance, it seems to help for focus and it seems to have a positive effect on mood. I don&#39;t think working memory is affected (for that, there are many things. Tak and Racetams for working memory, PRL for information retention)</p>

<p>The effects are quite subtle and what I say is just anecdotal but I think I can say it&#39;s definitely not a placebo and a very interesting substance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a little followup after more than 15 days. </p>

<p>My impressions have not changed much: less urge to vape (especially in the morning), an increase in focus during the day (but no tunnel vision at all), a bit less irritability than usually.</p>

<p>I also confirm that while the half life is short, its effects seem persistant during the whole day.</p>

<p>A good compound, which can seem mild at first glance but which have a real nootropic activity in the background.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although it&#39;s not the same mode of action, it&#39;s relatively comparable, in a way.
It&#39;s not as obviously noticeable but it lasts longer, it&#39;s a more diffuse effect.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have ADHD at all but I often have some trouble focussing. ABT helps, it&#39;s a very smooth focusing effect.</p>
