Is so frustrating dealing with sprays, particularly the bromantine spray, I just don&#39;t get it. </p>

<p>Today I sprayed it in 10 different ways and the only way that work that I discovered was laying my head on its side on a pillow and spraying on the top nostril. Boom, works.</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to inject bromantane but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s soluble in anything injectable so boo. And I know for a fact a lot of people in the community also suck at doing this. </p>

<p>The head on side method is something I&#39;ll be using for now on, all the other advice and methods I&#39;ve read suck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MCT or C8? I ask because I have read multiple places that C8 is necessary, and C8 is only part of what is in MCT.</p>

<p>I have tried multiple times with C8, to emulate a vendor&#39;s nasal spray product, and I cannot get even 15mg/ml to dissolve in C8 Caprylic Acid, not even with heating or 24h of magnetic stirring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NootropicSource was the source. I haven&#39;t had the Bromantane tested,but the vendor is frequently used by others. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t tried alternate oils myself, only tried pure C8 because that is what EveryChem allegedly uses to make a 90mg/ml nasal spray [that I was attempting to replicate].</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;ll have to try another oil base, but it likely won&#39;t work well as a nasal spray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use PGLchem for everything that EC and my usual Chinese vendors don&#39;t/can&#39;t supply. Got my Bromantane crystals there. I have no idea why your Bromantane doesn&#39;t dissolve in C8 while according to EC it should dissolve. It can either be the purity of your C8, the purity of your Bromantane or inaccurate information on the solubility on EC (quite unlikely I suppose).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God damn, how long does the effect last in comparison? I&#39;m trying to work out how to get some in my steroid blend without needing to buy a sterile carrier oil. Where&#39;d you get the MCT from, I assume it&#39;s in vials?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Effect lasts all day, the half-life of 11 hours in humans seems pretty accurate. I buy MCT oil at a lab supplier in my country, I always boil the resulting solution and sterilize through .20 micron filters. I always add 1% BA to solutions I am going to inject, mainly to keep it bacteriostatic in storage. Theoretically just sterilizing the solution through a filter would already be sufficient but I boil it beforehand just in case. Never had any issues doing it this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just did my first shot, sterilised a little cap thing and put my daily RIP blent (test/tren/mast) and let it dissolve, pinned 10mg with 0.7ml of my oil, is there a better way of doing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I suppose that&#39;s fine already. Quite the amount of oil imo but I guess that&#39;s needed to pin your blend. If purely Bromantane you should be able to achieve 100mg/mL in MCT oil easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes some people may have deviated septums (not uncommon), blockage due to allergies, mucus, etc. I can see how it could be highly variable and inconsistent. I try to clear my nose out with a saline aerosol spray and do some sinus humming to boost nitric oxide significantly before spraying (improved clearance and vasodilation). This is also great for sinus infections but that is a different topic.</p>
