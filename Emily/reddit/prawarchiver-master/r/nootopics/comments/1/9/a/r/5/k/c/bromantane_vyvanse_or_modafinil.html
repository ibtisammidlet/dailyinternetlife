        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>I just received bromantane spray from everychem. I&#39;m prescribed 50mg Vyvanse, which I usually take 3-5 times a week, and I often take modafinil 1-2 times a week on my off days if I have a lot I need to do. Is taking bromantane with either of these fine, or should I only use it on my days off? Ideally, if bromantane works well for me, I&#39;d like to get to the point where I&#39;d only take harsher stimulants as a kind of nuclear option for  when life gets hectic and I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed instead of using them to get through day-to-day life.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My thought is that theyre both dopaminergic and therefore will overexcite neurons, which can increase glutamate expression and lead to neuronal damage and even senescence.  Typically, i advise against the combination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinical amphetamines are typically fine if dosed appropriately especially in the case of elvanse. If you&#39;re using amphetamines as a nootropic as someone without ADHD then this advice is fair but if you have ADHD i&#39;d never suggest to anyone that they should stop using the drug. Elvanse has been a godsend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that’s just an analogue of vyvanse, so why would it interact differently? They’re both dopmanergic, vyvanse just hits 3 receptor locations while concerta(methylphenidate) is only antagonizing 1…. This seems like silly advice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Methylphenidate is a different class of drug from amphetamines. Less side effects, less potential to be neurotoxic (especially when mixed with other things that boost dopamine) and less likely to down regulate or desensitize dopamine receptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d agree.</p>

<p>DexMethylphenidate feels slightly cleaner than Methylphenidate, but usually they make you try methylphenidate first.</p>

<p>It definitely still caused a significant tolerance though, as well as bad crashes.</p>

<p>It hits a bit harder than Amphetamine IME and has a much sharper drop off….sometimes it feels instant.</p>

<p>Very short lived too…,I work second shift, dose very late and often fall asleep four or five hours later </p>

<p>Overall it sucks having to rely on ADHD meds, but methylphenidate does seem the safer option</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried Methylphenidate extended release version (Ritalin LA)? It’s been pretty smooth for me and I don’t feel the need to redose. I take a lot of noots though, so I don’t know if it would have been worse for me if I wasn’t taking Bromantane and other stuff. MPH ER feels way more like a regular nootropic than amph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting I never tried it….been on the IR.</p>

<p>I was worried about ER second dose kicking in at a bad time….like while I’m trying to eat lunch for example….did you ever have that problem?</p>

<p>I think there’s a psychological comfort with IR that I can choose when the next dose is…so I can plan around meals and most important tasks.</p>

<p>But IR is a rough roller coaster, ER does sound smoother.</p>

<p>When does the second dose kick in?  About 4 hours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s not much official research (despite being research chemicals lol)</p>

<p>In my non medical opinion, I can’t see anything too dangerous about them for occasional use, other than the typical side effects of DNRI’s….but there might be some unknown dangers….so I limit my use, especially since I get pharma grade methylphenidate prescribed.</p>

<p>There’s all kinds of information and anecdotal experiences on Erowid, Psychonaut Wiki, Blue Light, and r/researchchemicals. </p>

<p>Def do a lot of research first,</p>

<p>Also try to find clean vendors with good lab reports..,,contaminants, impurities, and heavy metals can be just as dangerous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take Bromantane 1 day then you have break several days and take it again, understand it won&#39;t do much and it won&#39;t work, this is not that type of mechanism. For Bromantane to work, it needs to be taken daily because it builds up its effects (it also works great if you drink coffee too) and expect to feel and form an opinion on Bromantane in a week of daily intake (i do 50-70mg sublingually morning 7 AM and has a 4 hour come up i think until it starts but also faster in time) and in about a week of daily use give or take, you can definitely notice it. I also read about this in numerous bromantane threads and experience it myself. Bit of piracetam and gingko biloba (gingko long term go) are nice, also alcar for who can tolerate it. but since you tak vyvanse which I am not familiar with, stick to what you know is best for you.</p>
