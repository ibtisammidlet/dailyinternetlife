        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi folks,</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make a premise, I&#39;m not a novice to nootropics and psychotropic drugs, NSI 189 is a molecule that I think has enormous potential if used correctly, and which I believe is underestimated for three reasons: </p>

<p>- the first is that in the second phase of the trials it did not prove to be more effective than placebo as an antidepressant, but by the study authors&#39; own admission, the depression measurement scale referred to obsolete guidelines.  </p>

<p>- second, the antidepressant effect could actually be the exact opposite if not used correctly, since as we know, it increases the emotional response, which can be an advantage in a phase in which depression is in a phase of apathy that lasts for a long time but a disadvantage if you are in a phase of strong anguish and/or sadness  </p>

<p>- third, the dose of 40mg per day I suspect, after months of anecdotes collected, and from personal experience, is really too much  </p>

<p>Starting from these three points, I&#39;ll tell you how my approach was. I started using nsi in September 2023, in freebase form, at a dose of 20mg die. I was depressed and apathetic. Within a week my emotions returned but I had great brain fog and severe anxiety, as well as an incredible headache, a mess. Furthermore, after about 10 days I became really too emotional and sad. So I reduced the NSI to 10mg die and to make a long story short:</p>

<p>the positive sides remained, the negative ones attenuated. </p>

<p>Not only that, I went from mental fog to excellent focus and great energy, improved memory but the anxiety remained. After about 2 months however the anxiety was becoming too strong and I stopped it. Do you know when you think you&#39;ve found something really good but you need to learn how to use it? </p>

<p>Well, I had this in mind and I would try again until I found a way to make it work. By experimenting with doses, times and methods of intake, I came to the conclusion that intranasal intake at 5mg is, at least for me, the perfect option. I think it has become my favorite nootropic, </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what effects I find:  </p>

<p>- childish sense of curiosity </p>

<p>- it gives you so much focus that it allows you to do boring things without getting demotivated </p>

<p>- high sociability and, STRANGELY, a sense of self-confidence and indifference to criticism, almost zen </p>

<p>- general optimism </p>

<p>- increase in memory at least in the short term </p>

<p>- sense of calm and peace with the world  </p>

<p>the only downside is that a very slight anxiety appears towards the evening but it is really very manageable. I&#39;d be curious to know if anyone else has experiences like this lately </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have yet to try it, but I’ve heard a common complaint while it intensifies good emotions it also intensifies the bad as well. So I think it would be more useful if used under the right conditions when you aren’t going through a rough patch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s true, it tends to amplify both. However, with a kind of &quot;microdosing&quot; and administered intranasally, I noticed that emotions in general have certainly increased, but I process them in a different way, for example:</p>

<p>if something hurts me, I can get over it and move forward with much more clarity than before. it&#39;s as if there was a general underlying optimism, which makes me manage everything better. I can assure you that I have felt negative emotions since I started 5mg IN, but I repeat, I process them in a more rational way, even if it may seem counterintuitive. Obviously these anecdotes have no scientific evidence worthy of note as NSI at such low doses and via the intratransal route has not been studied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experience with NSI is that it&#39;s a highly potent nootropic, mostly what OP describes. However, the emotional amplifier effect is a bit bothersome at the standard 40mg dose. Curiously both TAK-653 and IDRA-21 also amplify emotions for me. I have also found with neurogenics in general that they make me inattentive and worsen my ADHD for the duration they are taken. Dihexa is the most potent and turns my mild ADHD into extreme ADHD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for sure but I don&#39;t see why not. In reality, however, oral bioavailability is high and intranasal administration is not necessary or even studied, but I and others find that it works</p>
