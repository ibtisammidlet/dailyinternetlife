        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all, I am a 44 yr old female with Bipolar Type 2, Borderline Personality Disorder, Severe Anxiety, and Fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m also on a low dose of Suboxone. I&#39;ve been taking magnesium at night to counteract the constipation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching Sarcosine and NAC and I think they might benefit me. NAC for the mood lift and possible energy and mood stabilizer, and the NAC for my anxiety.</p>

<p>I just wanted to see what you guys thought about this, what dose should I start with, and do you have any advice on other supplements?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Amy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NAC could help for sure, I would be cautious with Sarcosine though as it can trigger mania. I would add Lithium Orotate and Sulforaphane (Avmacol or BROQ). Also make sure you are getting adequate Zn and Cu when using NAC as it chelates those minerals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does sarcosine induce mania? Does it carry significantly more risk or did it just happen once to some study patient?</p>

<p>Also, what even os this one for? Haha. Skipped over my head. I&#39;ve used &#39;similar&#39; nootropics (glycine, d-serine, neboglamine etc) those all seem to rather &#39;normalize&#39; me (not bipolar, but do have adhd)</p>

<p>Lithium Intried once, did nothing. Such a shame, interesting compound. But very dangerous</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What type of magnesium do you take? The form of salt you take has a big impact on how it distributes (some don&#39;t go to your brain much eg)</p>

<p>Maybe your doctor can prescribe memantine instead of magnesium, if it goes and is safe for your mood. As it works the same but better as to say</p>

<p>*Oke so, you:<br/>
Borderline.<br/>
Bipolar(2).<br/>
Anxiety (potentiated symptom of all).<br/>
Fibromyalgia<br/>
Constipation(symptom).   </p>

<p>Medicated with:<br/>
Suboxone.<br/>
Magnesium(for constipation).   </p>

<p>Want to try:<br/>
NAC (mood lift/stabalizer)*</p>

<p>Wants advice.*</p>

<p>What does suboxone help you with if I may ask?</p>

<p>I knew someone with Fibromyalgia, that shit is heavy. For that perhaps?</p>

<p>I remember that Fibromyalgia is often fundamentally liked with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). Basically an overactive immune system via histamine. </p>

<p>Fibromyalgia:
Regarding pain:
-Yuanhu-Baizhi
herb pair (34/44 of its targeted genes reduce subjective pain) (I can send study)
-Agmatine
-Maca/paracetamol/CBD</p>

<p>Against inflamation (Firbro often comborid with it (MCAS))
-NAC, Palmitoylethanolamide(PEA), antihistamines (antidepressent/mood stabaliser that antagonises Histamine receptors?(H1R))</p>

<p>For borderline:<br/>
D-Serine or Nebaglomine can add D-glycine.    </p>

<p>Now i got tired.. Ill continue if valuable</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you so much for your response!</p>

<p>I take suboxone for opiate addiction. I was never into the Oxy&#39;s or the Fentanyl, just Hydrocodone and Methadone because those were the only pills I could get my hands on living in a small town.  It just got too expensive and I was not willing to try the heroine that was offered to me so I got on the Suboxone. Would love to be off of it someday but for now it&#39;s a game changer and a life saver.</p>

<p>Fibromyalgia is awful, it&#39;s more than just pain and exhaustion, it&#39;s mental as well and it sucks. I am prescribed pregabalin for the pain, it&#39;s taken my daily pain from a 7-8 to a 4-5, so it&#39;s a considerable difference but not a cure. Some days are worse than others.</p>

<p>For my Bipolar I only take Duloxetine as an anti-depressant. Being type 2, I rarely ever get manic anymore, its mostly depression. I&#39;ve tried mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics but they just put me into zombie mode and I have a job that I need to be sharp and focused at. </p>

<p>Not much that I&#39;m taking for the Borderline. I sometimes get clonazepam here and there but my dr office is trying to get all of their patients off so they are cracking down on benzo scripts. It sucks because I understand that people are addicted to benzos as well, but it&#39;s not fair to the people who actually benefit from them. They literally improve the quality of my daily life but I can only get like 10 every 2 months. </p>

<p>With all the meds I take, I am constantly tired and sleepy. Duloxetine is supposed to help with energy levels but it doesn&#39;t really help. So I&#39;m looking for something to help with anxiety, energy levels, depression, and constipation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adrian, thanks so much for your response! Yes I understand I am only talking to my peers on here and not a regular doctor. I take everything I read with a grain of salt and always do my research when someone advises a new supplement or medication. Sometimes I feel I get more honest responses on here when it comes to how the meds actually affect people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preganenolone, NAC, Sarcosine, L-Mehtyfolate, and KSM-66 seem to offer <em>some degree</em> of assistance with BPD and  Anxiety.</p>

<p>However, Please do not forget that at the end of the day, they&#39;re classified as supplements for a reason. Medication foods <em>AT BEST</em>...</p>

<p>Please consults your doctor about why the fuck haven&#39;t you been prescribed Lithium carbonate in addition to Lamotrigine? They will do wonders for your BP2. Duloxetine is usually the SNRI of choice when someone has Fribromyalgia. However, it does have a tendency to make people irritable, also, it will not mix well with lithium nor bode well for anxiety.</p>

<p>In terms of anxiety, it&#39;s either a benzo (One must not stray away from optimal Clonazepam or Valium. However, based on what you&#39;re taking right now, the pricks must have &quot;closed off&quot; the option). </p>

<p>Vortioxetine or &quot;Brintellix/Trintellix&quot; (Multi-Modal) works quite well as both an antidepressants and an anxiolytic. </p>

<p>Last, but not least is either an SSRI such as Paroxetine in possible combination an antupyschotic that doesn&#39;t make you gain weight such as Zeldox (Ziprasidone) or Rexulti at 1-2mg (Brexpiprazole).</p>

<p>But yeah, as far as nootropics go then I&#39;m sticking to what I stated about Preganenolone (They&#39;ll flip it as a legit psychotorpic/medicine soon enough), NAC (Try your luck and see what happens [needs about 4 months to kick in]), Sarcosine (Also, try your luck and see what happens), L-Mehtyfolate (No proven benefit post 12 months), and KSM-66 (Ashwaghanda needs cycling otherwise it&#39;ll result in tolerance, certain depletions, and anhedonia). </p>

<p>There are legitimate sources for all of the above so feel free to message me if you want. I may have additional insight regarding your Fribro problem, but I&#39;m not %100 certain.</p>

<p>Always consult your healthcare provider and I wish you the best of luck and least amount of misery possible!</p>
