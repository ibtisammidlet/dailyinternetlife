<p>My guess is that it means an order of magnitude lower for the kg unit, so 0.2mg/kg<sup>-1</sup> = 0.2mg/100g or 2mg/kg?</p>

<p>But I feel like that might be incorrect because it seems like it would be really simple to just write 2mg/kg. </p>

<p>What does the <sup>-1</sup> mean in the context of mg/kg measurements?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lollol, it&#39;s fortunately much easier; you seem to have missed the missing slash in the text. It shows: “mg kg<sup>-1</sup>”, which is common scientific notation. The lack of a sign between the two base units simply represents multiplication, commonly expressed as • (not x or X as &#39;comon folk&#39; tend to write, as this quickly becomes problematic because it could then mean multiplication or just represent the algebraic value x from a formula like y=ax+b). I actually tend to write it just as mg•kg<sup>-1</sup>, which is also correct notation. Saves me from making the space too short and having to cross out mgkg, saves on writing cramps during exams..</p>

<p>Now why do they write the base units with a multiplication instead of division sign? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just common practice, such is the way of stubborn scientists, or maybe it was just to save on ink back in the day :P </p>

<p>You can probably follow that multiplication and division are exact opposites. Now doing any number x to the -1 exponent creates the inverse number (which is the same as doing 1/x) and thus: mg/kg = mg • kg<sup>-1</sup> = mg kg<sup>-1</sup></p>

<p>It might seem weird, wtf is a negative exponent supposed to be, just play with a calculator for a bit. E.g. 5 • 10 = 50, yet using the inverse of 10 and swapping / and •, 5 / 10<sup>-1</sup> = 5 / 0.1 = 50. </p>

<p>Why is 10<sup>-1</sup>=0.1? Because 1/x=1/10=0.1
and 100<sup>-1</sup>=0.01? Because 1/x=1/100=0.01</p>

<p>!If anyone is wondering yes I am procrastinating... But taking a factor 10 too much or too little can be baaaad(-ly dissapointing)(for your wallet)(or you die) so I couldn&#39;t let this slip. 
My Portuguese father just came out of the hospital from lithium toxicity (life-threatening even, 1.85 blood lvl) because some dumb fuck PT doctor upped his dosage from 600mg to 800mg, then does a test month later and thinks &quot;ok coolcoolcool, next patient&quot; now 7 months after that, he came happy and with strong cognition out of the airplane and 2 days later he looked like a severe Parkinsons Disorder patient had to pee every 30! mins, and covering the floor with a homogenous field of piss droplets, and everyone assumed bladder infection... I was like WTF if that&#39;s even related it&#39;s become blood poisoning in 2 days else the other symptoms and acuteness doesn&#39;t make sense... Get him to a damn neurologist tomorrow! Well surprise surprise, no microbial positive test, blood in urine positive though. So we would have to wait a month to see a urologist!? He would&#39;ve been dead by then or worse his mind would&#39;ve had permanent mood problems and heavily damaged memory, atop of 73 yrs of age... Thank God we ourselves asked for a lithium lvl test when my mom said he went up and was checked only once. Got an emergency call the same day late evening that an ambulance will be underway. Phew...!&lt;</p>

<p>!His mind already is at a point where he&#39;d need a little boost, would give him Cere but he&#39;s 85% of time in PT and I don&#39;t imagine he would be prepping that himself. Is Pinealon effective enough orally? Or is IN just to keep costs down. Fortunately no FDA here in Europe... Still scared they&#39;ll rip everyone&#39;s choice away soon enough, whether you don&#39;t want to use something with shitloads of SAE&#39;s and negligible efficacy or you want to take something with zero moderate or severe adverse effects and high efficacy with orders of magnitude more time and research proving both... /rant! !&lt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right I didn&#39;t read your screenshot apart from looking at the mg kg<sup>-1</sup> thing. As this is research done in rats you&#39;ll have to transform the dosages mentioned into human doses, which are very very different, even though we use mg•kg<sup>-1</sup>. Google is your friend, think there&#39;s even some automatic rat to human dose calculators out there.
Let me know if anything&#39;s wasn&#39;t clear:)</p>
