        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been debating on what sub to post this in: r/nootropics r/drugnerds r/researchchems but I finally settled on here because I’m assuming a few of your guys have tabernathalog experience. I just ordered some from Australia, I’m not expecting a nootropic effect or a typical nootropic effect. But having just gone through a half sheet of really decent lsd microdosing recreational dosing and everything in between. I’ve been thinking about my next conquest and it popped up before I decided to drive down to Denver for some booms. I digress.</p>

<p>Iboga or ibogamine has fascinated me with its super complex pharmacology. 5ht2a, nmda, kor and more especially if there are other iboga alkaloids. Which honestly sounds personally like a recipe for a bad trip but I’ve read really compelling and some fantastical accounts of life changing experiences from depression to an an account of a heroin addict being relieved of physical opioid addiction. </p>

<p>Long story short a very complex pharmacology on it’s own seems to have major potential. I plan on microdosing and most likely taking a dose for a real iboga experience.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to chime in with any thoughts about iboga or tabernathalog (iirc reading can be quite the psychoactive experience it self)
I’m open to any thoughts but I love talking pharmacology.</p>

<p>I do want to not before discussing that im not not naive enough to think the purchase might be bunk or lack luster.</p>

<p>Edit: ibogaine is the main alkaloid not ibogamine.
Also the alkaloids according to wiki are:</p>

<p>Ibogaine
Iboxygaine
Ibogaline
Alloibogaine
Catharanthine
Ibogamine
Noribogaine
Voacangine
Yohimbine
Hydroxyibogamine</p>

<p>Iirc most have unique pharmacological profiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did an ibogaine flood dose (under medical supervision). It saved my life. I went two years drinking 10-14 drinks a night, maybe staying sober 4-5 days a month? After ibogaine paired with 5-meo-dmt, I’ve drank probably 5 times in the last 6 months, and all those times I just drank my favorite dark beer 1-2 beer with dinner nights. It’s a crazy drug. Oh and I met what I perceived as god. Kirby took me to see him (yea, like Kirby from the game boy games lol)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your experience sounds typical at this point. 
I personally don’t really need a life changer right now so I’m afraid of it. 
I’ve been dabbling with some microdosing and very sub threshold effects. I did take around ten drops and about a half dose lsd and had a moment where I began feeling my teeth and closed my eyes and for a second it was like the only thing that existed was the feeling of my teeth. Then I caught myself and decided I didn’t really feel like embracing that deep of an experience and then kinda went on with the night lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Micro dosing ibogaine…I wouldn’t worry….its half life is long, but its metabolite nor ibogaine is even longer. I would suggest starting with 25mg (assuming ibogaine HCL) in the morning and dose it no more frequently then every 4 days. I weigh 200lbs (very low BF), and I can not feel it at all. Once every other month I will do 150-200mg, and that I can feel. I’m like ohh boy, the world is amazing let’s go save the world!!!! </p>

<p>And ibogaine is stimulating. Your coffee is gonna hit harder on the microdose days</p>

I need to start daily I’ve only tried small sub percepable doses so far but I do think it had a next day mood lifting effect and I’m not sure if it’s afterglow or the noribogaine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been using iboga home made TA and it was really amazing experience. I been taking one capsule every morning with cup of coffee and was buzzing till late afternoon. Great nootropic effect plus strong connection with myself and environment.</p>

<p>One downside was problem with falling asleep and even if that happened, sleep was very shallow with plenty visual like dreams.
Also I had a problem with driving at night due to that fluidy golden visuals on the periphery of my vision. Sometimes I was strong and sometimes less but this was actually quite cool and didn’t affect my that bad.</p>

<p>All together I believe it was on of the best microdosing exp of my life and wish to repeat it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you!!!! I’ve been reading about this for years and it takes an instagram ad to get me to do anything about it.
Do you have experience with more typical psychedelics like lsd or mushrooms. Because for me I don’t really like lsd the experience I do like the next day I get very emotional but overall pretty disassociating or a major body load which I think might come down to how fresh and or properly handled it was. (I have a major suspicion that it doesn’t just degrade but turns into other lysergamides) but a good micro dose kinda gets me into great head space. I have this “fuck it it doesn’t matter when on psychedelics” which on lsd just makes me not worry about the things that don’t matter. Mushrooms on the other hand I have had no such luck microdosing. I’ll get a minor buzz but not practically helpful. But on like a gram to an eighth I get very grounded in my body opposed to dissociation and never the heavy body load but none of the more therapeutic effects but way more fun in the moment.</p>

<p>Would you be able to personally compare it to either. To me it sounds more like my experience of a lsd microdose.</p>

<p>Also did you ever push the dose to a more full “trip”
And thank you for the feed back</p>

<p>Edit: one last question. Would you describe the nootropic effect along the lines of actual enhanced cognition like faster at a word puzzle for instance or more general mental well-being.
Thanks again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i have plenty of experience with most classic and some RC. Psychodelics. Mostly with ayahuasca and dmt and drugs like ketamine and dissociatives in general.</p>

<p>Actually I cannot compare it to anything like lsd or mushrooms. Lsd microdose doesn’t go well with me, similar mushrooms as they give me anxiety ( talking about microdosing ).
Iboga microdosing is unique in its own class. Very analitical with plenty of insights about your behaviour patterns and relationships with other humans. At least in my experience. 
My head wasn’t clear and often a bit cloudy and I felt slightly disconnected from reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s been my concern is the kappa receptor agonism along with the nmda antagonism. I’m pretty sensitive to nmda dissos like I feel into a hole on a 10 mg memantine dose and I just don’t like it. I could go on. But won’t.</p>

<p>Although I was just looking seems to be equipotent at at least binding to the mor receptor. </p>

<p>That said i think I’ll approach it like dxm microdosing. Sub plateau very serotonergic vibes. And I guess I’ll flirt with what might be analogous and see how unpleasant it may or may not be then see if I have the guts to have a real trip.
This is all in reference to dosage. Not comparing the actual substances.</p>

<p>Basically do what I do with every substance nootropic or otherwise start low.
Did you ever take an active dose or actual have an erowid worthy trip?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m also very sensitive to iboga. I can feel it affecting me in very small doses of plain root bark.  I just want you to know that my experiments have place somethings like 6 years ago and I don’t remember everything as good.</p>

<p>I had something like 50g of camerun bark and similar amount of different origin which was very strong.
I prepared for flood dose but unfortunately I took not enough and just tripped unmobilised whole night in the bed. I still experienced x- ray phenomena and had powerful out of body vision in the space where Peter Pan was showing me the door and in the background i saw our galactic. Everything was looking like high definition cartoon.
Rest of the trip was full of paranoja, heavy feelings and something like brain zaps but very strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that’s my worry the pharmacology really tells me a full experience would be less than pleasant if not pretty fuckin bad. the anecdotes of people overcoming major mental challenges like depression or addiction etc. etc. kinda seem like the most appropriate time to really go for it. Bad trips for me often have good outcomes but mentally I’m pretty strong right now and sometimes a bad trip is just a bad trip.</p>

<p>But if I’m understanding you correctly you had a rough time but actually meant to go deeper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was quite difficult trip but there was my fault as well I believe. Trip happening after one month of microdosing and probably I gave myself serotonin syndrome or something that’s why I had this brain zaps. Noribogaine is ssri and my system was flooded with it. I heard that people should microdose after not before. Honestly I’m not sure its right hypothesis as I’m not a expert.</p>

<p>Yes, I was hoping for flood experience and for one I set my mind . Maybe good its happened differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there’s a ton of different pharmacology among the different alkaloids. But yeah it’s possible but so complicated I wouldn’t say anything for certain. But idk, if that’s a common belief on dosing it’d be really hard to know exactly why. It’s also a psychoplastogen maybe you had an up regulation or some sort of neuroplastic changes that altered your response to the dose maybe it’s unpleasant. Regardless..
I actually planned on kinda doing something similar but in a more start small possibly taper up possibly microdose for a while if I find it beneficial at that but I’m thinking in a more rapid fashion id like to push the limits and see if I respond well. If I do decide to take a threshold dose it’ll probably be multiple smaller doses over a couple hours not all at once. But we’ll see</p>

<p>How did you feel the next day and after both in terms of a hang over and any shift in mindset or headspace?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt quite depressed and very tired for last couple days. I can say that even more than after average acid trip where duration was almost the same. I mean technically  after trip because my perception was affected for quite a long time. I could see traces in lightly dimmed places for couple months. I don’t think it was caused by noribogaine because I don’t think it stay that long in the system. It was probably something more like soft hppd or something.</p>

<p>After few days got better and start feel antidepressant effects for few weeks until I got slightly drunk at the party. Everything changed since then. I felt like each day coming back to bad habits and started to think about everything but not what was important at that time.
I can tell that alcohol took it away from me and next time I would make different choices.
Hopefully one day because I can still get it even if take a risk from LE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have had something like serotonin syndrome. Possibly like a serotoninergic insult there a I’m pet sure that there’s a whole sub for people who have permanent vision changes from extacy and mdma use/abuse. I might be miss remembering but that doesn’t sound dissimilar. 
Well I’m not exactly sure what my source is like but the site is really professional I can share it with you. It was like around fifty for what I now think is the trial bottle. I was too excited to read all the literature before I bought but I’m sure there’s enough for a dose like you might be looking for.
Another thing I’d share person to person is that for me at least once I stopped getting down on myself for fuckin up it made it far easier to start trying and eventually having not really control but a grip on negative behaviors I still drink too much too often and stay up a couple nights on adderall but I don’t feel stuck in a cycle and I recognize when I’m starting to. For instance let’s say I were to go out to dinner and tell myself I’m not drinking tonight but end up going to the bar after I already had three beers somewhere in that moment I tell myself “yeah dude you’re fuckin up right now it’s not the end of the world and since I’m already started I might as well have fun” and the next time I do the same thing it’s made it easier for me to say well I already had beers with dinner I’m should just go home. 
I found that shaming myself was hindering and or preventing progress.
I’m not sure if that applies to you or your situation but it’s something I still do today and has helped me more than any counseling or programs.</p>

<p>Like I said I’m not sure if that’s applicable to you or your situation but I share that any chance I get.</p>
