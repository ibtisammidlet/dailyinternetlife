        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(Sorry was trying to post this on Nootropics subreddit but no matter what I changed in my text it didn&#39;t let me post it without deleting it right away)</p>

<p>Im trying to treat the heavy symptoms of my depression and social anxiety including no drive, energy, motivation, no appetite, very bad cognition ( a handful of friends already asked me if I have ADD). Well</p>

<p>Im treatment-resistant (at least from official requirements) after I tried about 15 different meds of all the possible different classes (except the stronger MAOIs, Ketamine, psychedelics) as well as 2 analytical depth-psychological and 1 cognitive-behavioral therapy without any success.</p>

<p>Well, only med working is the last one I was prescribed but as its Pregabalin I can&#39;t take it daily (because it won&#39;t work anymore after 2 days in a row for me and I don&#39;t want to become addicted and suffer withdrawals).</p>

<p>Not too much about this but rather about the trial of my actual stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ALCAR</strong> 2,000mg</li>
<li><strong>Gotu Kola</strong> 1,500mg (extract = 9000mg Gotu Kola, of which 15mg asiaticosides &amp; 88mg L-Leucin)</li>
<li><strong>Bacopa</strong> 320mg (Doctor&#39;s Best &quot;Synapsa&quot; extract of which 55% so 176mg bacosides)</li>
<li><strong>L-Citrulline</strong> 6,000mg (Malate 2:1)</li>
<li><strong>Inositol</strong> 14,000-20,000mg</li>
<li><strong>Omega 3 Fish Oil</strong> 4,000mg (of which 720mg EPA &amp; 480mg DHA)</li>
<li><strong>Black Seed Oil</strong> 3 teaspoons or 1 tablespoon</li>
<li><strong>Multivitamin Complex</strong> (+ 30 active ingredients, lactobacillus, acidophilus, COQ10, lycopene, quercitine etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>To this I use <strong>Kratom</strong> if needed (but really mostly daily the last month) of 500mg each dose, which might end at a maximum total of 5g per day - but definitely have to quit using it as a daily thing for sure. And <strong>Pregabalin (Lyrica)</strong> prescribed if needed which I originally limited to 2-3x/week but now take 4x/week with 3 days off.</p>

<p>I never tried the total stack in combination with my Pregabalin because I was worried about possible interactions that might be unhealthy, especially concerned about Inositol and Black Seed Oil with Pregabalin because of the GABA affinity. Might there be a reason to not take these together?</p>

<p>The ALCAR, Gotu Kola, Bacopa, fish oil and vitamins weren&#39;t any issue with Pregabalin as well as with Kratom.</p>

<p>What do you think about this stack for depression, social anxiety, ADD symptoms, low drive/energy/motivation? Let me know about any other suggestions or assumptions.</p>

<p>Thankful for your comments guys &lt;3!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many potential things to add into your stack, but I would go first for quality magnesium threonate (and taurate since it contains anti-anxiety taurine what is cheap separately, and mag-glycinate what contains anti-anxiety glycine what I would or do take also separately). At least so many anecdotes here in Reddit about good impact of it, and good for addictions and generally nootropic stacks should usually begin with such micro-nutrients of which you may have some lack and most of people in western world using diuretics such as coffee with lot of sugars do have magnesium lack. Mayby the reason it has such proven impact on anxiety issues + co-factor for cellular energy production too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had my third test already now and I don‘t lack any of the (micro-)nutrients. Which one is good for addictions you said? Mag in general, so both? I would definitely adore an anti-anxiety effect but I remember to even have tried the more expensive and exclusive Threonate without any success or reduction in my symptoms after the Magnesium citrate and Magnesium bisglycinate didn‘t work out for me… :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NMDA antagonists are said to be good for addictions, and for micro-nutrients zinc and magnesium are those. Or actually when co-used with addictive substances, then addiction would develop less addiction is being said. Of course as natural stuff wont do much, but of course as natural stuff has good safety profile and loads of other benefits.</p>

<p>Agmatine is neglected supplement - almost impossible to aquire in EU - what also has that activity and is said to be good for addictions also via other mechanisms, as it is natural neurotransmitter and appears to regulate behaviour.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ipqhzu/agmatine_sulfate_has_completely_changed_me_9/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ipqhzu/agmatine_sulfate_has_completely_changed_me_9/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ht9hvr/agmatine_sulfate_miracle_substance_with_endless/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ht9hvr/agmatine_sulfate_miracle_substance_with_endless/</a></p>

<p>For me silence around agmatine is strange. Or in Europe of course since you cannot get it from anywhere (<a href="https://aniracetam.eu">aniracetam.eu</a> had it at least, what recently opened). But also in my opinion addiction control should be top priorities among nootropic substances. Addiction here does not refer to substances as such, but like social media behaviour or all sorts of behaviour.</p>

<p>Apart from direct NMDA-antagonism, NMDA-fine tuning with D-serine, glycine may be helpful.</p>

<p>But pregabalin is gabaergic substance which is more rudimentary antagonism of glutamate system such as NMDA, so if getting out of that direct gabaergic stuff will be needed. Of course they happen to be addictive if seriously effective, so wide stack of mild non-addictive choices is to be recommended which could at least little bit mildly work. Taurine is good on being cheap and as natural component with zillion functions in our bodies and central nervous system, is really safe but very very seldomly talked among nootropic circuits despite I always liked it.</p>

<p>For more far-reaching and of course expensive gabaergic substances Selank peptide would be choice, as it mostly works by epigenetic means enhancing natural gabaergic system in the way that is not addictive as such and will remain for long after usage period, but works to break addictions for gabaergic and endorphoergic stuff. Within Russian pharmacology it was developed and adminstrated just for all that. Thing though is, you may not feel much as it is very subtle and impact would build over time, and would last after you finished with it. But it is very personal with substances working partially via epigenetic ways, people with actual and serious anxiety issues have occasionally put out strong anecdotes whilst normal people seemingly dont get much. But ability to repair GABA-system damaged via certain medics is important.</p>

<p>NAC of course is classic for anti-addictions but there is already so much output about it that I wont write.</p>

<p>Out of wonderworld of -racetams, Fasoracetam has the magic of upregulating GABA-B transmission in long run use (acute impact may be opposite) and it is often praised by Phenibut users of helping with WD syndromes, and lowering the tolerance. No idea how it would help with Gabapentinoid conventional medicine, but anything gabaergic way or another ought to relieve at least a little bit.</p>

<p>Out of mild herbal stuff increasing GABA without addictive propensities, there are numerous choices, and mayby could help a little bit if used as a wide stack as they should due to their mildness. But that subject would deserve a separate reply, and also others here could contribute at this point. You already appear to have Gotu Kola and Bacopa in your stack out of those, and Passiflora is something what is pretty neglected but appears to have good anti-addiction potential along with positive anecdotes here.</p>

<p>Addiction dissolution is IMO subject what should get the most greatest attention as our entertainment-centered individual liberalist culture is actually just based on all sorts of addictions what suprisingly are being so neglected in field of conventional pharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It‘s the other way round. Pregabalin can be by far more dangerous and a big living hell to come off. It‘s addictive too as tolerance increases rapidly. </p>

<p>I think anyone who experienced both would rather get hooked on Kratom again to get off of it again and withdrawing than doing this with Pregabalin. Also dosing Pregabalin has much more medical risks, dangers or side effects than dosing Kratom.</p>

<p>Anyways both are shit if hooked on them for sure. </p>

<p>Kratom is killing my depression for the short time it works and its helping me a lot with focus and getting my ass to do some work, cleaning or important paper stuff, university tasks and studying. And I was hooked on it once already so I know what it can bring me to. Sadly I just jumped on the daily kratom train again now, I dont even know why or how it got to that, it went so fast and now I’m 1 month in, I guess my brain is still deep in it addicted to Kratom. </p>

<p>It‘s 100% my plan to get away from daily Kratom (again) and only use it rarely on occasion. I reduced a lot so I hope it works out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I dont talk about curing, its also a treating thats very short lived, but it definitely kills depressive thoughts and negative thinking for the time it‘s effective (at least for me). And as I suffered and still suffer very horrible painful depression and had unbelievably negative thoughts that were a physical pain themselves Kratom was / is so tempting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya on that man.</p>

<p>I used Kratom to get sober, it definitely worked, and temporarily alleviated the unbearable depression after ruining my life with drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>I quickly was up to 10 grams every 2 hours, over 100 gpd.  </p>

<p>My life is better now, I’m down to 50 gpd, but it’s still a major struggle to get off of, or even cut back.</p>

<p>At higher doses , like 40+ gpd, it seems to elevate prolactin and lower testosterone….which basically gives it the opposite effect (increasing depression and lack of motivation) of its short term effects.</p>

<p>High prolactin makes me crave comfort….it sucks…. Should be craving accomplishment and adventure.</p>

<p>5 gpd I don’t think is enough to cause that though.</p>

<p>I’ve added P5p to my stack to try and lower the prolactin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I mean, Kratom is recreational it’s not a medicine. Like you could say opiates “cure depression” but really it’s just intoxicating. 
Pregabalin is a common treatment off label for anxiety and in my experience has no withdrawal effects. A lot of that is over blown in the media etc, but it really isn’t so strong that it would cause respiratory depression or withdrawal symptoms. It’s extremely safe and very few people are experiencing physical addiction from it. Kratom on the other hand is totally unregulated, an opioid receptor agonist, and definitely has a physical dependency and habituation component. 
All opioid like substances do this. And I know people are really defensive over their drugs and whether they are safe, I say it’s all good, but do be educated and watch out for denial because the last thing you want in your life is an opioid addiction, trust me I know this from personal experience. It starts with depression, or boredom, which is a manageable issue, but if you dip into these substances too hard then end can be way way worse than depression and it can take years to get rid of. That kratom shit is insidious because they sell it everywhere and people really don’t even know how bad it can be. 
Anyway that’s my insight.</p>
