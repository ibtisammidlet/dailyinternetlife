        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone! I am new to nootropics and I was wondering if anyone has ADHD and have done a deep dive into what nootropics help the most. I am about to sit for a 5 hour long certification exam in 2 weeks. I know some nootropics need to be consumed for about a month to really show effects, but what has worked best for you? I will be taking it along side of my Adderall prescription. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are barking up the right tree with the nootropics angle. Many types in my stack!</p>

<p>I am very ADHD and Bipolar so cannot take stimulants. I am also doing an Engineering diploma, so I supplement aggressively!</p>

<p>Here is a list of my morning stack... </p>

<p>Mindlab Pro, (2 caps)
L-Phenylalanine,
Niacin 50mg, (promotes neurogenesis combined with psylocibin and lionsmane, search for stammets stack)
Multi B vitamin, (Solgar)
Mindlab performance lab PL immune,
Vegan algae oil, (Feel)
Phosphatidylserine 160mg, (a top up on the mindlab dose)
300mg of phylocibin mushroom caps, (homemade from scratch) 
Teaspoon of lionsmane, (in mindlab also)</p>

<p>At night
NAC 1400mg,
Glycine  3g,
Organic mucuna puriens 1800mg,
L Theanine 500mg,
Gaba 500mg,
Melatonin 1.9mg,
Niacin 500mg,
Zinc and copper, magnesium and B6 ZMA 677mg caps,
L Tyrosine 500mg.</p>

<p>The most notable things that I have used are the mindlab pro and the L-Phenylanine (now make). If I had to just take two it would be them. Magnesium is very helpful also. </p>

<p>Exciting new research on microdosing psylocibin and adhd! Definitely helps, it beat aderall in trials.</p>

<p>We are all different but I hope this gives you some ideas on experimentation. I also have an organic vegan wholefoods diet. </p>

<p>I found some amonita muscaria recently which is an interesting mushroom but still researching it. </p>

<p>There are reasons behind all of these. I have also been influenced by longevity research. </p>

<p>Oh yes, daily exercise and cold showers. </p>

<p>Any questions then fire away!</p>

<p>(Apologise for spelling errors!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also have ADHD here. What dose of phenylalanine do you take and how many times daily. Does it work if you have it with food? By the way, I wouldn’t personally combine copper and zinc in the stomach as it has shown in human studies to be highly toxic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got the idea watching ADHD Dr legrand on youtube. He used a DL phenylalanine which is slightly different and he claims more effective. You see there are two types and combining the two may offer even more benefit.</p>

<p>He takes 2000mg split between morning and afternoon as his PEA was low. Personally I take just 1000mg L-Phenylananine in the morning and that is fine. </p>

<p>He claimed when he stopped taking it for 4 days his memory improvement dissapeared. </p>

<p>I have not really challenged myself on it but feel calmer and more focused. It is supposed to also improve memory, but not really studied or really put my brain to the test yet.</p>

<p>I do feel good on it, my mood also improved so would reccomend trying it. It is a precursor to all of the main neurotransmitters and also PEA. </p>

<p>I am no expert but look on youtube for his videos for more details.</p>

<p>Unless you have all of your bloods thoroughly checked it is hard to say if it will benefit you. It is one of the top supplements for ADHD and as it is a precursor to everything I would recommend trying it. </p>

<p>I have it on an empty stomach which probably speeds the effect, it is noticable within about an hour or so.</p>

<p>Ps Niacin could be worth a punt for ADHD too. Its cheap and can be very effective, 500mg at night. Use the flushing variety, you get used to it, just dont panic as it only lasts an hour. (You go bright red)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it s in two weeks, there aren’t many things to do except adderall + caffeine + sleep + good food.</p>

<p>If it was long term, I would advice blood tests, treat vitamin deficiencies and do sports.</p>

<p>Anyway, either nootropics are near useless next to adderal + coffee for adhd people, either they are way riskier. You are free to try whatever you feel like trying tho, just for the sake of it or in case something hits a broken button in you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see this post. Anyone suggesting an off the shelf supplement and expecting any improvement over a stimulant is getting hammered by the placebo effect. Tyrosine and Alpha GPC and making sure your vitamin base is covered will do wonders though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotu Kola has a good effect on memory and a calming effect. </p>

<p>Easy to find in herbal shops if you start taking it now it could have some effect, although two weeks is a bit short.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I had to point out recomendations for you then defintely the Mindlab pro. </p>

<p>I got 84% on a maths test using it after very little sleep, also ran beforehand and had a cold shower.</p>

<p>Magnesium Citrate 350mg and L- Phenylalanine 1000mg to 2000mg per day could also definitely help with study, as they would calm and boost recall.</p>

<p>Mindlab pro has several ingridients that help with ADHD and is high quality. Expensive but worth it in my opinion.</p>

<p>If you buy it in bulk on their website it is alot cheaper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant see these touching the sides if you&#39;re already on medication tbh, that should be enough? I&#39;ve tried tons of supplements and maybe Tyrosine and Alpha GPC had a mild effect but probably 10% of the efficacy of actual medication. I know some people like to set fire to hundreds of dollars per month in these stacks but sticking to the basics and having a solid exercise routine and sleep schedule will greatly compliment the meds.</p>
