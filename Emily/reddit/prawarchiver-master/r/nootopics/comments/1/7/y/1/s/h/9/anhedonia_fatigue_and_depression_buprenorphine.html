        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I&#39;ve have been lurking on r/NooToopics for some time and seen people looking for a boost in dopamine by increasing Gaba or stuff working on the opiod receptors. </p>

<p>I would love to try some or the stuff suggested but I am on a Buvidal injection (buprenorphine depo) which is essentially a blocker on my opiod receptors. For this reason I feel I would be wasting my money. I have already started dropping down to quit and should be off in the next month but it lingers up, sometimes 9-12 month in the system. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t even get runners high, I just want to feel joy and motivation again! </p>

<p>Would I be better off just sitting it out until it has left my system? </p>

<p>Can anybody shed some light on this? </p>

<p>Also could anybody recommend anything to stay in deep sleep?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on Sublocade and use many nootropics that don&#39;t interfere. The biggest two that have helped me are Sarcosine and Saffron. I can also take both of those while also on antidepressants too. They have helped me quite a bit! They are a bit &quot;lesser&quot; of nootropics and a good place to start, I think. Don&#39;t expect a miraculous transition, like how we feel on opiates, but it&#39;s definitely worth it for me!</p>

<p>Edit: I also second a sleep study. I have central apneas from buprenorphine and those can be detrimental in the long run if not addressed. I&#39;m using a cpap, and because of how I feel (fatigued), put me on Modafanil, which gave me a tad more motivation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that will work best for this BY Far is Low Dose Naltrexone. It partially antagonizes the opiate receptors and then your body responds by producing a cascade of natural endorphins. It’s non addictive and can completely eradicate OAWS symptoms in many. </p>

<p>You can get relatively cheap in the US through agelessrx.com</p>

<p>I’ve seen many people struggling for months with these symptoms have them gone in a week</p>

<p>One caveat is you need to be off all opioids including things like kratom for at least a week or more for it to work</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same.</p>

<p>The first time I got off bup I felt like shit for months. I&#39;m on it again now and want to be off of it. Over 3 years into recovery but after the first 15 months I still felt like absolute shit, tired, fatigued, depression, no motivation, anhedonia, lethargy. My counselor suggested I get back on bup so I did and it helped a ton. </p>

<p>I just did an overnight sleep study and found I have sleep apnea (obstructive I&#39;m pretty sure). One thing to be aware of is that opioids can cause central brain sleep apnea. If you&#39;re waking up tired and feel tired and fatigued all day that MAY be the issue. </p>

<p>I just started armodafinil for the sleep apnea so I&#39;m using this opportunity to decrease and try to get off of bup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had a few people suggest I do a sleep study and as silly as it sounds I&#39;ve used the sleep monitoring app and had a few warnings on there. Thanks for the advice.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking what dose of bupe have you been put on to feel this way? I was put onto 16mg from a mild addiction and have always felt over medicated. When requesting to be put down I was put on the buvidal shot 128mg which is equivalent to 16mg a day due to bioavailability. I&#39;ve recently moved down and I&#39;m really hoping to get some energy back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take suboxone and have had no problems with any nootropics not working.
Here is what I take on a daily basis. And I am going to put everything I take, even other daily meds and I take some peptides too.</p>

<p>》Morning《
☆Sabroxy- this is my absolute favorite. It helps my vyvanse last longer. 
☆Dynamomine
☆Cortagen-occasionally but will be trying Cerebrolysin next
☆Vyvanse
☆N-Acetyl Carnitine 
☆Bromantane 
☆ Tyrosine but about to try N-Acetyl Tyrosine instead
☆Oxytocin- occasionally 
●Aniracetam 
●Noopept nasal spray 
●Oxiracetam 
●The last 3 I have just started, so I will switch out. First tried Noopept and awesome the first 3 days. Then, it will still make me feel better, but no extra feelings of any sort. So then I started Aniracetam, and that helps with energy way better. Sometimes, I take them both, but I&#39;m currently out of Noopept. I have not taken Oxiracetam yet. Just got the bottle.
☆Birth control
☆A piece of suboxone- I get 8mg films. I tear off like 1/4 of it</p>

<p>》Evenings《
☆Dextroamphetamine 
☆ sabroxy if I&#39;m sleepy and my stimulants aren&#39;t working well. 
☆Another 1/4 of Suboxone </p>

<p>》Night, currently《
☆Prozac
☆Tirzepatide 
☆Semax
☆Ghk-cu 
☆Thymosin Alpha-1 
☆Epitalon 
☆Magnesium blend of citrate and bisglycinate 
☆Tumeric
☆Taurine
☆Magnesium threonate- occasionally if needed
☆B-complex vitamin
☆Iron 
☆Methylfolate
☆Vitamin C
☆And another piece of sub.</p>

<p>I have never felt better, my skin is so nice, and it has definitely lifted alot of brain fog.</p>
