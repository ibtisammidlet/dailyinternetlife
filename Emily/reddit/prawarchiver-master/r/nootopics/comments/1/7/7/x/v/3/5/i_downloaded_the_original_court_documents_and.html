    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully one day we can push for a legal avenue for people who want to sell nootropics over the counter. There&#39;s really no valid reason to ban Piracetam, just an authoritative push for maintaining the current pharmaceutical system. Pharmaceutical companies could make money selling these things over the counter. As long as it fits Corneliu&#39;s guidelines for safety I don&#39;t see a moral problem with it. Obviously the FDA would like their power moves to be seen as them being ethical but that&#39;s not really the case.</p>

<p>As for Phenibut and Tianeptine, I&#39;m not as quick to defend them. But it&#39;s unfair to put everything on a level playing field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think about things from the perspective of &quot;what do we want to be viewed as to the public&quot;. If you tie addictive drugs into what could be a harmless, borderline supplement-like interest, then you&#39;re spoiling the cause. I like to follow Corneliu&#39;s guidelines for nootropics, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to sell anything that could get someone addicted, even if I do believe in people having the power to make their own decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also don&#39;t mean to drag more discussion of substances like that into it, it&#39;s just what the guy currently has is harmless in the grand scheme of things to me. If they&#39;re gonna pursue him are they going to pursue gas stations for largely making income off purchases of energy drinks and  moist snuff? That&#39;s what the FDA views as the number one contributing factor to substance use issues in the USA let alone subversion from government offices? Really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just amusing to me how people are getting in trouble for selling piracetam. It just makes me think of the places where it&#39;s legal to buy cocaine and meth, like what?? (Not that I personally agree with it or not)</p>

<p>I wish there was a way to kick the FDA&#39;s ass and have them fuck off. I always fear that they&#39;re going to start messing with sirsadalot.</p>

<p>Is there ever anything we can do to mitigate further growth of the FDA&#39;s control and power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically all of this has to with one men behind the attack against supplements and nootropics: Pieter D Cohen:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a36945827/toxic-supplement-hunter-pieter-cohen-md/">https://www.menshealth.com/health/a36945827/toxic-supplement-hunter-pieter-cohen-md/</a></p>

<p>Here you can read his crussade against Piracetam. This was published in 2020, so one year before the Piracetam ban started.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902196/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902196/</a></p>

<p>This men has an obsessive and personal affair against nootropics. He was responsible for placing piracetam in the category of toxic and dangerous drug by the FDA.
It will be a relief for freedom and human progress when this guy stops bothering us with his sick obsession (for whatever reasons he disappears, but he leaves soon!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is interesting… interesting how racetams have been included there and things like prl-853 haven’t. Does this imply FDA now certifies prl-853?</p>

<p>Although selling phenibut and tianeptine is a bit shady though… the former one is well known to have addictive properties and latter is kind of mu-opioid agonist… of course I can understand everything has it’s place and a role.</p>

<p>Overall, cannot side with FDA on this, should have issued something analogous to cease and desist…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FDA explicitly began going after racetams a few years ago. The most I can speculate is that piracetam is being studied as a possible medical treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and could be profitable if it becomes an FDA approved treatment. There are not many approved treatments for Alzheimers. I didn&#39;t look too closely into it, but the quality of studies has been poor. The clampdown has been indirect by pressuring payment processors, who push vendors into smaller markets. Ceretropic had to shut down because they could not get payment processors to work with them, and the market of consumers that will use crypto is too small to sustain the scale they had grown into.</p>

<p>Phenibut was always just a matter of time as GABAnergic drugs get heavy scrutiny, and its addictive properties make it very undesirable as a nootropic. The long half-life also makes it much more addiction-prone than GHB, which requires active redosing 24/7. However, the compulsion to keep redosing GHB is much stronger due to its much stronger effects.</p>

<p>Nootropics Depot&#39;s plea agreement is one year of probation with no fines, as they are more interested in signaling to other vendors that they will take legal action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mu-opioid receptor made me think, well, but what about Kratom? Where is the line? I thought the line was scheduling drugs and clarifying analogs. Ok that&#39;s fine, I can understand scheduling and the regulation of analogs, but none of the stuff they are attacking are scheduled. It&#39;s like one branch of the FDA knows that they can&#39;t get things scheduled that they would like to, so they set their sights on other ways to pass penalties or punishments. Specifically the document said that these are “prescription drugs due to their toxicity and potential for harmful effect” and that he sold them without a prescription or prescribers license.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phenibut and tianeptine does have scientific research showing addiction liability, and those studies were published during the time ND were selling them, so they knew about it. I think that’s the true reason the government attacked. Because in the plea agreement, they demand asset forfeiture only from the sales of tianeptine. And they did not demand asset forfeiture from any other compound sales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know if they sent them a cease and desist about Tianeptine? Even so, why don&#39;t they schedule Tianeptine first? I don&#39;t necessarily have anything against that, there is a concerning amount of addiction, and subreddits dedicated to people that are very seriously addicted to it. Transparency is a very important topic to me, and it&#39;s one our government absolutely sucks at. I&#39;m fine if things are spelled out. You may not agree with something that is spelled out and the restrictions enacted, but you know the lines and you choose to cross them or not cross them. Nonetheless, I still come back to their definitions and descriptions. Seems wrong to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m getting really heated and upset about this. It has nothing to do with <a href="/u/misteryouaresodumb">/u/misteryouaresodumb</a> specifically, but the fact that according to the first document, it states that,</p>

<p>“these drugs are <strong>prescription drugs</strong> due to their toxicity and potential for harmful effect” and “Central Bioscience and Eftang sold these <strong>prescription drugs</strong> without a prescription from a practitioner license to administer such drugs.” </p>

<p>Wtf? Specifically, they are staying that anything can be classified as a prescription drug if it has the potential for toxicity or harmful affect. Is this really a law? That could be just about any nootropic. Yes, more government control and charging vendors with misdemeanors is definitely the answer.</p>
