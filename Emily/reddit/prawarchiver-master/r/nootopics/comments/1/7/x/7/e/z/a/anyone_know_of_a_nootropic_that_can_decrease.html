I’ve been doing a lot of reading on dynorphins and kappa opioid receptor antagonists, and I’m really starting to believe that something that can decrease dynorphin, or act as an antagonist at kappa opioid receptors may help me. Unfortunately, κOR antagonists are not available as prescription medications yet, and they are impossible to find for a reasonable price online.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of any drugs or nootropics fitting this description that are available for a reasonable price? If so, please let me know! Also if anyone knows of any other ways to reduce dynorphin, I would love to hear it. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’m far too neurologically illiterate to understand half of your post but as far as drug resistant depression goes, 9-Me-BC was an awesome cycle for me. </p>

<p>it’s the worst thing i ever tasted in my life but i was taking it to reduce my depression and anhedonia after no prescription meds would and also lower my adderall tolerance.</p>

<p>world felt a tiny bit brighter and i felt slightly more motivated on day 1. day 7 i felt like an entirely new person. day 8 i took an adderall out of habit, it hit me like a mack truck, i couldn’t sleep at all that night, had to take adderall again the next day to make it through work, and essentially ruined my entire 9-me-bc cycle.</p>

<p>i actually just ordered more to try again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to hear!</p>

<p>How do you take it?  I’ve been doing 30 mg sublingual 10 minutes this time, seems dramatically more effective than oral.</p>

<p>I’m on day 6 of my cycle….been having a General disinterest in life, super fatigue, high prolactin, low testosterone, and my stimulant meds are barely working, followed by a horrible crash.</p>

<p>I think I might actually be starting to notice a difference, subtle though.</p>

<p>I was able to get out of bed fairly easy this morning, which is huge.  Had first morning wood in over a month too.</p>

<p>Even cut back Kratom yesterday, something I’m really hoping to accomplish, I can’t even function without it.</p>

<p>Trying to not take my meds, but I really needed them 2 days ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah it really starts to shine later in the cycle but adderall seems to have reversed its effects for me. i really have to commit to at least 2 weeks off adderall to successfully do it, i just work in sales and i need to be super on point every single day so its stressful.</p>

<p>i usually did 15mg orally and 15mg sublingually. i had the tincture so i would squirt a like 1.5ml down the back of my throat so i wouldn’t have to taste it, then i’d leave 0.5ml under my tongue for like 2 minutes 3 times. </p>

<p>i don’t think i could sit there with 3ml of this stuff under my tongue for 10 minutes! how do you do that?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’m really hopeful with this one….I’ve spent over $3,000 on nootropics, and many do help, but it’s too subtle considering how severe my ADHD is.</p>

<p>This one is so interesting because it may restore dopamine density and function, without being a strong agonist itself (granted it does have some MAOI properties.). So In theory, people with dopamine dysfunction would notice  benefits.</p>

<p>It doesn’t give you a burst of dopamine per se, but it makes it easier to ask your brain for it </p>

<p>It’s definitely hard to take too many days off stimulant meds if you need them…my life starts falling apart without them. </p>

<p>I’m really hoping to take them as little as possible during the cycle…but my job is cognitively demanding and requires good people skills like yours.</p>

<p>From what I read though, you should still be able to get benefits from it, even if you do take a therapeutic dose.</p>

<p>It’s hard to keep it under my tongue, but I’m desperate….tired of feeling like garbage …I dilute it with a pine pollen tincture in a glycerin base….luckily no loss of taste (yet?) or burns (yet?).  </p>

<p>Last cycle I did was oral and I noticed nothing…not even photosensitivity, a common side effect.</p>

<p>But yeah keep us posted here, I’m definitely planning a future post to share results with everyone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh so i started my new cycle today. got a pretty good dosing method now i think.</p>

<p>i do 1ml sublingually for 3 minutes, three times in a row. </p>

<p>i chase each dose with soda. it was actually super easy. i could keep 1ml in my mouth without tasting it or having it touch my gums and teeth, then kicking it back with soda makes it hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>i’m excited to do a whole cycle dosing sublingually. i ordered 60ml this time around to give me more than enough to finish a solid cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice little plan…how much mg are in 1 ml?  I’ve never used the solution before…..it actually sounds like a good idea.   </p>

<p>I Just ordered more powder , the site I use didn’t have a solution unfortunately, otherwise I would have tried some.</p>

<p>Let us know if that’s long enough holding it too….Ive been doing 20 minutes now.  I’m noticing even more, but it’s probably because I’m later in the cycle.</p>

<p>But wow I’m really impressed with this molecule….just ten days ago I felt like garbage.  </p>

<p>Now I’m feeling somewhat back to normal…not high , not Manic, not stimulated….just normal….doing things I need to do isn’t so daunting.  Libido is slowly returning too.</p>

<p>Would love to hear what kind of results you get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh hell yeah brother! sounds like you and i are two peas in a pod. last time i did this cycle, i think day 7 was the one where it really hit me. it definitely compounds over time.</p>

<p>totally personal question but have you noticed it makes orgasms super weak? haha i’m too early in this cycle to see if that was really the case for me but last time i took 9-Me-BC, my libido did start returning pretty well but my orgasms were like, barely anything, so i barely even got to enjoy it with my lady hah.</p>

<p>i have the solution from science.bio</p>

<p>1ml = 10mg</p>

<p>i can’t imagine the liquid needs to dissolve as long as the powder does so hopefully my 3 minutes of each mini dose is enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure bro, how long you planning to do your cycle?  I’m going at least 30 days, hopefully 40…,but I heard it eventually has diminishing returns</p>

<p>Have you been able to stay off meds?  I’ve been mega dosing caffeine, it helps, but still been a struggle….luckily work is slower now.</p>

<p>I was only on day 3 the last time I had sex, and I hadn’t felt much from the 9-me-bc yet.  My sex drive was horrendously low, and my orgasms had been weak because of that (even before the 9-me-bc.) Libido starting to come back a bit though.  I’ll see my girl soon, and report back on the orgasms.</p>

<p>Also not taking stimulant meds is making sex wayyy less intense, so there’s that factor too.  Sex on Amphetamines or even Methylphenidate is savage…..most women love being ravaged like that IME</p>

<p>Interesting point about liquid dissolving faster, never thought of that</p>

<p>I just ordered from science.bio too…they’re def the best source, a bad synthesis of 9-me-bc can be toxic… when I ordered the solution wasn’t loading, but now it is again….oh well guess I’ll stay consistent with the powder.  They have a good Black Friday sale every year too, so check that out if you need to stock up on anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they seem to have a 20% off sale every week, hah. i actually literally just missed the last one by two days when i ordered this round but they also lowered the standard price from $60 to $40 so that was nice.</p>

<p>i’m only on day 2 of my current cycle so staying off meds is fine so far. today is going to be slow at work, tomorrow i’m off, and i stupidly volunteered to cover on friday but it’s likely going to be dead too.</p>

<p>i won’t really struggle with needing to take meds til monday so i guess i’ll have to see what happens. mondays are unruly at work for me.</p>

<p>i have 600mg so that’s roughly a 20 day cycle. i feel like from every report i’ve read, 14-30 days is an ideal cycle and anything beyond that is negligible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>even for the tincture solution? after like 3-4 minutes it feels like it’s almost entirely gone already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’ve taken 2g of Agmatine daily for a while, i’d wager to say it’s safe.</p>

<p>i actually only recently got into Kratom myself. it used to never do anything to me but i think i was just taking too small a dose. once I did like 3g of White Vein, i saw the mood and energy boost immediately and then spent like two weeks taking it after my lunch break to power me through the afternoon.</p>

<p>i decided i didn’t want to rely on yet another substance to get me through my day so I just quit it cold turkey and i was actually pretty tired and edgy for a week after but i didn’t attribute it to any kind of Kratom withdrawals til i spent some time in that subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah agmatine seems safe….I increased my dose to 750-1,000 mg 4 x a day.  </p>

<p>Yup takes about 3 grams to notice anything from Kratom.  Low doses like that, especially white vein, can be energizing, but more so in a mood boosting way, than a stimulating way.</p>

<p>I used Kratom to get sober , had horrible PAWS and anhedonia, plus severe depression over how much I ruined my life.  It seemed safe and side effect free (Magnesium Citrate every night cured any constipation.)</p>

<p>I quickly was up to over 100 grams per day, a ridiculously high dosage.</p>

<p>I was so depressed at the time, that I didn’t realize it was crashing my testosterone.  </p>

<p>It wasn’t until life got better I stopped to question why I still felt like garbage….had my testosterone tested it was terrible….then had prolactin checked and it was elevated.  I discovered Kratom could cause that, cut back, and the Testosterone significantly improved (despite still taking up to 40 grams per day)</p>

<p>Recently my ADHD meds began causing more side effects than benefits and fell into Anhedonia, which caused me to increase the Kratom again, and testosterone crashed again.</p>

<p>So now I’m hoping the 9-me-bc can break this vicious cycle.  Kratom cravings were <em>significantly</em> lower around day 8 of the cycle.</p>

<p>In theory you could responsibly use low doses of Kratom…kind of like you can responsibly have 1-2 drinks at happy hour every day….still not ideal though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything. Especially the Adderall thing. I use Vyvanse; but, if I use it while using 9-ME-BC it seems to not do much at all. If you get it; I&#39;d recommend the powder and go the sublingual route. The dropper tastes horrible. I couldn&#39;t stand it lol. Just make sure to leave the poder Under your tongue for at least 20 min. Or you will be wasting a lot of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha🤣! Do not listen to that guy. Yes, it will help depression and partially acts as an antagonist on KOR. But, then you&#39;re addicted to an opiate and then after withdrawal your KOR will be significantly down-regulated. The ONLY substance that shows efficiency and actually antagonises KOR is called Norbinaltorphimine (Nor-BNI). I literally just researched this for the same reasons as you and this was the only efficacious compound that just antagonises KOR and it does it pretty effectively. There is a nasal spray; but, the only supplier is sold out. So, I just ordered a vial. You just have to inject it sub q ONCE a MONTH. Be safe, it is a research chemical. But, the only compound that does what it&#39;s supposed to do; effectively too. It&#39;s supposed to be &quot;well tolerated&quot;; but, just be cautious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good choice;). I literally just cold turkey stopped taking 20mg Suboxone 3 months ago. As it caused anhedonia and made me really irritable and jacked up my stomach. Fyi, that was probably the worst opioid withdrawal I&#39;ve been through. I reached full withdrawal on the 19th day! I used Kratom and loperamide. I dropped the Kratom; but, am still on low dose loperamide and cimetidine. I&#39;ve tried using ultra low dose naltrexone; but, was sent into precipitated withdrawal every time😡. So, nor-BNI it is😂</p>

<p>I used 40cc’s in an insulin syringe to keep the dose within reason (based on doses used in animal studies), then simply administered it in the belly region as you would with insulin.</p>

<p>NorBNI supposedly inactivates the kappa receptor for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When i saw NorBNI listed as a “nootropic” on pglchem, i thought that was outrageous, as there have been 0 studies done on human beings (i mean literally ZERO).</p>

<p>Taking it was by far the hugest gamble i’ve ever taken with supposed ‘nootropics’, but to my fortune the theory turned out to be correct:
Studies suggest that the Kappa Opioid receptor is essentially an anti-nootropic. By purely stopping this receptor, whilst leaving everything else untouched, should therefore (in theory) remove this barrier.
And from what i noticed, it does indeed work, although the effects tended to be subtle, but that could be attributable to the minimal dose i used as i wasn’t going to risk a larger dose of a substance that no human being on planet earth has ever tried.</p>

<p>NorBNI doesn’t just block them; it irreversibly inactivates them (i assume it would take a good 2-3 weeks after last dose for the body to replenish them). And i can personally assert that it has zero addictive properties, unlike other Kappa blockers like Buprenorphine which also function as very minor heroin alternatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have had no such luck. i feel like i’m always surrounded by people that love ketamine but every time i try it, i hate the high, and i can’t really dial in any specific benefit to my mood or anything after.</p>

<p>i’ve been using Agmatine and that seems to have a decent compounding mood effect for me without the slow dizzy high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the experience. I don&#39;t consider the high to be positive at all personally.</p>

<p>For me, I think the main effect that i find life altering is it takes me out of hypervigilence if only for awhile. </p>

<p>I am not taking that much in my opinion. I have had no visuals, it is absolutely the best anti depressant. Strangely my SI has increased recently but I think thats life circumstances</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you link some research,  I tried to dive into this topic before and did not make a lot of headway.</p>

<p>You can mix Naltrexone in a tincture bottle to make Low or Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone.  Add a little citric acid as a preservative and/or keep it in the fridge.</p>

<p>Salvia Divinorum is nice as regular leaf, you could just smoke small bowls in a water pipe with a bong and torch.  Just mentioning that as the extracts used to be marketed heavily when the regular leaf was completely sufficient.</p>

<p>I actually started a subreddit and posted a couple studies but never got back to it r/LDNScience/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked into Naltrexone?</p>

<p>You wouldn’t need to dose it at 50 mg - the dose used in Opioid Use Disorder and Alcoholism. It’s a triple antagonist. </p>

<p>Look into Low Dose Naltrexone or even Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone. If you have a single 50 mg tablet, you can make your own solution and be good for a long time.</p>

<p>I was on Naltrexone and the injected version Vivitrol for OUD. I found it pretty handy for certain supplements like Lions Mane and Matrine, which have some Kappa agonism which causes dysphoria. Naltrexone would prevent that which was an odd benefit.</p>

<p>Be careful with naltrexone though. If you use Kratom or Tianeptine, you will precipitate if you’re dependent and it will block them. Also, it can be stressful on your liver if you have impaired liver function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naltrexone is going to be the cheapest. You could experiment with salvia in low/high doses to see if there’s some reverse action or desensitization at the receptor. Kappa opioid agonists are experimental and expensive and might not even work. I had dpdr too and what helped the most was taking mdma with a friend and talking through some sexual trauma I had. Trauma therapy, lamictal, various basic supplements and friends r the best ways to get out of the trauma fog. Also discussing your fear response to dissociation with a therapist. There’s not a magic pill that can fix you, your brain is obviously stuck on something.</p>
