        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am Long Covid for more than 2 years. My symptoms are extreme fatigue, PEM, food intolerances.</p>

<p>I am about to try Bromantane, but I am extreme sensitive to any medication or supplement since long covid. 
I&#39;m afraid to take new drugs that can have  long-term side effects. For example, I took SSRI only 2 weeks and had 1 months of horrible side effects after stopping it. I took an antiretroviral, it was too strong for me, I needed to stop after 1 month and had 2 weeks of vertigo after stopping it. But the worst thing was monoxidil. I used it 5 days and I had 8 months of nightmare, the biggest crisis of my Long Covid.</p>

<p>I did not see any bad reaction to Bromantane, but I am wondering if someone had long term side effects ? </p>

<p>I really want to improve my daily life because I am housebound, but I want to be sure that something is safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bupropion is a dopamine meme drug. Its mostly noradrenergic and even has melanocortin receptor activation which can have horrible side effects for some people <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023989/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023989/</a></p>

<p>MC4 receptor activation can create for example anhedonia, actually lower dopamine. </p>

<p>Bromantane avoids NE and no melanocortin action. Its a true dopamine nootropic. Also has some GABAergic effects </p>

<p>I can’t tolerate caffeine due to problems with it blunting my emotions but I actually was able to tolerate Bromantane and it helps me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a crisis with headaches and very anxious. I decided to start wellbutrin. For 1 months, my anxiety, hedaches, depression was at the maximum. To be honest, i am not someone who is depressed normally, but this time was horrible.</p>

<p>I decided to continue and I felt a bit better after that.
But I don’t like to take drugs and was afraid to continue it. I took wellbutrin for almost 4 months. 
The withdrawal was horrible… maybe i should have continued because 3/4 months was not enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Withdrawal was what I had before taking bupropion, during my crisis. I don’t know if it was low dopamine symptoms, but I felt very tired and without no reason, my energy disappeared in one second at any moment of the day. For example, i walked 2 minutes, and my vital energy disappeared. It was hard to speak, think, etc.
I have this when I am in PEM normally but the whole day and I know the cause, but this time, it was random</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just saying this sounds like a return of baseline not a wd. I’ve been on and off the max dose of bupropion and the wd of there is one is a day or two. It’s not horrible but bupropion leaves your system relatively quick. Also generic which is what bupropion is has been proven to not be as effective as name brand. It doesn’t keep a consistent in your blood like the og oill design. I’ll edit with a reference but name brand Wellbutrin and frenetic work the same but one works the other sends bursts of it to your body which = unfucking comfortable. </p>

<p>I’ve stopped it cold turkey every time and never had more then a two day reset but everyone is different I just think it sounds like the side effects way out weighted the fact that it was helping and when you stopped went back to baseline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend PQQ+Ubuiquinol however 20mg PQQ each day in the morning before breakfast or empty stomach and each day walk and walk. Say you have extreme fatigue, but try to do 1000 steps outside today if you can. Tomorrow, go again 1000 steps, could seem little but that is besides the point. WHEN it really starts to feel easy 1000 steps, listen your body and go for more, go 2000 steps. But don&#39;t let your mind dictate the rythm, let your body say. The key is to learn how to listen your body and not your brain so to speak. Do 2000 steps each day for a period, could be few days or weeks, do it. At some point you will feel that you&#39;d rather walk 3000 steps and you feel quite fine and that you could do 5000 steps too, but wait, don&#39;t get ahead of yourself, keep the limit steady each day. In this format, increase the amount, it can take weks or months, however consistency accelerates the rate while incosistency makes the whole thing not work as it should and any conclusion drawn is flawed. You need to spend energy to make energy, however our emotions and low will power from fatigue and even low dopamine baseline can make us rather stay sedentary. With Bromantane and guarding your dopamine spikes strategically, you can start this. I would even recommend you add Shilajit with 30 minutes before your walks and some B vitamins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is a useful copy pasta:</p>

<p><em>Tip 4 PQQ</em></p>

<p><em>PQQ stands for pyrroloquinoline quinone. PQQ stimulates the creation of new mitochondria within the brain itself. Mitochondria are the “energy factories” of a cell. The brain contains a lot of mitochondria. By creating new mitochondria within the brain, energy production is increased, which creates more clarity of thought and more mental energy [10]. PQQ also has a protective function within the brain [11]. It is sometimes even seen as an essential brain nutrient, within some specific scientific literature [12]. Furthermore, PQQ also lowers inflammatory processes [13]. Inflammation can be seen as an important contributing factor that creates autoimmune diseases, heart disease and also negatively influences the aging process. Hence, PQQ doesn’t only increase your mental performance but has great benefits in the areas of anti-aging and general health.</em></p>

<p><em>Even as a student, I use PQQ together with some form of CoQ10 year round. CoQ10 is a substance that increases the absorption of PQQ (Unfair Advantage has a premium form of CoQ10). Even though I have a limited budget, I still think it is valuable to take PQQ, because PQQ increases productivity, give you more energy, makes sleep more efficient and gives more mental clarity. The costs for PQQ can be “recovered” by the increase in productivity.</em></p>

<p><em>The price for Unfair Advantage might seem expensive, but it pays off. The bottom line is that PQQ, and especially Unfair Advantage, will help you make the best of every day. This calculation only took into account the effects that PQQ has on sleep efficiency and quality and assumed PQQ didn’t have any other effects. As mentioned before, PQQ has many other different effects that improve our lives. In conclusion, the net contributions that PQQ can have to our lives are hard to overestimate.</em></p>

<p><em>Most important reason for supplementation: Focus, memory, general well-being and anti-aging.</em></p>

<p><em>Recommended dosage: Take PQQ on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, as prescribed on the package. For example, use one mini-shot of Unfair Advantage, or use another PQQ supplement. If you choose to use another supplement than Unfair Advantage, make sure you choose a BioPQQ form of PQQ. BioPQQ absorbs better than other PQQ forms (but absorb to a lesser extent than Unfair Advantage). For the best results and absorption, combine BioPQQ with a CoQ10 supplement.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I also personally have to add and also saw anecdotes but is little known about PQQ, is that it can really take away brain fog; now maybe cause of brain fog depends, though in me it took it just like that and left me speechless since and pleasently surprised :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q10/ubiquinol is good with food sure, well even PQQ i wouldn&#39;t overthink it, especially if you have 2 in 1 formula and just take it with a meal. PQQ if you have as single ingredient, take before a meal on empty stomach, it should not give problems even if u have IBS or gastritis etc. from my research i find that is better to take it on empty stomach however some take it with. </p>

<p>honestly i for one take it without and with food, depends. if i do intermitent fasting then I take it without food but if i would eat something in the morning i would some days take the pqq before eating and other days just take it with the meal, in the long run it helps.</p>

<p>PQQ is purported to improve mitochondrial function and more stuff, for some it could even regulate their sleep patterns (assuming they don&#39;t blast blue light in their face). But remember, for PQQ to really work you need to exercise as well, exercise can also mean walking for 1-2 hours, so don&#39;t imagine exercise means intense advanced cardio 2 hours sweat and die program. Of course, if you do such intense exercise it can help pqq work even better. just listen to your body</p>

<p>But 20mg of PQQ on an empty stomach?</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ve got a stomach of steel, but that shit is like a nuclear bomb on an empty stomach. Soooo much pain and nausea. Happens to my wife too. </p>

<p>I&#39;d definitely suggest taking it with food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes pqq and coq10 are good for youre mitochondria. But if you can get real mots-c or ss-31 peptides, they really boost youre mitochondria. Did 10 days of mots-c and could really feel it. But my biggest problem is my gut at the moment and that is hindering the rest of my Recovery, but its getting better slowly. Will do the mots-c again when me gut and digestion is back to normal so i can sustain my bodys needs. </p>

<p>And about the bromantane, i am currently on day 2 (done it before and did helped that time so thought about giving it another try) together with 9 mbc. And can already notice a real difference in  sharpness of the mind and less fatigue.</p>

<p>And about the walking thats a good great advise, especially after you had some food. Walk as far as what feels good and slowly progres that day by day</p>

<p><em>Tip 4 PQQ</em></p>

<p><em>PQQ stands for pyrroloquinoline quinone. PQQ stimulates the creation of new mitochondria within the brain itself. Mitochondria are the “energy factories” of a cell. The brain contains a lot of mitochondria. By creating new mitochondria within the brain, energy production is increased, which creates more clarity of thought and more mental energy [10]. PQQ also has a protective function within the brain [11]. It is sometimes even seen as an essential brain nutrient, within some specific scientific literature [12]. Furthermore, PQQ also lowers inflammatory processes [13]. Inflammation can be seen as an important contributing factor that creates autoimmune diseases, heart disease and also negatively influences the aging process. Hence, PQQ doesn’t only increase your mental performance but has great benefits in the areas of anti-aging and general health.</em></p>

<p><em>Even as a student, I use PQQ together with some form of CoQ10 year round. CoQ10 is a substance that increases the absorption of PQQ (Unfair Advantage has a premium form of CoQ10). Even though I have a limited budget, I still think it is valuable to take PQQ, because PQQ increases productivity, give you more energy, makes sleep more efficient and gives more mental clarity. The costs for PQQ can be “recovered” by the increase in productivity.</em></p>

<p><em>The price for Unfair Advantage might seem expensive, but it pays off. The bottom line is that PQQ, and especially Unfair Advantage, will help you make the best of every day. This calculation only took into account the effects that PQQ has on sleep efficiency and quality and assumed PQQ didn’t have any other effects. As mentioned before, PQQ has many other different effects that improve our lives. In conclusion, the net contributions that PQQ can have to our lives are hard to overestimate.</em></p>

<p><em>Most important reason for supplementation: Focus, memory, general well-being and anti-aging.</em></p>

<p><em>Recommended dosage: Take PQQ on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning, as prescribed on the package. For example, use one mini-shot of Unfair Advantage, or use another PQQ supplement. If you choose to use another supplement than Unfair Advantage, make sure you choose a BioPQQ form of PQQ. BioPQQ absorbs better than other PQQ forms (but absorb to a lesser extent than Unfair Advantage). For the best results and absorption, combine BioPQQ with a CoQ10 supplement.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q10/ubiquinol is good with food sure, well even PQQ i wouldn&#39;t overthink it, especially if you have 2 in 1 formula and just take it with a meal. PQQ if you have as single ingredient, take before a meal on empty stomach, it should not give problems even if u have IBS or gastritis etc. from my research i find that is better to take it on empty stomach however some take it with. </p>

<p>honestly i for one take it without and with food, depends. if i do intermitent fasting then I take it without food but if i would eat something in the morning i would some days take the pqq before eating and other days just take it with the meal, in the long run it helps.</p>

<p>PQQ is purported to improve mitochondrial function and more stuff, for some it could even regulate their sleep patterns (assuming they don&#39;t blast blue light in their face). But remember, for PQQ to really work you need to exercise as well, exercise can also mean walking for 1-2 hours, so don&#39;t imagine exercise means intense advanced cardio 2 hours sweat and die program. Of course, if you do such intense exercise it can help pqq work even better. just listen to your body</p>
