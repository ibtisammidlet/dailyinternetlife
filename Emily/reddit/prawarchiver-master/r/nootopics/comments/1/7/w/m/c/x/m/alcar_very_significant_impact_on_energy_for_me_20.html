        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi All,  </p>

<p>I have been experimenting with nootropics for over 20 years.   My first was piracetam, which opened up all of the other racetams until I found that Phenylpiracetam was the &quot;best&quot; for me.   I used RALA, Fish Oil, every vitamin and mineral, choline, 5-HTP, Tryptophan, St Johns, DL Phenyl, Kava, Kratom, CBD, Selegiline, methylphenidate, agmatine, NAC, PQQ,  etc - it goes on and on.<br/>
At the same time (when I was 20-25) I experimented with ALCAR and found that it gave me way  too much nervous energy and anxiety at almost any dose.   Now that I&#39;m 38, the anxiety aspect is much lower  and ALCAR consistently gives me very hightened energy.  I have taken it off and on for 20 years and it is one of the very few supplements which I take note of each time and say &quot;Ah, this one is  a keeper, it makes a huge difference in  my day to day life&quot;.  </p>

<p>For me, I find that it is best when I cycle it, after a while I seem to get more of the agitation from ALCAR and less of the energy.  After a few days off I&#39;m good again.   It is also somewhat inconsistent, and some days it doesn&#39;t seem to work at all.  It has a negative effect on my sleep cycle and worsens insomnia (the biggest downside).  </p>

<p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>High physical and mental energy (can feel a bit manic)</li>
<li>High focus</li>
<li>Increased performance in the gym</li>
<li>Increased motivation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sleep onset... seems to have a negative impact on sleep that is persistent no matter how long I take it.  I have energy into the evening which prevents sleep onset.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Combinations:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Bromantane seems to combine very well for focus and drive</li>
<li>PQQ - while COQ10 doesn&#39;t have any noticeable effect PQQ does noticeably raise my energy as well<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>About me: I am 38 now, Recently I learned that I have CMT-1a, which affects nerve insulation and growth - specifically peripheral nerves.   It&#39;s degenerative like MS.   ALCAR is listed as a potential adjunctive therapy  (without significant evidence).    </p>

<p>Can anyone help me understand why ALCAR specifically has such a powerful effect on my body?  </p>

<p>Does anyone know (based on how ALCAR works) how I can improve sleep while taking it?  Is there something which can blunt the effect only temporarily in the evening?</p>

Sweet spot is 500-1000mg in the  AM MOST days.  Though sometimes I wish I had taken more.  It&#39;s better to take less than I think I  need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man. I have started using ALCAR too at 500mg daily. People usually report all kinds of positives when you can hardly be sure to relate it to that x supplement. ALCAR also gives me noticeable effect, almost like a Ritalin effect with less stimulation. </p>

<p>The day I don‚Äôt take it, I see the difference. I don‚Äôt know why specifically it affects some of us more than others. It intervenes in the metabolism of fats and acetylcholine production (cognition) in the mitochondria (energy factory in the cell). </p>

<p>The only problem is that anything that usually ends up working meets its end after a while. So I‚Äôm not sure how long this will last and what is the true impact on my body after a short to long term use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is it. The increased acetylcholine keeps me wide awake. Sadly it‚Äôs not a manageable issue for me. I‚Äôve tried ALCAR off and on over the years and the mental boost is always offset by the unsustainable insomnia. I sleep perfectly fine otherwise. I‚Äôve tried a range of dosages and either it‚Äôs too low for any effect or I‚Äôm wide awake all night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that doesn&#39;t give me much hope haha...   I&#39;m half way an insomniac anyway and alcar doesn&#39;t help.   But, sadly, I feel like I really need to find how i can incorporate it into my day to day.</p>

<p>I will try using it with Piracetam or something else which depletes aCh.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I guess any short lived anticholingergic drug might help with sleep onset?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry i am of no help because I keep getting a crash from Alcar, and since we are discussing alcar i want to share my short experience with it. Yeah, I get those benefits, but somehow it messes with my blood sugar. At first i suspected it was messing with my thyroid, but reaction happens so fast even after a long break, about 5 hours after taking it. I see bigger positive effect when combining it with carbs (dry fruit in my case), but bigger crash too hence why i zeroed in on blood sugar flactuations, almost like some form of hypoglycemia. Should I give it a try with chromium or other insulin modulators, or would they make issue worse? Any tips?</p>
