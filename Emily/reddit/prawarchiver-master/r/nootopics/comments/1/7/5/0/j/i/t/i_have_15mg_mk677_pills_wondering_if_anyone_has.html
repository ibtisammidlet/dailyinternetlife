        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just curious about expierence and positives and negatives of personal use. The SARMS community couldn’t help with this question so much lol.</p>

<p>I took it for a few days but scared but I was also stacking LGD4003 with it. It was odd as I have never been into PEDS at all. But I felt pretty good on the MK.</p>

<p>Anyway anything would be cool and helpful. I don’t think stacking all of those would be wise either just saying what I am currently taking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MK plus LGD means a ton of water weight, bloat, and potentially high blood pressure. MK is a dirty GH secretagogue compared to the others. You get prolonged prolactin and cortisol release; so it is best to take upon waking. You should take something like berberine with MK because MK reduces insulin sensitivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mk677 can increase anxiety in some people. Ghrelin mimetic act on the same pathway as fear in your brain. With that said it’s cheap to use for a gh boost but be careful of high blood sugar. I used it several time and I end up putting too much fat. Nowadays I use it sparingly,like twice a week, on my hardest workout to recover a bit faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this explains quite a bit. I took it for three days with the sarm and was having ungodly panic attacks but also really calm at night. I figured I had tanked my test as I had just got off suboxone on to sublacade which already does that. But none the less I think I’ll skip it and just toss the pills. For ever one positive report I read I find about 100 negative ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mk677 is sloppy. Massive hunger increases, lethargy, lots of water retention, and wrecks insulin sensitivity compared to the equivalent amount of GH response from rHGH or the cleaner peptides. I’d only use it if 1 you are an extremely lean hardgainer that cannot eat enough calories. Ipamorelin +CJC 2-3x a day or just use real rHGH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have strong tongkat extract. I’m worried about the side effects of the mk. I tried it for a few days last year and I remember I had some bad anxiety but I was also taking lgd so. Idk maybe I’ll try it PED are very interesting to me I also haves cardarine. That one scares me though hahaha.</p>
