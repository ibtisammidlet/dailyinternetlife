        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Summary: Need help finding the most effective/ highest probability of relieving anhedonia and autism/adhd if possible however anhedonia is the most problematic.
Risks is less important im basically ok with any risks almost anyways but im not su1cidal yet(sry for being a crybaby) i just NEED to stark functioning asap.</p>

<p>Did have ritalin and after that vyvanse, latter worked awesome obviously but it triggers my addiction when it wears of, and i start to feel like crap again </p>

<p>Im 26yo sober amphetamine/opioid addict on buprenorfine. </p>

<p>I have ADHD(extremely inattentive) and probably autism(looking into that rn with psychologist)</p>

<p>I just want to feel ok, i have had anxiety since age 10 at least and depression since 13. Especially anhedonia which is by far the worst of my symptoms, and the reason i fell hard for amphetamine.</p>

<p>Tried like close to 100 nootropics among them semax, selank, bromantane(not for long enough i relapsed and lost it somewhere sadly) </p>

<p>Only one that i felt working was nsi-189 but it was in a very bad way. I had lots of neck and back pain and anxiety got worse. Could this have been a sign i should have kept going?</p>

<p>Also pdychadelics was amazing both low dose  and micro, last micro dose got me interested in meditation which has saved my life in a way, wouldnt be sober now without it.</p>

<p>Other diagnoses:
Body dysmorphia
GAD
social anxiety
Panic anxiety
Have had what might be hypomanic episodes, before addiction started, however nothing much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to use an irreversible MAOI or Armodafanil. They’re the only things that are comparable to amphetamines. Both will last longer.</p>

<p>MAOI is likely better for GAD but is subject to blood pressure changes. Take a look at the MAOI subreddit and Dr. Gillmans website. He is a decent source of info on MAOIs and has resources to help actually get a prescription as it can be difficult.</p>

<p>Nsi-189 response seems somewhat typical apart from the pain. I agree with your decision to stop.</p>

<p>Would also consider looking at basic health and nutritional markers via blood testing. See if you can find anything off, try fixing it and see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries.</p>

<p>Lamotrigine has shown efficacy in autism.</p>

<p>MAOIs are hard to get anywhere. Use the Dr. Gillman letter from his website. Send it to your doctor. </p>

<p>Nardil is the better choice.</p>

<p>9-me-bc has not been studied sufficiently to know if its safe for long term use. It shows promise for changing dopamine receptor sensitivity but this may not be a desirable change for long term brain health as you would be cranking up oxidative stress if your using stimulants alongside it to treat ADHD. </p>

<p>Its a weak MAOI compared to Parnate and Nardil, and comes with some other side effects like light sensitivity which we don’t know much about. How will this effect our eyes over the long run? Many unanswered questions.</p>

<p>In short, try lamotrigine if you struggle with main autism symptoms, then try get a prescription for Nardil. I don’t recommend self medicating with something like Autism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggled with anhedonia for 8 years. What I discovered fixed it was testosterone. Like injecting testosterone. I went to the gym and took testosterone to put on muscle and I was damn surprised how all the emotional numbness disappeared, way more out going, enjoy people, enjoy life, actually attracted to women again. I now permanently inject testosterone in low doses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting because there is decent research showing anhedonia is strongly associated with low testosterone. Nothing else has even come close to working like testosterone did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok thanks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on it two years. I&#39;m just afraid to get off of it because it&#39;s literally the only thing that has helped major depression. I just finished TMS and that did nothing. I dropped down to 2mg awhile back but depression crept back in to where I just stayed in bed as much as possible so I went back up in dosage. Depression threatens my sobriety so it just seems safest to stay on it for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s completely reasonable. One thing I will say is that during the two years you’ve been on it your brain has been massively up-regulating dopamine receptors. If you did stop you might discover that due to this up-regulation your brain is no longer depressed. But I completely understand the decision to stay on it to maintain your sobriety. It’s always a balance and there’s never a “perfect” solution. You’re probably not going to like this solution since you have addiction concerns but I found benzodiazepines super helpful when I was on it to push through the anhedonia. Benzos really gave me back a little spark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s the thing, I went down to 2mg and was severely depressed so went back up.
My doctor won&#39;t prescribe me benzos. Not sure I&#39;d want to use them again even if he would except for if I were to completely get off buprenorphine. The first time I got off of it anxiety was SO bad! He still wouldn&#39;t prescribe them. I do take pregabalin though. I actually just tapered off of it two weeks ago then couldn&#39;t figure out why I was so incredibly tired and unmotivated all day everyday. One day it hit me it was probably having stopped the lyrica so I took one and the tiredness and lack of motivation vanished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s really good that the lyrica helps with tiredness and motivation. I hope you can keep tweaking things and find a solution. Modafinil might be helpful. Anhedonia is the WORST. When it hits me, for various reasons, I have absolutely zero energy, zero motivation, zero enjoyment. I can’t laugh or enjoy anything including music.

Doctors don&#39;t seem to take it seriously or believe that SSRIs and whatever else can cause it. When enough people complain about it hopefully it&#39;ll bring about change and help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a similar mental health situation as you and nootropics haven&#39;t done anything significant for me no matter how many I tried, or how much money I spent, or how intentionally I tried to target dopaminergic function, etc. I can&#39;t speak for everyone but I just don&#39;t think they&#39;re strong enough for moderate to severe depression or anhedonia. Amphetamine (Vyvanse) lead to the most significant remission by far but I really didn&#39;t like the idea of having to make a stimulant have to do so much heavy lifting where depression and anhedonia are concerned. If it were purely ADHD/motivational issues then the relatively short duration/coverage wouldn&#39;t have been such an issue, but the daily cycle or rollercoaster of beginning the day in a really low mood, feeling better with the pill kicking in, and possibly a bit of a crash later on, began to get pretty exhausting and worrying despite the significant benefits.</p>

<p>It looks like I&#39;ll be trying Parnate in the future and I&#39;m hoping that will address the weaknesses or downsides of stimulant medication for these conditions but I apparently have months wait in an unmedicated state to get into seeing my psychiatrist to begin the process, so it feels pretty hard to maintain optimism for a prospective medication, even though at this moment this medication seems to be my best bet of the things I haven&#39;t tried yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I was you, I would stop looking at things that manipulate your brain, and instead focus on your overall health. People forget the brain operates within the human body. This means that if you blood sugar is really low, you&#39;ll get anhedonia that won&#39;t be fixed by any drug, only proper nutrition will help. Similarly, if one of your hormones like testosterone or cortisol are out of whack, you might get anhedonia that will only be fixed by normalizing those levels. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is try to go down that avenue, try to not just diagnose your brain itself, but your body as a whole and how it can be affecting your brain ls function. </p>

<p>You&#39;d be amazed how many people&#39;s mental health issues are entirely fueled by overall health issues. People who separate mind and body tend to take much longer to figure out why their brains aren&#39;t working properly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anhedonia is real tricky and I don’t think the conventional approach pharma or nootropics wise is the right answer. 
Take a look at this: <a href="https://youtu.be/vJ8b-DoKYAU?si=cqeqtjNO9iLjG7ux">https://youtu.be/vJ8b-DoKYAU?si=cqeqtjNO9iLjG7ux</a>
I don’t endorse the exact protocol (though it worked well for me) but the approach is fundamentally centered around sensitization rather than modulation or cramming in as much catelochomines as possible (I love MAOIs and stims don’t get me wrong). 
To me that’s really how to fix the root cause of the issue rather than covering it up with more dopaminergics, but that’s easier said than done. 
Anhedonia = numbness, blunted feelings. Restore sensitivity = relieve anhedonia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selegiline my friend. It works wonders for me, do your research on it to but it&#39;s an MaoBi in lower doses (5-10mg) and a MaoB/Ai in doses 15mg and above. It practically cured my anhedonic depression. Just be careful with your tyramine intake as too much while on an MaoAi can lead to a hypertensive crisis. Also don&#39;t take any stimulants while on it either, I wouldn&#39;t even take in caffeine while on it. It&#39;s typically dosed bucally for anhedonia and depression but I found best results with oral dosing. YMMV. Good luck!!</p>

However, I also actually notice increased emotions from stimulants, and same for MAOIs. I&#39;d say just give it a try and if it blunts your emotions too much and doesn&#39;t go away with time, then stop taking it. I hope it all goes well for you if you do decide to try it though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anxiety is the underlying cause that triggered all of the other conditions. You have to treat the anxiety and the other issues will resolve with time. Do not cover up your issues with drugs and nootropics, they are not the answer for problems this severe, they are just a way to enhance a life that is already in harmony. I would a combination of therapy (if you can’t afford it or get insurance to cover it, start with learning basic therapy concepts from youtube therapists like Therapy
 In A Nutshell), meditation, brain training/hypnotherapy and an exercise program (preferably yoga). If you can really commit to changing your life and healing, it’s well within your reach.</p>
