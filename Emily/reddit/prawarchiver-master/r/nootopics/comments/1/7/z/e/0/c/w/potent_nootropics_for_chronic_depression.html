        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dear community!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I battle with chronic depression since more than a decade now and I have just discovered the realm of nootropics. I want to ask you, who are more experienced, to give me some guidance and tell me which substances and protocols might be worth trying!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So this is my case:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I am depressed since about 2011. This is characterized by:</p>

<p>- Low modd</p>

<p>- Anhedonia</p>

<p>- Lack of motivation and lots of procrastination</p>

<p>- Constant feeling of overwhelm and weakness</p>

<p>- Social aversion and social anxiety</p>

<p>- Hard time getting up in the morning</p>

<p>- Day time sleepiness</p>

<p>- Brain fog, bad concentration</p>

<p>- Memory issues, especially short term memory -  these got significantly worse since I don&#39;t take SSRIs and SNRIs any more</p>

<p>- Word finding problems</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>These symptoms give me a hard time at work. At the moment I try to cover up my bad work performance with unpaid extra hours, but this is a vicious circle, leading to more stress, even less concentration and even more extra hours I have to spend to keep up with my schedule…</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Apart from that I have some chronic physical symptoms that might be related somehow:</p>

<p>- Hashimoto (Antibodies and inflammation detectable but normal hormone levels)</p>

<p>- Pancreatic insufficiency which expresses itself in fatty stools</p>

<p>- Insensitive fingertips and low finger dexterity</p>

<p>- Hands falling asleep frequently</p>

<p>- Light tinnitus</p>

<p>- Chronic nasal congestion, poor sense of smell</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no clear reason for my depression. It started in my late 20ies short before graduating from university. I drank alcohol regularily at that time but not excessively. I didn&#39;t smoke weed at that time, but I smoked it regularily from my late teens to my mid 20ies. I didn&#39;t do any other drugs. There were no traumatic things happening prior to onset.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have been on all kinds of psych meds so far, most of them had rather strong side effects, which made me refrain from them . At the moment I don&#39;t take any subscription medication. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>These are the meds I got subscribed so far and the side-effects they gave me:</p>

<p>- Sertralin:  restlessness and jittering</p>

<p>- Quetiapin: made me extremely tired for 12h and more</p>

<p>- Venlafaxin+Abilify: restlessmess, bad concentration, low libido, UV sensitivity</p>

<p>- Venlafaxin + Wellbutrin: no records left</p>

<p>- Venlafaxin alone: improved mood, cognition and motivation, restlessness, excessive sweating</p>

<p>- Duloxetin:  improved mood, cognition and motivation, indifference, low emotions</p>

<p>- Milnacipran:  like Duloxetin</p>

<p>- Brintellix: No effect at all</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have had several different psychotherapists from different thought schools, none of these therapies improved my wellbeing.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started to take a non-medical approach using nutrition and supplements. I quit drinking alcohol, I only buy organic food and I follow a ketogenic diet (high fat, low carb) mostly consisting of fish, meat, olives, cheese, butter, nut butters and salad. I started the ketogenic diet one month ago and according to the urine tests strips I have been in ketosis every day since. I don&#39;t feel much effect from it t, except for my sense of smell which seems to have improved a little bit. I also started a whole-body-hyperthermia protocoll a month ago that includes elongated Sauna-Sessions 1x per week, but without noticeable effect so far.  I also tried microdosing Psilocybin, which didn&#39;t improve my mood or cognition, but seemingly makes it easier to access my feelings (aka crying), so i keep taking a microsode every time before going to therapy.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Apart from that I am experimenting around with lots of different supplements. At the moment I take an awful lot of supplements, which comes from the bad habit to buy new supplements before using up the previous ones… </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>At the moment I take the following supplements:</p>

<p>- Betaine and pepsine - to improve protein digestion</p>

<p>- Pancreatine - to improve fat digestion</p>

<p>- Electrolytes:  to support hydration in the ketogenic diet</p>

<p>- MCT oil: 1 tea spoon to enhance ketone levels</p>

<p>- Taurine 1g - for improved fat burning to support the ketogenic diet</p>

<p>- Glutamine 5g: for gut health</p>

<p>- Acacia powder (Gummi arabicum): 1 table spoon for gut health</p>

<p>- Vitamin D3 +K2: for mood and immune system</p>

<p>- Cod liver oil - 1 table spoon - (~1500 mg DHA, 1000mg EPA) for  mood and cognition</p>

<p>- Acetyl-L-Carnitin: 2x 500mg - for  mood and cognition</p>

<p>- Creatine Monohydrate 1x5g: for cognition</p>

<p>- Huperzine A: 1x 250mcg: for cognition</p>

<p>- Hericium 2x 650mg - for cognition</p>

<p>- Cordyceps: 2x 500mg - for energy</p>

<p>- L-Tyrosin 500 mg- for improved dopamine levels</p>

<p>- N-Acetyl-L-Cystein (NAC): 1x 800mg  - for detoxofocation</p>

<p>- Vitamin B Complex - for cognition and detoxification</p>

<p>- Ashwaganda: 1x200mg for sleep</p>

<p>- Magnesium: L-Threonat: 1x 1000mg for sleep</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And I take the following suplements sproadically:</p>

<p>- Tumeric powder</p>

<p>- Spirulina powder</p>

<p>- Vitamine C+ zinc</p>

<p>- Maca Powder</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Despite using some of the supplements since more than a year now (Omega 3, ALC, Vit D, Tumeric, Magnesium) I didn&#39;t notice any positive changes since starting with it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The next ones that I want to try are:</p>

<p>- Spermidin</p>

<p>- Rhodiola Rosea</p>

<p>- Alpha GPC</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t expect much from these either</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Since all these attempts didn&#39;t get me much further, I want to take my efforts to the next level with some more potent substances - but I really don&#39;t know in which direction to look! Is there anything you could recommend me?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, they ban alright... I have been banned without warning and publically belittled by the moderators at r/Nootropics just for mentioning Sirsadalot and Bromantane. All that, then for me to ask in the private mod chat why they banned me for mentioning Sirsadalot, JUST for them to continue belittling me there as well and then muting me says A LOT, lol.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see there are a good few people from this subreddit that were banned from r/Nootropics for similar nonsense reasons without warning, including the creator of this subreddit himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly different in the sense where there was no warning over a nonsensical issue, in regards to your previous bit in your original message where warnings were mentioned.</p>

<p>Yeah, account age could be the reason since OP said it was instant. But the automoderator taking your post down and warning you for your account age or karma versus getting subreddit banned are pretty different, lol.</p>

<p>Whatever this is, this is unwarranted and the r/Nootropics moderators are at fault until they help OP... It&#39;s just the moderators there don&#39;t have a good track record sadly. Hopefully that changes though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try emoxypine, after 10 years researching nootropics, this is by far my Nr1</p>

<p>Just search on reddit for Reports, all are very positive, because it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>My other recommendation is Agmatin sulfate, sam-e or St Johns wort.</p>

<p>If this stuff still does not work, try a therapeutic dose of ketamine.</p>

<p>For all those recommendations exits scientific studys about it, that they really working for depression or anxiety.</p>

<p>And if it&#39;s really testosterone related then try tong kat Ali from ND. It&#39;s one of the best natural testosterone booster.</p>

<p>I suffer also 10 years+ from depression, and those things were at least for me helpful, because they really worked.</p>

<p>I tried also every pharma antidepressants that exists here in Europe, without any success.</p>

<p>Exercise especially running would also tremendously improve your mental health. Try to get stable with a med/substance and then focus on exercise when you have enough energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the recommendations.</p>

<p>I put emoxypine on my bucket list.</p>

<p>Agmatin sulfate and St John wort maybe... But I have already tried so much of the less potent stuff, that I want to focus on the more potent stuff now.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been taking SAMe for some months but stopped it, since it is rather expensive and didn&#39;t do a thing. I also did running - 4 months in a row every day, it gave me a short high afterwards but the rest of the day I would still feel down. Sports is on my bucket list, but this time I will rather focus on weight training. At the moment I am just so overworked and down, that I can&#39;t find the time and motivation to get up and so it.</p>

<p>Ketamine is also on my radar, but since I am in Europe where it is not as widespread as in the US, I don&#39;t have many options. There is one clinic that offers it, but only for severe cases and only together with a 4 week inpatient stay. At the moment I can&#39;t afford to stay from work away for so long</p>

<p>I already tried it, ketamine is the strongest antidepressant that I ever tried. The day after my brain felt like new born. But the effects lasts only short.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I have very very similar symptoms lately….my life is fine too.</p>

<p>Just getting out of bed takes enormous Will power, as does simple Tasks like making breakfast, laundry, etc.  Life feels unbearable some days, and for no reason</p>

<p>I started using Kratom to manage the symptoms, but it made things much worse….while it provided short term relief, regular use caused high prolactin and low testosterone, so made things worse long term.  </p>

<p>I started 9-me-bc , on day 9 now, and yesterday I noticed something very unusual….I got out of bed no problem.  Made breakfast no problem.  Did things I was supposed to be doing all day without needing enormous Will power.  Kratom dosage cut in half.  </p>

<p>I don’t feel high.  I don’t feel stimulated.  Nor manic.  I just feel….normal.  Like I’m back to life.  Life is interesting again (as it should be)</p>

<p>I’ve been taking 30 mg Sublingual for 15-20 min …this is a bit difficult as it really burns….but I’m so desperate to feel better I didn’t care .  This is significantly more effective than oral IME (tried same dose oral before, noticed nothing after three weeks)</p>

<p>Dreams have been very bizzare.  There’s photosensitivity which is why I waited until the winter to take it.</p>

<p>I’ve been a regular prescription stimulant user too, so my dopamine may have burnt out….9-me-bc seems to restore the functioning and tone of dopamine, without directly releasing much like an agonist (although it does have some MAOI activity, which could cause a direct increase in dopamine, serotonin, etc but it doesn’t feel super strong)</p>

<p>I’ve spent well over $3,000 on nootropics and this has been by far the most effective….this is actually what I was expecting from Nootropics all along </p>

<p>Going to do a full post soon.</p>

<p>I’m Trying to take a break from the meds to really let things repair…. heard when you do take stimulants again they’ll hit you pretty hard.  (Unfortunately my ADHD is too severe, so I’ll probably be back on them soon )</p>

<p>I’ve read some people take their prescribed doses while on 9-me-bc and still get results though…just be careful with the MAOI + stimulant combo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’ve used Bromantane too…it was much milder than 9-me-bc IME, but it did have some benefits…Bromantane looks safer and more studied as well.</p>

<p>Tbf I never completed a full 30 day cycle of Bromantane…I used to get this odd side effect which is probably TMI. (If you really want to know you can ask though)</p>

<p>Will try Bromantane again in the future though.</p>

<p>9-me bc <em>seems</em> more effective for <em>repairing</em> and restoring deeper dopamine damage ( e.g. Heavy stimulant use). </p>

<p>They both up regulate Tyrosine Hydroxylase….hard to say which does it more, although from my research it <em>seems</em> Bromantane does a better job of this.</p>

<p>Hard to say if Bromantane actually repairs significant damage (e.g. prolonged stimulant use/abuse) to the same level as 9-me-bc, but bromantane does restore some dopamine function.</p>

<p>I wish there were more side to side comparisons….seems like Bromantane may be better for just regular cognitive / dopamine enhancement, while 9-me-bc is for deeper damage / anhedonia….Im just speculating here though, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong or share your opinion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was taking 60-70 grams per day of Kratom, which is incredibly high.</p>

<p>On day 8 of the 9-me-bc cycle I noticed I got out of bed easy and without Kratom….my craving for it was significantly reduced.  I cut my morning dose in half and felt fine.  Normally I feel awful and anxious when cutting my dose that much.</p>

<p>Currently down to about 30 grams per day….still a bad habit, but a huge improvement….kinda like cutting down from two packs of cigarettes a day to one…still bad, but much better.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is I’m doing fine on just 30 GPD….last time I tried such a big cut it was unbearable and I couldn’t function, could barely move.</p>

<p>I buy the powder 9-me-bc (not the capsule.). I weigh out 30 mg on a powder plate, then pull my tongue back, and dump the powder into the crevice.  It’s a bit tricky because the powder can stick to the plate.  You gotta really tap it good, and make sure it goes under your tongue (it’s difficult to move it back under your tongue if you miss it.) </p>

<p>Also try to swallow any saliva before dumping the powder….the longer you hold it the more saliva accumulates.  Eventually it’s like a pool, and it gets harder and harder to hold it the more saliva accumulates.  So clear out any Saliva first.</p>

<p>The first batch burned pretty bad, and was mildly numbing.  The second batch burns mildly, no numbing.  I’m not sure if that’s a sign the second batch is weaker, or if it’s just more pure….or maybe I’m getting used to it.</p>

<p>Vivid dreams too.  Photosensitivity even though it’s late November….lips are burnt from being outside the other day (even with SPF chapstick.). Some people report loss of taste.  Otherwise no side effects I’m aware of…potential toxicity if you get a bad batch or take too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow congrats on getting down to 30 gpd from 80 that&#39;s a huge deal!! Thanks for the info. I quit Suboxone after 14 years (and was on oxy for a few years previously) with Kratom and take 5 gpd but my serotonin and dopamine are trashed and like you and OP I have a hard time doing anything and it definitely doesn&#39;t help that I work from home and don&#39;t really have to work but I miss having a drive and creativity. I used to have all sorts of ideas and start projects and businesses (not that I <em>finished</em> a lot but still). I also took Adderall for years and quit when I quit Suboxone but lately have been taking a little again but really don&#39;t want to...but the lethargy has been too much. I&#39;m super curious about 9-me-bc, I tried Kana a few times and it was suggested to put it in a piece of paper towels or toilet paper and then put it under your tongue (until it dissolves but not actually swallowing the paper). Do you think you could do that with it? Thanks for the info!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank You, and congrats on quitting Suboxone!  That must be even harder than Kratom….Id imagine suboxone tanks your testosterone and libido even worse too.</p>

<p>I really hope I can stay at this 30 GPD, or even get lower…,the only thing is the 9-me-bc magic will eventually wear off, and I’m worried I might slip again unless I do another cycle.</p>

<p>Last March I got down to 35-40 GPD and my testosterone improved a lot.</p>

<p>Soon I’ll need to go back on my ADHD meds too….while 9-me-bc helps me get out of bed and do basic tasks, it doesn’t help with more complex stuff, time management, or my job (work is slow now though)</p>

<p>Yes totally hear ya on all the projects and ideas….lately my biggest goal and concern is seeking comfort, which is antithetical to my natural personality of adventure and ambition.  I hate it.  My old self would be disgusted with my current self.</p>

<p>Zero creativity, except a brief burst when I use Cannabis….but no energy, motivation, or confidence to act on it.  </p>

<p>I’ve never heard of that with the paper.  I have no idea if that would work or not with 9-me-bc….but it’s expensive, and I don’t want to risk wasting it….but if I couldn’t tolerate it I’d def consider that.</p>

<p>Zyn pouches are wrapped in paper and they definitely work, so I could see how that would possibly, if not probably, work.</p>

<p>If after 7-12 Days of that there’s no difference I’d say it’s not working though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The polygala and 4&#39;-DMA should ideally be taken together. Polygala is a decent herbal mood booster on its own, but there&#39;s also evidence it prevents potential TrkB downregulation from 4&#39;-DMA.</p>

<p>I&#39;d start with bromantane on its own probably, but Semax and/or Selank are commonly stacked. The 4&#39;-DMA combo is a little less common, but it helps me. Unfortunately it&#39;s also fairly pricey from ND.</p>

<p>Of these, bromantane and Semax seem to have the best anecdotal evidence. Possibly a good starting point.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t mention it originally, but many swear by Cerebrolysin. Haven&#39;t tried it myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a nootropic but look into getting tested for mold. Did you move or start a new job in 2011 that could have exposed you? Mold illness can cause all of these symptoms, including Hashimotos.
Also be cautious with Lions Mane and Ashwgandha. They can cause anhedonia in themselves. Not everyone is sensitive to them but seeing as you have had reactions to SSRIs I would just be more cautious. It&#39;s possible you have a genetic reason for not detoxifying medications and toxins well. 
This is a lot of supplements, I would make absolutely certain you&#39;re getting good quality third party tested supplements and try to narrow these down.
As others have stated, get your hormones checked. Would suggest working with a functional medicine practitioner who can help get to the root cause of what&#39;s going on and help guide you in narrowing these supplements down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for extending the range of possible causes . I have excluded mold as a primary cause since I was living at my parents house when the whole shit started, which was a massive house in a very good condition, and moved 3 times in between with no change in symptoms. </p>

<p>I use Lion&#39;s mane and Ashwagande since a few months with no apparent positive or negative effect, but thanks for the warnings, might just remove them from my stack since I am overstacked anyways...</p>

<p>I still refrained from seeing doctors that go beyond standard procedures, since these are not covered by health insurance and things get very expensive very quickly. That&#39;s how the system here works. The doctor either has a contract with a health insurance, then he only does standards examinations that are covered by insurance or he has a private practice, then he can do pretty much everything but you will have to pay for everything in full. Don&#39;t have much money to put into that game, but hey, since cryptos go up again - maybe in the near future? ;-D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend taking tryptophan at night - aside from helping with sleep, it will raise your serotonin levels. </p>

<p>Taking fish oil is also strongly recommended for depression - I keep mine in the fridge, and put only 4 days of the pills into my pill case, to prevent it from going rancid. Look for brands that filter out heavy metals and ideally have 3rd party testing to ensure this.</p>

<p>Rhodiola is good, though in some people it can worsen anxiety - for many it’s great for depression so long as they don’t take too high of a dose. Herbalists recommend taking a break from it every few months (though I’m not sure how long). I recommend Gaia Herbs.</p>

<p>Have you ever been tested for the MTHFR genetic mutation? It causes mental health problems and trouble absorbing B vitamins, but is very easily treated by taking active or methylated B vitamins. If you have it, it’s recommended to avoid regular folic acid since it would block the pathways, preventing you from absorbing the methylated folate used to treat it. (Sometimes bread/wheat is fortified with it, at least in the US)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get a sleep study, apnea can definitely cause morning (and all day even) fatigue and depression even if the only risk factor you have is congestion. </p>

<p>As for psych meds, try Wellbutrin alone or I think in Europe they have reboxetine which might be helpful. We have atomoxetine here which is pretty similar (both primarily NRIs)… they cause anxiety and restlessness at first but once your body adjusts they can be calming and very helpful for ADHD symptoms. After that maybe try getting prescribed MAOIs but get off EVERYTHING if you do—drug-drug interactions are no joke with those. Modafinil also definitely worth a shot if you can get it prescribed.</p>

<p>I think you mentioned Lions Mane somewhere, make sure you get a good extract from fruiting bodies like Real Mushrooms or ND. A good turmeric extract is also important—Longvida is the best I’ve found for cognition, Meriva is great for inflammation.</p>

<p>From what I’ve seen mentioned I’d prioritize 4’-dma-7,8-dhf (very nice for mood and focus and quite a few of the things you mentioned). Unfortunately you’ll have to order from the US since I think only ND has it. Polygala extract from them is also worth a try but has less pronounced effects, good one to take on days you don’t take 4’-dma. Agmatine should be available to you in Europe and is also worth a shot, it may not be as mild as you think. Semax for cognition and Selank for mood and anxiety are also pretty good options if those are more easily available. I personally don’t think kratom is a good fit for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MAOIs require special consideration which is why they’re generally not prescribed as first line options. Drug interactions can be deadly but more commonly they just cause unwanted side effects. They also primarily address mood and anxiety (which they’re great for if you have atypical depression) but don’t do much for cognition… NRIs can be great for cognition (almost but not quite as good as traditional stimulants) and have a unique calming effect from adrenergic downregulation. They also have side effects but more manageable than MAOIs. Also you seem to do well with SNRIs like duloxetine—the indifference and low emotions are likely from the SRI part of that.</p>

<p>I think everything would be fine stacked (minus the MAOIs) but I personally would be cautious stacking 4’-dma and Semax or lions mane… 4’-dma is the most stimulating of those three (more like caffeine than amphetamine) and can keep you up if you don’t take it close to when you wake up. It would probably be fine but might cause anxiety stacked with Semax especially. I think anything that increases attention and motivation will lead to overstimulation if you take too much or combine it with others like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, </p>

<p>I was severely depressed and anxious with suicidal tendencies for three to four months. </p>

<p>This what I do on a daily basis:</p>

<p>Two hours incline walk (two sessions). 
Listen to David Goggins. </p>

<p>I take: </p>

<p>NAC 1800 mg
L-tyrosine occasionally
Caffeine 200 mg 
B-complex methylated 
Shilajit occasionally 
D3 5000 iu with k2 400 iu
Rhodiola Rosea 450 mg
L-theanine 500 mg
Ashwaganda 600 mg (occasionally 900 mg)((incredible for lowering anxiety))
Magnesiumglycinate (800 mg elemental) 
Astaxanthin 12 mg occasionally
Boron 9 mg occasionally 
Zinc 75 mg occasionally 
EPA 2000 mg
Creatine 5 g
BCAA 7.5 g
Collagen 15 mg 
Lidl protein shake 3x/day
Mineral complex 
Iodine </p>

<p>Looking to add Bacopa Monnieri and Citicoline. </p>

<p>I focus on taking good care of myself by getting ripped. I focus on relationships with genuine good-hearted people. I focus on helping my friends with whatever I can. I focus on being calm and in the present. I focus on realizing that life will throw challenges your way and the only thing you can do is to never let yourself give up. </p>

<p>PS: I have tinnitus too due to an asshole who made a loud noise next to me. Four months in, this just serves as extra motivation to conquer my goals. Not letting anything stand in my way. </p>

<p>Strength to you.</p>

A whole host of things can trigger it.  I like Lions mane for focal clarity and Reishi for energy and immune support.  I do the tinctures.
My degree is Psychology, few understand the chemical impact of these drugs and fewer still can guess why you are off.  Food clarity, feet to earth grounding, take out the trash in your body with mushrooms, and test all your hormones but start slow with these.  Look up cellular inflammation and uptake inhibition.  Vitamins C in graduating larger doses get good quality vitamins - I like fermented ones.</p>

If the typical pharmaceutical antidepressants don&#39;t work, try something like Bromantane + Rhodiola + DLPA.

    <div class="md"><p>It probably worked off the mark but I was so busy with life that I didn&#39;t notice until after 2 months. These things don&#39;t work in the typical drug fashion where you feel the high straight away. They build up in your system gradually until you look back and realise they&#39;ve had an actual effect. To answer the second part of your question, I&#39;m not as consistent with it these days. There are times when I don&#39;t take them for weeks and the effects are still there. I may come off just to see if the depression comes back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would narrow down the number of supps you&#39;re currently taking, just so that you know what&#39;s doing what -- might be a few too many variables in there.  Personally I would concentrate on the inflammation aspect of depression + the neurogenesis theory of antidepressants + the dopamine axis. So likely you&#39;d be looking at something like:  </p>

<p>- a dopamine agonist like Macuna Pruriens or Wellbutrin<br/>
- a heavy-duty anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant like Astaxanthin (12mg)<br/>
- something like Lion&#39;s Mane or Noopept for neurogenesis<br/>
- a Choline + Inositol supp as a nootropic adjunctive therapy  </p>

<p>In any case, always read up on all the things you&#39;re taking and be aware of any interactions. A bit of light reading below. Good luck on the journey, friend.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you guys for all your comments! </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I want to make a short wrapup of the recommendations so far:</p>

<p>The most mentioned substances were:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 mentions: Cerebrolysin  / P21 / Cortexin (4 mentions)</li>
<li>3 mentions: Kratom,  high dose Psilocybin, Semax / Selank , 4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF / Eutropoflavin , polygala tenuifolia, Modafinil</li>
<li>2 mentions: dopamine agonists (Macuna Pruriens, Wellbutrin, Revoxetine), Agmatin sulfate, Ketamin, MAOIs, Lion&#39;s Mane, ST John&#39;s Wort</li>
<li>1 mention: 9-me-bc, Emoxypine / Mexidol, Bromantane, Memantine, Astaxanthin, Choline + Inositol, SAMe, Tumeric, Saffron</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on these substances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cerebrolysin  and Cortexin are available in Europe and seem to be very save, and from what I understood it is more like a vitamin and doesn&#39;t change your brain chemistry, so I am inclined to start with one of these substances...</li>
<li>Semax / Selank: Similar case. They are available and seem to be very safe. Also something that I could start with...</li>
<li>Psilocybin is something on the bucket list, I want to do a high dose ceremony with a professional tripsitter in the new year. I want to avoid to go on any prescribed medication like Wellbutrin or an MAOI until then, since it is not recommended to do psilocybin on psych meds and trip sitters are reluctant to work with people who are on psych meds. Are there any other compounds I should be careful with when doing psilocybin?</li>
<li>Kratom is not an option for me, I am far too scared of the addiction potential.</li>
<li>Ketamin seems more like an emergency medication than a long term solution to me, so it is nothing I would start with, since I am interested in long term relief....</li>
<li>4&#39;-DMA-7,8-DHF / Eutropoflavin: Couldn&#39;t find any bad reviews on it and seems to fit my symptoms, so sounds interesting to me</li>
<li>9-me-bc: Sounds very interesting to me, since I&#39;ve read so many outstanding user reports on it. But seems to be unexplored and risky.</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t find the time to research on the other substances yet...</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Recommendations to do outside the realm of nootropics:</p>

<ul>
<li>test for hormones levels (thyroid, testosterone) (4x)</li>
<li>reuce supplements in general (3x)</li>
<li>remove Ashwaganda from protocol (2x) remove lion&#39;s mane from protocol (1)</li>
<li>test for Sleep apnea (2x)</li>
<li>test for Mold exposure (2x)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my thoughts on these suggestions: I&#39;m definitely going to see an otolaryngologist for my sinus issues, check if there is a mold infection, and check if there can be anything done to improve my breathing, even surgery, if necessary. I&#39;m also going to look for a private doctor who does hormone checks. I guess that I will need to find a private practitioner, since this is most likely not covered by insurance. I&#39;m also going to cut out Ashwaganda from my supplementation protocol.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Any thoughts or recommendations?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my opinions (dont ask me for sources im making everything up)</p>

<p>* kratom is shit, yes</p>

<p>* ketamine is pointless</p>

<p>* psilocybin is neat, but SRIs will probably make it not work (just a note)</p>

<p>* 9 me bc is stupid</p>

<p>* those things are mostly not dopamine agonists (cba to check which ones are)</p>

<p>* st johns wort is stupid</p>

<p>* MAOIs can be helpful but they have their issues. still better than SSRIs/SNRIs i think</p>

<p>* memantine is stupid</p>

<p>* bromantane is good</p>

<p>* modafinil is meh</p>

<p>Huperzine can probably go too unless it actually helped you. The three things you were going to add probably wont do anything.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Attend a Landmark Forum Weekend. It&#39;s been online now since COVID, however in person is still the best.</p></li>
<li><p>Try a therapeutic dose of psilocybin (3.5g) in a safe familiar setting.  While listening to Imperial Colleges psychedelic playlist.  Allow the music to bring up thoughts and use the distinctions from landmark to help navigate through them. If possible have a good friend be with you and be willing to listen especially as you come off and start integrating back to reality.</p></li>

At the moment I am not even eager to find a different facilitator, since I have a new theory of where my depression might come from. I made a bioresonance treatment (I know that this is whoowhoo, but what do I have to lose?) And tested positive for Borna virus. Borna virus would explain my symptoms perfectly. Now I am trying to find a doctor who would make a blood test, to verify this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering this sub I have some controversial advice. Your story sounds very familiar. I suffered the same symptoms for around 10 years, and still do to some extent. But now I know how to recover. </p>

<p>In my case it turned out I was just exhausted from constant anxiety over my performance, about being liked etc. As you say, you end up in a vicious cycle. Anyways, like you, I was always looking for a solution in external stuff: try new supplements, exercise more, socialize more, or whatever Google told me might be wrong. In the end, I crashed and discovered that all I needed was... rest. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re just tired. Stop searching for &quot;the solution&quot; and give yourself a break if you can. All of the symptoms you list are likely caused by chronic stress and just sheer exhaustion. Take 1-3 naps of 10-20 minutes a day, this will help build your energy reserve back up. Be kind to yourself, watch yourself for negative self-talk, and allow whatever comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone had recommended <a href="https://www.bravermantest.com/">the Braverman Test</a> as a good resource to roughly assess which neurotransmitters a person may be dominant &amp; deficient in - which also comes with suggestions for supplements &amp; dosages for one’s corresponding results;</p>

<p>Basic theory would often state depression corresponding to serotonin issues - though might be worthwhile taking a few minutes to do that test and look through your results, as there might be some additional insight there along with custom-tailored suggestions.</p>

<p>(Also, this is by no means “advice” or a recommendation, though there’s been alot of promising research on ketamine as being a HIGHLY effectively treatment for depression - not something to do on your own, but may be worth looking into what’s unfolding in that world in professional settings with trained therapists.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For how many years did you have that amalgam? Heavy metal toxicity is often very hard to identify when it comes to it&#39;s surface that&#39;s why you go by symptoms. In your case this amalgam might be enough to poison your brain with mercury, find dentist who uses proper safety standards when removing like IOAMT - this is very important!</p>

<p>After removing you can start detoxing from heavy metals, you can PM me for guidance. </p>

<p>Regarding adrenal fatigue, it&#39;s completely ignored by mainstream medicine, I guess all you can do is to make cortisol level test. I know it&#39;s real because I have it and it&#39;s symptoms can be reduced by taking hydrocortisone. It might be difficult to get prescription for that stuff though.</p>

<p>You can do few things now for start, it&#39;s quite simple to check by yourself if you really have adrenal fatigue: buy Adrenal Cortex, made by Thorne and start like this: take one capsule as the first thing in the morning, observe what happens. If nothing happens then next day take two capsules, you can increase the dosage safely (in the past I&#39;ve been taking like 5 capsules a day). Let me know how it went. More info how it works below, this supplement is commonly known as ACE because in the past Thorne used to call it Adrenal Cortex Extract or something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>KRATOM all day. 1000%. It’s the leaf of a tree and smoke everything else. Better than any drug, better than any nootropic for depression, Anhedonia, and motivation. Man it’s such a literal life saver, and it’s super cheap if you use the right vendor. </p>

<p>The vendor I get from has $55 kilos (1000 grams), and most companies charge literally 5-20x that. It’s ridiculous. Higher price doesn’t = higher quality with kratom. All IS vendors order it fromIndonesia and aurroundong areas for $18-25 per kilo, then JACK the price up because they slapped their company label on it. Total BS.</p>

<p>Kratom is the biggest game changer you can ever use. If you take too much for too long, you’ll have WD synptoms similar to mild opioid WD’s, so just rapid taper off when you want to quit. That’s the only downside. You can get 10 years of feeling great out of it, and if you want to quit, rapid taper off over 1 month, it’s painless. Then you’re back where you were at before.</p>

And the WD’s aren’t as bad unless you’re taking 40-50 grams daily which is a crap ton. Low doses are the best, like 2-4 grams. Idk I’m just throwing that out there, and it’s $55 for a whole Kilo and is cheap. I prefer kratom over regular mu-opioid agonists any day, eapecially for anti depressant effects (with lower doses), and for pain relief/anti inflammatory effects (higher doses).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there can easily be contaminants in kratom since it&#39;s grown in soil, unlike synthetic opioids which are produced in a lab. The differential nature of each batch also tends to make the effects of a given dose rather inconsistent. </p>

<p>I see success with any opioid though, and can confirm that the endogenous opioid system is the main problem behind depression. Take care of dopamine on top of it, as with a stimulant, and you&#39;re golden. </p>

<p>This is because opioids dictate social attachment drive, and a dearth of social attachment (particularly social loss), can and will cause depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah for sure I agree. Personally, fl-Modafinil along with kratom or any opioid is amazing for motivation, depression, and stress. Or a Modafinil/Benzo or Modafinil/alcohol combo. I don’t usually recommend that but it works amazingly. I’d rather use Flmodafinil or Fladrafinil than traditional atoms personally, but to each is their own. That’s just what always works for me. Flmodafinil + Phenibut + kratom/opioids + alcohol = god mode for me. But I don’t recommend it to others because that’s quite a lot to be taking all the time lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Combining alcohol with phenibut is unnecessary imo, since they&#39;re both GABAergic. As for modafinil, I dislike how norepinephrine-loaded it is, and prefer more dopaminergic stimulants. </p>

<p>I also don&#39;t feel a need for phenibut on an opioid/stim combo, and would only do it if I have particular social expectations that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be a chickenshit. If you&#39;re afraid of taking risks, then how will you ever overcome your problems?</p>

<p>When I started my nootropic journey, in retrospect I wish I had just begun with phenibut and kratom instead of wasting my time with other things out of fear of &quot;muh addiction.&quot;</p>

<p>I have had no issues with getting off of either even after having used them rather excessively. I learned how to control tolerance to opioid agonists and make them managable for low dose, daily use, and now take phenibut only sparingly and consider 500mg optimal.</p>
