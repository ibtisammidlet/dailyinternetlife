        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m finally finding a stack that works for me, but looking to find the final piece that will boost my energy a bit more. For context, 54F diagnosed with OSA, depression, anxiety, and general fatigue (which I equate wirh my depression.) I am a little overweight and get no exercise, but hoping to start working out again when I can feel some energy. For prescription I take Zoloft 150mg, Modafinil 100mg, and am also on Sublocade low dose for prior substance abuse. I am also prescribed Gabapentin 600mg/3x/day which is quite beneficial when I take all at once instead for energy, hence I run out pretty quickly of, and I know that&#39;s not how it&#39;s prescribed! What I&#39;m looking for is to stop the Gabapentin and replace with something more beneficial and less addictive. For noots I take 2000mg NAC, 2000mg Sarcosine, and 200mg polygala daily in the AM. this combo has helped my depression and anxiety 10fold. Wondering if adding Sabroxy or Kanna, or something more stimulating would be my final piece? Any thoughts on those or something else that might be more like a Gabapentin feeling if there is such a thing? Again, I want to replace the Gabapentin, not continue with it. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get energy from expending it, that&#39;s the secret. The more energy you spend, the more you have. When you&#39;re low, it feels difficult but trust the journey and progress. I would recommend you add 20mg PQQ each morning as well and experiment with Shilajit for bursts of energy (not stimulant) to use when you want to exercise. Remember that walking is also exercising and you can really help your body a lot. If you feel bored to walk just listen to a podcast or audiobook while you do, whatever it takes you to build momentum. If you can get endorphins from an activity each day especially in the morning, it will really really help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PQQ may be helpful itself for gabaergic withdrawals, when glutamate storms come into play which also damage your nervous system too. Hangover thing. </p>

<p>PQQ is said to be very protective against excicotoxcicity. </p>

<p>Then another aspect was that D-serine neurotransmitter was said to be anti-addictive, anti-anxiety and so on, also via regulation of glutamate / NMDA-system. New thing bit difficult to find sanely priced, but PQQ what is also very neurogenetic and energizing via mitochondrial boost was said also to enhance its binding what may be already something since this D-serine is endogenous neurotransmitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on a similar combination, Suboxone instead of Sublocade. </p>

<p>For me, I found the problem to be NAC. It induces anhedonia for me bad, and it dulls stimulants significantly for me so modafinil, sabroxy, amphetamine… etc. were not helping at all. </p>

<p>Also, I found Polygala best to be removed when trying to diagnose the problem. It has some weird effects at times and it’s hard to gauge what is the issue.</p>

<p>Gabapentin is really mild especially at such a low dose that you’re on, but it would be helpful to get off of it as well. I suggest Agmatine Sulfate to help with tapering, as well as Bromantane, maybe fasoracetam (I haven’t had conclusive results with it), and maybe Beta Alanine to help with anxiety from stopping it (maybe, it helps a lot with Phenibut). I’ve never had Gabapentin WD even from high dosages for prolonged periods of time, but I have experienced Phenibut WD.</p>

<p>Agmatine itself has its own set of effects and may make you feel different. Many say it helps them with depression and anhedonia.</p>

<p>Also, do this supervised with you psychiatrist or primary care physician but I really hate Zoloft and all SSRIs/SNRIs. I’d come off if I was you, but I am not you and you just do what’s best and what your doctor recommends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What dosage of Bromantane would you suggest? Tried Agmatine and it gave me the world&#39;s worst gas and bloating for 2 months so I switched to the sarcosine which was much better. I Definitely want off Gabapentin. When I take it, I way overuse , and although I love the effects, I do experience pretty severe wd because of the overuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I would recommend the nasal spray from Everychem. That ROA is by far the best and most noticeable in my experience, and it would seem the community shares that opinion as well. </p>

<p>I would start with 2 sprays. Wait 15-30 minutes. And gauge from there. I’ve comfortably used 8-12 sprays, twice a day before.</p>

<p>I would use up to 8-12 sprays because it was recommended to me by another intelligent user ( <a href="/u/Hxmusa">/u/Hxmusa</a> )in this sub in a post where I asked if it reduces phenibut’s effects. He suggested using a high dose during the initial phase of phenibut discontinuation. I gave it a try and found it helped a lot with sluggishness, mood, motivation, and anxiety during the acute stage. </p>

<p>Also, in my experience along with others Bromantane dulls/diminishes the euphoric/recreational effects of both Phenibut and Gabapentin significantly. I find this is helpful because you’re less prone to mega dosing, compulsive redosing, at least I was. </p>

<p>Also, it will increase dopamine and help repair your dopaminergic system the process. See <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> post regarding this. </p>

<p>I also wasn’t a fan of Agmatine. It made me feel weird. I only use it to when quitting phenibut. I tried it also to see if it would potentate my Suboxone in anyway, it did not.</p>

<p>But I really really reeeallly suggest dropping the NAC. Give yourself 7-10 days for all of it to get out and see if it helps with the depression, lethargy, and anhedonia. It changed my life around personally. I now only use 600 mg NAC maybe 1-2x a week as mostly a tool to either prevent myself from continuing a stimulant binge (due to its dulling effect), to help reduce some cravings or compulsive behavior I may be experiencing at the time. 2000 mg is way to high too. I’ve done the same as you 1200-2400 mg a day of NAC. Less is more, but none is best for me :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turn the tip that’s facing down upward. It rotates. Shake before use, and spray it in your nose. The first few pumps may not produce any spray but it will come.</p>

<p>It’s oily so I suggest lying down and tilting your head back after spraying to avoid it leaking out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bromantane made everything else super effective in the long run.  2 sessions.  One at 10 weeks ago?  and one at 6 weeks ago.  3 days each session, 5-10mg IN of just the powder, once per day in the session.  I may be an outlier but it has been super effective for me.  Caffeine now feels like amphetamines.  Cannabis is more euphoric.  I had to cut back caffeine intake by about 50% or more.  Depression crushed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes seriously. 6 total doses.  I was pretty jacked up the last few weeks and it is slowly leveling out. I dont take any other supplements so I cant tell you how it interacts with anything other than cannabis/caffeine.  But it has made both those much more effective.  I am not kidding when I say a cup of coffee now gets me absolutely skeeted.  I will say I am pretty sure it has made me more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine because I now get caffeine headaches the following day really easily if I overdo it on the previous day.</p>

<p>Differs from people to people, and long term effect so one has to test it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Effects are all very individual. I did not find Faso a big deal for cognitive enchancement, and sometimes advertised as anti-ADHD thing that is not true as it was only for some highly special subtype of that what is around only 10% cases.

<p>Faso may actually block the effect of GABA-B agonists such as Baclofen or Phenibut so dont mix like many people do, but then when taken when not on influence said to lower the tolerance which of course then means lower addiction as well. I did not get that effect either very much, and generally all of those are bad drugs. But Faso for anyone who has not problem with those, and just want general GABA upregulation could be worth of trying. Just you need to remember that initial effect may be opposite, and wanted effect would become by time. Because Gabapentinoid mode of action is very specialized, it may be though hard to fully get out of withdrawal with other GABA stuff working differently but always it relieves somewhat and everything is needed in that state to prevent more destructive choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many potential things to add into your stack, but I would go first for quality magnesium threonate (and taurate since it contains anti-anxiety taurine what is cheap separately, and mag-glycinate what contains anti-anxiety glycine what I would or do take also separately). At least so many anecdotes here in Reddit about good impact of it, and good for addictions and generally nootropic stacks should usually begin with such micro-nutrients of which you may have some lack and most of people in western world using diuretics such as coffee with lot of sugars do have magnesium lack. Mayby the reason it has such proven impact on anxiety issues + co-factor for cellular energy production too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taurine is most underrated nootropics. It is natural endogenous neurotransmitter, so up to 50 grams you can take without ill-effects, although it does not make sense to take that much as few grams just enough. </p>

<p>Taurine is strongly neurogenetic, so may help your brain to reverse addictions long run too, and good acute effects on gabaergic anxiolysis.</p>
