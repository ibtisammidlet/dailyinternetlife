        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently started researching what creates certain pathologies in autism and trying some things. I concluded most of my issues (anxiety, sensory issues, overstimulation, sleep problems caused by the previous, etc.) largely result from nmda hypofunction which leads to too much glutamate. I’ve also found that simply taking gabaergics only “masks” the problem and doesn’t truly do anything to address the core issues. True nmda receptor antagonists such as memantine do. Memantine has by far been the most effective thing to instantly and convincingly treat the underlying anxiety that I believe fuels every other autistic problem.</p>

<p>I won’t go too much into the details of how I came to this conclusion. It was a lot of trial and error, looking at research and anecdotal experiences to pattern match, seeing if effects from certain nootropics/supps I took lined up with the theory, and modifying it as needed. Of course Im open to any criticism and might be wrong about some things or missing info, but I believe my conclusions so far have been accurate, at least for my case.</p>

<p>I don’t want to rely on just memantine though. I actually don’t know if it’s sustainable long term or how it’s half life works very well, looking to understand that more. I also want to heal my brain in other ways such as making sure to have proper glutathione, improving methylation, and perhaps in the future experimenting with micro dosing “harder” substances like psychedelics for longer lasting neuroplasticity. That being said this is the stack I came up with: 
- 10-20mg memantine every 2-3 days for nmda antagonism/regulation </p>

<ul>
<li><p>plenty of broccoli, chocolate, and curcumin for glutathione and anti oxidant</p></li>
<li><p>glutathione (not sure the dosage yet, probably 500mg) </p></li>
<li><p>l-theanine for high-stress situations where I can also use being slightly stimulated </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Other things I’m considering:
- NAC: I’ve taken this in the past, but it made me anhedonic and emotionally blunted. Im not sure if fixing other things will make this a more viable option </p>

<ul>
<li><p>bromantate: more brain  relaxing than phenibut, lavender oil, theanine… p much every other gabaergic I’ve taken. Relaxes my mind even more than kratom</p></li>
<li><p>racetams (Piracetam, noopept, and aniracetam) and cholinergics like alpha GPC: I’m still not very sure how these interact with everything else. I feel like I learn better on these but I’m afraid they might contribute to glutamate toxicity as well</p></li>
<li><p>5-htp and it’s alternatives: I know 5-tho is not sustainable long term. I’m honestly quite ignorant on how serotonin affects autism. I’ve read that autisitcs have very high levels, but taking these makes me feel more at peace, motivated, and helps me enjoy things such as talking to people and feel more emotional. </p></li>
<li><p>And finally, Yerba matte: I was trying so hard to find a substitute for caffeine and this seems promising. Would this be advisable, or perhaps there is anything better?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry if it got a bit too long. I feel like the pieces are coming together and wanted to hopefully discuss my knowledge and theories with other people. Any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to go read some review papers on what pharmaceutical drugs are being used to treat ASD in the last 1-3 years. The key here is REVIEW where they analyze a bunch of studies together examining both the study quality and any effect size. Then, extrapolate from there.</p>

<p>Some of this isn’t totally out to lunch (l-theanine) and some of it is (5htp) for someone autistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I’ve read, they still use things like anti psychotics that cause terrible sides. And just to control outward behavior like stimming (so neurotypical can like them more lol) but I haven’t seen much quality of life treatments that actually attempt to fix underlying issues. The most novel I’ve seen is using things like thc and cbd oil to help with anxiety and sleep. I’m not sure if I’m up to date with the literature, but it doesn’t seem great. They do know that there are gaba-glutamate imbalances but I don’t know what they’re prescribing up to date. Do you have anywhere to start?</p>
