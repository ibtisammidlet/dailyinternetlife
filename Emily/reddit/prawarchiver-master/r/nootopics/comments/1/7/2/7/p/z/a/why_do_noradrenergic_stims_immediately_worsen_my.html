        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They completely fuck me up and even induce it while on and afterwards. My body cannot handle the noradrenaline. I know its hard to believe but caffeine completely fucked me up.</p>

<p>I was doing better recently after a round of Rifaximin for SIBO but earlier this week I accidentally ordered a mocha that wasn’t decaf because I forgot to write that. And boom an hour later the little emotional tone I had  gets completely cut off. Days later im still suffering from this crash in my state. Its hell. </p>

<p><strong>And what is weird and seems to be a hint is that on Rifaximin I could tolerate caffeine fine like normal.</strong></p>

<p>There are only 2 exceptions: Armodafinil and Bromantane, TAK-653 if the latter 2 even count.</p>

<p>TAK653 gave me temporary remission from anhedonia twice but not again. Doesn’t do that much now. </p>

<p>Bromantane has a subtle effect that helps. Armodafinil I can actually tolerate fine, and I feel the dopamine effect which makes things more positive and some slight emotion. </p>

<p>The commonality between all of these is that  they avoid the NE pathways completely. Stuff like Ritalin or Parnate also blunts me really badly, altho it seems like I recuperated back to baseline from those in a few days while accidental caffeine this time has really done me in </p>

<p>Dopamine helps as would be expected, but NE fucks me up hard. And this is unfortunate because so many anhedonia meds touch that or serotonin, which btw also blunting for me, even worse bc it fucks up libido too.</p>

<p>GABAergics help my anhedonia, and LDN 0.5 mg has a minor positive effect. </p>

<p>I am starting to wonder what the issue is. I thought glutamate, but I tolerate Armodafinil 25 mg just fine and it actually helps my symptoms. </p>

<p>It seems to be noradrenergic stuff specifically. </p>

<p>In terms of genes, I am SS SLC6A4, COMT val/val, and a cyp2d6 2/4 so poor ish metabolizer. Also homozygous for MTHFR A1298C. Idk if any of these explain it but probably not, as I became sensitive to caffeine suddenly last year. A month after covid and a nasty alcohol hangover. </p>

<p>It is debilitating to live with this caffeine sensitivity this extreme. What kinds of tests should I do to investigate this? </p>

<p>I have had high eosinophils 0.7 (0-0.4) and low Abs CD8-CD57 lymphs of 15  (60-360). I wonder if something in my immune system is very off and what I need to investigate or try.
I plan to do the 13 cytokine panel soon. </p>

<p>Hormonally:</p>

<p>Total Chol 107 (100-199)
Pregnenolone 80 (&lt;150)
Cortisol AM 12.5 (6.2-19.4)
DHEA-S 405 (138-475)
Testosterone 614 (264-916)
E2 27 (7.6-42.6)</p>

<p>Ferritin 60 (30-400)
Vitamin D 61 (30-100)</p>

<p>Also all my symptoms are better at night. </p>

<p>Im wondering if perhaps my body is not able to mount a cortisol response to caffeine/NE stimulants for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How&#39;s your glycemic control? When I experienced something along the lines you are experiencing, I realized that my blood sugar was super low all the time. This caused my E and NE levels to be naturally high, leading to an excess if anything boosted it further. Try eating more regularly and more complex meals and see if that helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you haven’t tried Parnate for long enough. Maybe stick through with it because meds usually feel bad in beginning and then start to work later after taking consistently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would chronic Parnate potentially desensitize the adrenergic receptors in order to remove the sensitivity? Despite absolutely painful startup</p>

<p>Because the thing feels basically like what I imagine an Amphetamine feels (i have never taken Amps, but it at least felt exactly like the time I used Ritalin which is different but still). Basically acutely I got a motivation+libido boost at 5 mg but felt soo robotic blunted even while it was on, and then there was also a comedown feeling afterwards where everything would get worse. Only took it 2 days and it took 3 to get back to baseline. </p>

<p>My guess is that dopamine still helps my symptoms as expected but the NE just fucks it.</p>

<p>Also I tried Nardil 7.5 mg a week. And first 2 days it massively <em>improved</em> my anhedonia/blunting symptoms, despite causing tons of bloating. But then as the week progressed my libido zeroed and I also felt more blunted. Felt like this was from serotonergic side effects in the case of Nardil, while the initial 2 days was from GABA. But the bloating being bad also seems to indicate slower motility which is probably bad for potentially relapsing SIBO issues, don’t want that either. </p>

<p>And other GABA meds like benzos help my anhedonia as does pregabalin (though its not directly GABAergic) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on two NDRIs, and an SSRI. I do, and also before had anhedonic depression. You know what seems to be the only meds that make me feel normal? GABAergics. The one medication that would make me feel perfect? Ambien. Amphetamines do literal squat for me. Libido is nonexistent (I think that&#39;s the SSRI, Lexapro). Motivation is rare, and when I get it, it only lasts a day. Never tried pregabalin, gabapentin did nothing. But of course, what doctor on the planet would prescribe me what actually makes me feel right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and me both. I use clonidine myself, I see you use guanfacine. I can handle dexamphetamine ok until a certain point; higher doses I absolutely need clonidine.</p>

<p>Caffeine works for a ton of ADHD folks, and for me? I’m hypersensitive to it and after any dopamine wears off I crash hard and the anhedonia is always 10x worse.</p>

<p>Wellbutrin worked ok for a while, but doesn’t seem to anymore - I’ve somehow become more and more sensitive to the norepinephrine activation stuff. I hate it.</p>

<p>It’s like I get to choose between being anxious and motivated and flat affect, or less anxious unmotivated and flat affect. Sucks.</p>

<p>I’m going to follow you because apparently we have similar reactions to some of the same meds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory about why your antibiotic might have made you feel less shitty with caffeine - if you are a slow metabolizer like me, that means you’re more likely to feel like crap having caffeine at the usual doses for most people. The antibiotic you were taking activates the pregnane X receptor, which will provoke the liver into creating more of the necessary enzymes to break down the caffeine - you will metabolize it faster.</p>

<p>Just a theory on that one - I’m kind of wondering myself now if there may be some correlation between being a slow metabolizer of certain substances and anhedonia. </p>

<p>As we age our bodies don’t produce quite as much of these enzymes - at least in my case, I’m wondering if I’ve become more sensitive to certain drugs like bupropion because I can’t break it down as quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am a slow caffeine metabolizer. Ive also been on TRT for years even before my current problems and probably the E2 slows it down more.</p>

<p>That is interesting about the antibiotic though. </p>

<p>Im also slow cyp2d6, 2/4 (1 normal and 1 nonfunctional allele)</p>

<p>Im staying away from wellbutrin lol bc it also inhibits cyp2d6 more and is potent NRI. Armodafinil is like the only stim I tolerate and the DRI improves my symptoms</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do some 2 mile runs but doesn’t really help feel emotion.</p>

<p>Yea ive seen a psychiatrist. He says this is a really unusual noradrenergic sensitivity but we don’t really know what to do about it. SSRI/SNRI/TCA all contraindicated due to this sensitivity and/or genetics. For now I have armodafinil as needed for symptomatic relief, as well as Klonopin. One option he is willing to do once it is out is Zuranolone given my response to GABAergics. We think inflammation is somehow involved also. </p>

<p>I also started Ketamine infusion, and last week it seemed to help ease the blunting a bit after a few days until suddenly Wednesday inadvertant caffeine exposure when I meant to get decaf took my emotions away again. So I had another infusion yesterday and hoping it helps again. Have to avoid using Kpin while I do the infusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds pretty complex, a lot of spinning plates you’ve got going there. I’ve been in a similar situation, it feels like playing whack-a-mole. You fix one symptom but another , or multiple  pop up as a side-effect of the medication you’ve taken to fix the first, and on it goes. One should always be wary of Polypharmacy, even though it tends to be the norm these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but when I went off some stuff it gets hard to even get through the day. For example I need Guanfacine (mine is prescribed) and Bromantane to even help cope with this. </p>

<p>I dont take Klonopin nor Armodafinil daily.</p>

<p>I was actually doing a decent amount better earlier this week, and was not planning to mess with anything else. Things were back to a manageable level. </p>

<p>But of course caffeine is my kryptonite ever since last year and when I was intending to just enjoy taking a walk and thinking I was having decaf I started feeling more blunted and horrible. Checked what I ordered and turned out it wasn’t decaf at all. </p>

<p>At this point I am just trying to get back to the manageable level since the caffeine exposure. Then I suppose wait for Zuranolone hopefully itll be next month. </p>

<p>Theres something completely fucked I suspect with my gut/inflammation leading to this insane sensitivity since covid last year and it needs desperate addressing in terms of a root cause. Everything else at this point just seems like its covering up symptoms, which is useful for relief but its not going to prevent such a debilitating reaction that could happen seemingly any time on accident. At least allopregnanolone has some evidence of lowering inflammation and restoring the gut so I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take 0.5-1 mg Guanfacine every night actually. It slightly helps, particularly in tolerating armodafinil, but I wonder if its the Beta adrenergic receptors instead and cortisol response that are the issue.  </p>

<p>Also this isn’t normal, so im trying to find out how I can get to the root of this insane sensitivity. So many anhedonia treatments rely on increasing NE that even to treat my condition, I believe I need to remove the sensitivity (which might remove my condition as well). </p>

<p>I suspect the immune system somehow being involved in this, like maybe I am not able to tolerare downstream inflammation from the caffeine increasing NE, whereas on rifaximin I could.</p>

<p>The rifaximin allowing me to tolerate it again is the very weird thing and some sort of clue</p>
