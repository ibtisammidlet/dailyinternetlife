    <div class="md"><p>I have Sunifiram from Powdercity ðŸ˜† I have it in the refrigerator so I think it Is well preserved.
About potency: always good, 0.1 MG feels excellent.
Only problem with Sunifiram Is the lacks of studies about safety, but Is one of the best nootropics out there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lost a lot of weight on it. Although it was very stim like it had some nootropic value but it seems to be to big of a risk vs reward I canâ€™t remember the other version which was apparently safer and sunifiram is a dirty analog of oh yeah itâ€™s UNIFIRAM granted I never took uni but I would seek that out over aunifiram I only included the weight loss to point out how close to a stim it is.</p>

<p>Edit I Have tired uni I just was having a brain shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I wonder if you are actually taking sunifiram? Maybe its mislabeled by the vendor. Which vendor did you get it from?</p>

<p>Unifiram works a lot better for focus &amp; flow-state for me. Sunifiram is less noticeable and kinda works in the background, such that I&#39;d notice the same kind of effect but only after reflecting over my day.</p>

<p>So basically I&#39;m saying that unifiram is more in my face with its nootropic effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I think I felt the same actually now that you mentioned it. And futher processing of the time I took it made me reflect I was stacking with adrafinil everyday. Never experienced excitotoxicity even with noopept I got mine I canâ€™t remember bionootropics or umbrella labs</p>

<p>EditBut either way it felt like a stim: I read somewhere it is converted into piperazine but UNI was I thought more in the back ground. My gf tired it also and was like if that is related to piracetam then that piracetam did crack hahah thatâ€™s what she said.</p>

<p>Also it may have been science.bio Iâ€™ve since. Thrown it out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you might be right about the stim part- I noticed that I was sweating more than usual despite the cold outside while walking. It may be dose dependent.</p>

<p>Oh, why&#39;d you throw it out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never ever EVER combine it with modafinil or related stimulants.  Can result in persistent headaches and odd cognitive effects that took months to go away.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only nootropic that &quot;damaged me&quot;. I was using modafinil and some Adderall at the time.  </p>

<p>My memory was improved.  Most notably, I could get super drunk and/or high, and have UNBELIEVABLY good verbal fluency.  But eventually everything started sounding too loud. It&#39;s like the combo slowly turned up the gain on my brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I get more irritated easily on it. So I stopped it for now (the sunifiram).</p>

<p>So far I&#39;d say that unifiram is a lot better &amp; useful in my experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would imagine so if it came in one of those moisture absorbent double storage containers... never got around to trying it but was quite Interested in it when I was 15. Apparently if dosed too high may cause headaches if I remember correctly so be careful but let me know how you get on if you do!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I used and still have some unifiram and sunifiram I bought like 1-3 years ago from Science bio before they closed &amp; re opened.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about sunifiram, but I get a very strong hyper focus on unifiram. Makes a huge difference for studying. When I use it I get a tight feeling sometimes in my head and I just keep going when normally I would have given up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try some more of my sunifiram today &amp; let you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like a more effective learning session with increased engagement. The retention of the information &amp; It&#39;s comprehensive is improved.</p>

<p>In general for long term storage, you need to practice spaced repetition to really engrain the information.</p>
