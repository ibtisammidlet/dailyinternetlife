        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to examine page on Nefiracetam:</p>

<p>&quot;An increased release of acetylcholine (200-211% of baseline within 10-30 minutes, lasting 60 minutes) has been confirmed in the prefrontal cortex of rats fed 1mg/kg nefiracetam (human dose of 0.16mg/kg) with 3-10mg/kg being similarly effective.[38][39] While the release is sensitive to tetradotoxin[39] it is not affected by scopolamine[38] and longer term studies using 10mg/kg have failed to note alterations in basal acetylcholine concentrations (in healthy rats and in brain damaged rats).[40]&quot;</p>

<p>This Is similar to Sunifiram:</p>

<p>&quot;Sunifiram injections at 0.01mg/kg are able to facilitate acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex of rats, with no apparent efficacy at 1mg/kg.[4] The magnitude was around 200% of baseline within an hour of injection.[4]&quot;</p>

<p>The study using 1 MG/Kg doses of Nefiracetam in rats, shows increased PKCalpha and CaMKII activation. Nefiracetam and Sunifiram not only have a similar mechanism of action, both compounds shared the dose responde trend, by having different effects of low doses compared by higher doses.</p>

<p>Since Nefiracetam has more studies compared to Sunifiram, it is possible 1) Use Nefiracetam instead of Sunifiram to be more certain about the safety of the compound. 2) It is possible to draw conclusions about the safety and mechanism of action of Sunifiram by extrapolating the results of Nefiracetam, so we can expand our knowledge of Sunifiram. Nefiracetam has studies in humans. It is worth reading them to see how the authors elaborate on the supposed kidney toxicity of Nefiracetam in dogs. In mice and rhesus monkeys, no kidney toxicity was observed, on the other hand, the dose in dogs was quite high. </p>

<p>In my experience, Sunifiram is one of the best nootropics that can exist, plus it is cheap. I have experimented with different doses, and low doses of 0.1 - 0.2 mg produce a very good effect in cognition (memory, processing Speed, focus), different from doses greater than 1 mg. Those results are in line with the effects of Sunifiram at low doses, where a 200% release of acetylcholine is observed in the prefrontal cortex. </p>

<p>In conclusion, for those using Nefiracetam, it is worth exploring the effects of low doses that are in line with the 1 mg/kg dose in rats. That dose is transferred in humans to a dose of 0.16 mg/kg</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems that Nefiracetam is a PAM of the Glycine site of the NMDAR (I knew this already), but what I didn&#39;t know is that Sunifiram is apparently an agonist of the Glycine NMDAR. Theoretically it&#39;s possible that both may be synergistic. I will start some experiments with low dose Nefiracetam in combimation with low dose Sunifiram and report back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I&#39;ve done extensive experimentation with Nefiracetam and higher doses have always caused a slight relaxation (possibly due to the GABA-ergic mechanism). Low doses are slightly stimulating, which may be due to this ACh release or NMDA-Glycine PAM activity. I&#39;ve never dosed as low as 10mg orally though.</p>

<p>Sunifiram does not have the GABA modulation as far as I&#39;m aware. An interesting question would be to what extent Nefiracetam exerts its pro-cognitive effects through GABA modulation (since, for example, GABAA5 NAMs exert cognitive enhancing effects).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could try low doses of Nefiracetam like those indicated in the studies cited in Examine. I don&#39;t have Nefiracetam to do my experiments. What I can say is that Sunifiram subjectively produces different effects at low doses versus high doses. In high doses it increases the ability to encode long-term memories, but excessively reduces the speed of processing and textual comprehension. In low doses it increases precisely that: speed, comprehension and working memory also. Memory is not affected in the same way as at high doses, but it is still there increased.
If you find interesting results in low doses, report them please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info. I think I&#39;m going to start 10mg Nefiracetam + 0.1mg Sunifiram, both dosed orally in the AM. I have to check if I still have some Suni, but otherwise it&#39;s easily available. Nefiracetam is also available at major sellers btw.</p>
