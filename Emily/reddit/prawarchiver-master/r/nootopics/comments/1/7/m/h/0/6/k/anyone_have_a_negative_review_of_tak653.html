    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read an older post stating that some of these types of drugs will do that. In my case, i&#39;m not entirely sure if it&#39;s beneficial because I consider myself as someone who has a lot of self awareness even when i&#39;m not taking any cognition enhancing drugs. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The plus side to TAK653 is that I do notice an improvement in my speech. I&#39;ve always struggled with being able to hold a conversation but TAK653 allows me match my thoughts to the pace at which im speaking? I know that doesn&#39;t make any sense but it&#39;s a slightly strange but pleasant sensation I get while talking to people now. Prior to TAK653, having conversations with people was a chore and everything that comes out of my mouth seems to come out awkwardly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I think this is true to an extent, but (and this is speaking from personal experiences) there are some mental configurations where the enhanced cognition is creating suffering.</p>

<p>&quot;We suffer much more in imagination than in reality&quot;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re prone to paranoia, if you have a negative self image, if you don&#39;t have healthy ways of externalizing thoughts and feelings, this enhanced cognition can become your worst enemy, and progressively make you your own worst enemy for no good reason at all. </p>

<p>The trick then is realizing that this overthinking coupled with the unfortunately natural negativity bias that can be inflated from traumatic experience, is in fact the culprit. The cognition enhancement can get you to this point, you can think yourself into the conclusion you think too much or have malformed thought patterns, but that road is long and winding unless you have some form of guidance like a therapist (schema therapy specifically alongside CBT or DBT depending is quite helpful for this purpose)</p>

<p>Again, I think your point does ring true. But it is also the same justification used to burrow into deeply negative patterns of thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do broadly agree with you, but I will add that enhanced cognition generally will make you more aware of those things in your life that you may have previously run from or ignored; these things must be approached from a new perspective, with a new mind. One cannot solve problems in the same mind that created them, as Einstein pointed out.</p>

<p>One, however, can have enhanced cognition and be in a worse state because of it, but we can use enhanced cognition to find a better solution than we ever could have before.</p>

<p>Of course, enhancing cognition is not the whole solution, it is just an aspect of it. We need mental models, daily practices, techniques and methods for operating our lives most effectively and having a mission/ideal to achieve driven by deep-rooted purpose.</p>

<p>Without a mission, problems creep in; we become worried for the future, or trapped by the past. I believe further down in the comments you also mention &#39;radical acceptance&#39;; I am certainly onboard with this way of thought. To completely accept the events of the past is to be freed from them, and to envision and craft the future as part of your mission is to be freed from the issues which naturally arise as a result of living with no meaningful, deep purpose.</p>

<p>Accept the past, create the future.</p>

<p>Cultivate greatness, my friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was such an insightful post. </p>

<p>I am an overthinker, somewhat paranoid, and I have a negative self image. I also have not found a healthy way of externalizing my thoughts and feelings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something you may find helpful is this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.attachmentproject.com/early-maladaptive-schemas/">https://www.attachmentproject.com/early-maladaptive-schemas/</a></p>

<p>Its a test to determine which common &#39;thinking errors&#39; or maladaptive schemas as they are called, are present for you.</p>

<p>I would caution on taking this test, however. I would wait until you&#39;re in a stable place to take it because the results might be overwhelming. When I took it, I placed &#39;very high&#39; on 10/18 of them, and &#39;high&#39; on 5/18 and man, that was a blow in and of itself. </p>

<p>But it did point in 100% the right direction.</p>

<p>I went from being ruled by these things to being way more fulfilled and stable than I&#39;ve ever been in the course of ~2 months (granted, I was blessed to be in the position to take that first month off from all responsibility to focus solely on processing all of this and if it&#39;s in your power to do so, I cannot recommend taking a month off everything to do the following:</p>

<p>-Prompted journaling on what events are responsible for forming these beliefs (this is the easiest form of finding that outlet of expression, and as demonized as it is, alcohol is very helpful in being able to dive into this with low anxiety and thereby relative objectivity) (also handwriting on paper is more helpful than typing if possible)</p>

<p>-RIGOROUSLY and HONESTLY testing how valid these claims are</p>

<p>-Finding forgiveness for yourself (and neatly, thereby others) for the parts of self-critique that ARE valid and learning to love yourself through that as you would others in the same position, and vice versa</p>

<p>-Working on something that is either a passion project or purely recreation (for me it was music, I make music and have been putting it out for almost 4 years with almost 0 traction, but it&#39;s always well received by those who are able to find it, I gotta get bussing on social media LMAO)</p>

<p>-Reconnecting with people who you HIGHLY value that you have become distant from for any variety of reasons (speaking with patient friends is another great form of externalization)</p>

<p>-(This is redundant given the sub we&#39;re on but) finding a stack that works for you for these purposes. For me, it was/is:</p>

<p>-300-600mg L-Theanine (higher dose range for if taking any stimulants such as caffeine)</p>

<p>-300mg Magnesium (Elemental, from Glycinate)</p>

<p>-1.3g NAC</p>

<p>-1.5g ALCAR</p>

<p>-1.2g Alpha-GPC</p>

<p>-(2-4 times a week) 200-300mg Caffeine</p>

<p>-(may not be an option, but) 125-200mg Ketamine (insufflated) 2-4 times a month (also ketamine therapy legally is more acquirable now than ever)</p>

<p>The first 3 were the most crucial for this. I can vouch for NootropicsDepot brand L-Theanine and Toniiq for NAC and Mag Glycinate</p>

<p>I understand how blessed I am to be in the position to be able to have the time off to do all of this, and if it&#39;s impossible to take the time off to do this, just do as much as you can with the time you have. But if you can make it work, the return on investment is HUGE</p>

<p>If you have an esoteric/philosophical bone in your body, I took an approach of doing Shadow (Jungian) work through an alchemical lense. Which is to say, finding the parts of myself I reject and trying to accept them (hint: everyone is capable of all things, you have to become able to accept and love yourself for your capacity for &quot;evil&quot; (all of which, has its place)) As well as finding a way to transmute the &quot;lead (heavy negative experiences)&quot; into &quot;Gold (positive results of the same)&quot;</p>

<p>The simplest example is the one right in front of all of this. The self-critique is an attempt at doing this, run rampant. The overthinking and negative self-image are an ATTEMPT at making yourself &quot;better.&quot; But it&#39;s counterproductive in the end. That voice has a purpose, but it&#39;s placed way too far at the forefront and has gained a lot of unwarranted &quot;Trust&quot; for the reason stated in the above comment.</p>

<p>And as much as I hate this term for the new-agey vibe it&#39;s found itself attached to, &quot;radical acceptance&quot; is something profoundly helpful.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad the first comment was helpful, and I hope this one is more or less helpful as well. I&#39;ve been there, and made it more or less out, so anything I can do to help others in the same position, I will. I wish you luck, I believe in you, and as always (as per username), Safe Travels ☿</p>

<p>DMs are open if you need anything else, suggestions, guidance (though I still doubt how valid what I have to offer in those realms is) or simply a direction to externalize in (rant)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On your last point first, no one should be blindly taking anything. Everyone should do their own research. I&#39;ve determined what works for me, and I feel that is worth sharing (where would I be if people didn&#39;t share that info themselves? I&#39;m just passing the torch)</p>

<p>And yes of course. L-Theanine not being water soluble might pose some bioavailability issues. I&#39;ve been considering some self trials with Bioperine to see if that helps. But the dosages listed seem effective (for me) and L-Theanine is one of the cheaper supplements. </p>

<p>And the NAC yes of course. The anhedionia happens in some and not in others (my bet is it is genetic): It should also be cycled (3-4 weeks on, 1 week off) since it can interfere with the absorption of certain minerals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to eat a lot of black pepper, even supplementing piperine, but i think inhibiting glucuronidation often is not advisable.  it detoxes all kinds of stuff. 
 And piperine has a long half life.  Piperine is even a Pgp inhibitor which among other things is critical for everyday brain detox.  Not trying to  nitpick everything that&#39;s just one of my biggest dietary regrets in recent memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I started taking the quiz but felt I still wasn&#39;t in the right state of mind yet. Just curious but in what way are the results overwhelming for you? Were you just not expecting to have those maladaptive traits or were they a complete eye opener for you? </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>You&#39;re definitely in a blessed position to take time off however, I can no longer make excuses for my situation either. I still have to work a 9-5 job but let&#39;s just say other than work, I&#39;m given an ample amount of time to get what I need done. I just choose to cope and daydreaming my problems away while listening to music(i&#39;m exactly like Ben Stiller from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty). It&#39;s coping mechanism that I&#39;ve conditioned myself for 20 years now. I&#39;ve realized I&#39;ve wasted so much of my life away instead of stepping out of my comfort zone and facing my fears... Honestly just bringing this up makes it more depressing for me. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Journaling is something I know I NEED to do but for whatever reason it ends up being on my long list of procrastination items. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s funny you bring up reconnecting with friends that I highly value because I do have a few friends that I consider high value and for whatever reason I distanced myself away from ALL of them. These days i&#39;m just spending time with my much older cousin. Who is a good person albeit a bit weird and full of himself. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I appreciate the supplement stack list. NAC and Alpha GPC are in my supp stack but I do use it sparingly as I&#39;ve noticed myself becoming depressed if I take too much or too often. Alpha GPC is done every other day once in the morning and NAC is also every other day once in the morning. Micro Mag(by nootropics depot) is done every night before bed. I need to look into ALCAR... but L-theanine. I&#39;m not sure wtf happened with that. Because initially I absolutely loved taking it then it started to take a turn for me. I feel awful taking any amount and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the brand i&#39;m taking but I did order a NDepot L-Theanine that i&#39;m hesitant to try right now. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about this Jungian Shadowing. I&#39;ll have to do some research on it. I do know that loving yourself is important. I&#39;ve heard the saying that no one will love you unless you love yourself.. It&#39;s just hard when you see yourself as a piece of shit person you know? It&#39;s like how could I even love myself when I know and believe that I am a shitty person?</p>

<p>I agree with the self-criticsm  being there for a reason. There was a psychologist that I listened to and he believes that when you feel bad, it&#39;s the universe telling you to get your act straight...but you&#39;re absolutely correct that sometimes those feedback and voices become counter productive especially for some people like me who don&#39;t know how to use it in a positive way. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I actually will take you up on that offer, man. If you really mean that and you&#39;re not bothered by me DM&#39;ing you.  Thanks again, and I&#39;m sorry for taking so long to get back.</p>

<li>it was a shock to me not because I was terribly surprised by anything the results had to say, but it was like. &quot;I know I&#39;m fucked somehow, but having it quantified and telling me I&#39;m really fucked is kinda scary&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>-There is a time and place for that state of mind, in fact I find the music/daydreaming (usually while walking long distance) is a crucial part of my routine for my overall health. Its good you recognize it gets away from you though, some more focused time could be beneficial.</p>

<li><p>I&#39;ve recently reformed a LOT of habits and I find it increases adherence 10-fold if I do the things I find I procrastinate within the first few hours of waking up, the sooner or better. It makes it way harder to get distracted or put it off, or run out of energy to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitely hit up those friends, most if not all will be glad to hear from you :) set up a lunch or something similar to the circumstances you found yourself around them to begin with.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course on the stack :) that&#39;s the nature of this sub. And it very well could be the brand, I was taking walmart&#39;s spring valley and found it minimally effective, NDs is FAR more effective and clean. I think it comes down to low quality control leading to a racemic mixture of L and D-theanine which compete for absorption, and the D isomer isn&#39;t effective. At worst, it could also be contaminants 💀 maybe it isn&#39;t for you, but I can vouch for ND brand and would suggest trying it a time or 2 to see if it works any better for you</p></li>
<li><p>And that&#39;s kind of precisely the point. You see yourself as a piece of shit. BUT. If someone else had some of your percieved flaws, I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t judge them as harshly as you judge yourself. So why judge yourself that harshly? Also, some of those critiques are legitimate, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean people should be rejected for them, being products of their environment and all. This video is a good introduction to the subject, the whole channel is great for philosophy and esotericism.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say I am blasted away by the effects of tak-653. I just dropped Suboxone at 20mg with my own detox stack from reading a ton on Reddit😂. At the end, I used this substance and continue to. I feel as if I have the learning skills of when I was younger. The only negative effect I experienced was too much stimulation. The first dose I used was 4mg; but, I was also  still in the end of my withdrawal. So, I don&#39;t know specifically why I experienced those effects. But, it was so uncomfortable that I went to 1mg and have stayed on since.</p>
