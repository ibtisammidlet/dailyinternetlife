        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I recently began drinking coffee every morning and it started well for my productivity. However now if I don’t have it I’m stupidly lethargic. But the reason I started drinking it is because I usually was anyways. So the fact that I am now pretty dependent on caffeine but I still get things done when I drink it to me implies even though the effects aren’t as potent as when I was caffeine naive caffeine still leaves people above baseline unlike the common “as you drink coffee it stops giving you energy and you drink it to feel normal”. Are there studies to back this up or am I wrong and this is placebo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teacrine, a supplement from teas, is a stimulant that is about as powerful as caffeine. Research shows it improves productivity. It does last longer, so take it earlier, but people don’t develop tolerance - at least in the 6 week studies.</p>

<p>Methylliberine is similar stim, but it has a shorter half life. I believe tolerance is similar to caffeine.</p>

<p>Phenylpiracitam is stronger with an even shorter half life, and you develop a tolerance very quickly. It’s a pill, and you can redose during the day. I don’t ever take it more than two days a week.</p>

<p>Three grams of kratom feels like a happy, triple espresso (but taking more makes me tired.) I’ve taken the same dose for a year and it’s only slightly less effective. It’s a lot like matcha but tastes worse. Take the powder as a toss and wash.  It is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, so it can help with pain. Its about as strong as Tylenol, gram for gram. Some heavy users be minor withdrawal symptoms for a couple days if they quit.  I’ve used it after surgery in place of rx opiates because it is so much safer (it won’t kill you) and just as effective (for me at least). If taken with isolates, it actually makes them less addictive.</p>

<p>Some use Nicotine gum, which really is an effective nootropic. We all know there is tolerance there. </p>

<p>The Russian peptide Semax is a stimulant as is Selank. Oddly, Selank is also an anxiolytic as well. You take these by squeezing a mist up your nose. People often cycle these.</p>

<p>I quit coffee (heartburn), so I now use teacrine, kratom and amphetamines every morning, and take a second dose of kratom some afternoons. I feel no stimulation by dinner time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, if you are used to Xmg every day, then if you have Xmg on a certain day you are more productive than if you were used to 0mg and had 0mg.</p>

<p>Sure caffeine usage provokes tolerance and withdrawal, but it s not a complete tolerance/withdrawal.</p>

<p>You should note that this effect takes into account the fact that you are not sleep deprived. If coffee usage troubles your sleeping time, then you are worse off than if you didn’t take caffeine at all. If for any other reason you are sleep deprived (night shifts, sleep apnea, no time to sleep, can’t sleep,…), then coffee is even better for you.</p>

<p>Btw if you wanna maximize the effects of coffee, reduce the time frame you consume caffeine every day. The longer your body is in withdrawal, the better is the recovery. </p>

<p>It means waiting a few hours after waking up, and stop after an arbitrary period of time (say stop after 3PM)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a source for this? Most studies I see on caffeine show its effects are mostly caused by withdrawal reversal after initial tolerance. During daily use the negative impact on sleep is seemingly unavoidable due to caffeine&#39;s long half life. </p>

<p>To me it looks like a reallocation of energy that is confined to the peak effects of caffeine during withdrawal reversal and surrounded by a dip below baseline. What makes me think it&#39;s a net negative is sleep disruption causing day-time fatigue on top of this.</p>

<p>I just use caffeine and prescription stims everyday (6/7 for stims) and that s okay enough. My situation may thus not be appliable to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>learn the art of playing with levels of caffeine/tannins. alternate between coffee and Yerba Mate, Guayusa, and Green Tea (needs to be hq Sencha and brewed properly). coffee alone deos the trick i know, thought in some days u can use Mate/Guayusa and it will give a constant energy instaed of big spike, much better than nothing and won&#39;t add as much to tolerance or even crash if any, what you can do is in the days of Mate/Guayusa/Green tea etc  use also some B vitamins, Shilajit, MCT Oil combo and see the alchemy you made ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>white tea as well is great for the days when it would be considered really low to no caffeine/tannins, it&#39;s good enough to not cause big withdrawals of caffeine but still comfy enough. w shouldn&#39;t try to overstimulate each day maximum dopamine, some days is fine for us to relax, recover, no stimulation etc because this is what makes the good days work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s been my experience the last couple of weeks. white tea within an hour of waking really helps to start the day going, gently, while not causing any stimulation or crash or insomnia. i think the caffeine content is around 30mg so probably not enough to cause tolerance/withdrawal. and the theanine content really helps smooth it out.</p>
