        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello everyone! </p>

<p>When I was in high school and early uni years, I was really into lucid dreaming. I loved it. Letâ€™s say I could control like 80% of a dream and sometimes wake myself up when I realizing Iâ€™m dreaming haha.</p>

<p>Back then, I was taking 0 substance during the day or before bed, not even sure about coffee.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a whole mÃ©thode and things to do several times a day (look at your hand, a clock, journal your dreams). My favorite one Â«Â transferred me from wakefulness to a lucid dreamÂ Â». It was closing your eyes and only focus on the images/visuals you see with maintained shut eyes. It took some time but it literally took me in a like a water slide to the dream land portal. It was a visual / psyche experience almost. </p>

<p>:(  Then sleep issues developed and I started taking like 0,25mg Alpra to sleep and it was fine. Weed was also amazing for this purpose. Alcohol had terrible effects on my sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never abused benzos, really almost only used them for sleep, i do not feel anything recreational about it. Not necessarily a good strategy but I switch between alprazolam, Bromazolam, pyrazolamâ€¦ ðŸ˜¢ still no dreaming or at least dream recalls. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also sometimes take, theralene, Tercian, </p>

<p>And Zopiclone is cool for sleep. 80% of the time, I swallowed it and fell asleep in the next few minutes, even without feeling sleepy a bit, i find it so efficient in this way but i the love drifting into sleep while being tired. I took it for 2 or 3 years straight maybe. Didnâ€™t not take the time to study long terme adverse effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely no dreaming, lucid dreaming or having nightmares on it this molecule.</p>

<p>The only dreams I can recall are those following naps (very rare). Thereâ€™s an explanation for that but i forgot, cause fkng bad decisions about depending on benzos to sleep</p>

<p>Melatonin isnâ€™t sufficient to sleep for me </p>
</blockquote>

<p>// I would really go back into the LUCID DREAMING world and would appreciate any advice, sleep hygiene ritual or hygiene (not browsing Reddit!before sleep, lmprovement to be made on dreaming with molecules or trying to remember and journal them and finally your very honest opinion about the nootropics and supplements, lots of money soent</p>

<p>// substances recommendations? </p>

<p>Thank you all so much. Will also post on Stack &amp; Noottopics</p>

<p>â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” &lt; a part from the mood stabilizing molecule, I do not use all of those, certainly not at the same tilme</p>

<p>[Ongoing prescription treatment]: 
-Fighting depression relapses - Balancing negative emotions: I have a borderline personality not a bipolar disorder,</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>250 lamotrigine, 400 lithium carbo to be abandoned, 10 diazepam rarely used, 0,5 alpra just incassable but I need more to sleep </p>

</blockquote>

<p>-Random nootropics I use: I almost consider them placebo, they all seem promising on lab rats research tests and redditors feedbacks, but Iâ€™m not at all serious about cycling them. I donâ€™t see any improvements from any or all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also used to lucid dream pretty regularly (3-4) times per week during college years (it took a while of training).</p>

<p>When I first started taking TAK-653 regularly, I would have extremely vivid dreams if i took it in late afternoon (and still do if I take it that late). About 40% of the time it resulted in lucid dreams with a high degree of contextual awareness.</p>

<p>Combine it with citicoline and tropisetron and I imagine lucid dreaming would come pretty easily. In fact, Iâ€™ll try that tonight lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not that night! But Iâ€™ve been trying it in the evening with that combo for the past week and I did in fact have one night with very, very high lucidity. Iâ€™m surprised it was only one night, but the quality of the lucid dream was definitely impressive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thereâ€™s a book called Projection of the Astral Body by Sylvan Muldoon that has invaluable information about how projection, dreams, and how we fall asleep and what physical factors play into oneâ€™s ability to remain conscious while moving into other mental states. Something that stood out to me is his focus on the heart rate, and how drugs that prevent your heart rate from dropping enough during sleep will prevent projection and lucid dreaming. It started making sense why my past experiences with things that relax you, like phenibut hcl, can influence lucid dreaming and projection in a positive way, but I found while they made my dreams vivid, I didnâ€™t learn how to do it better and ultimately didnâ€™t have control. Iâ€™ve personally found that, while supplements or drugs can help improve memory, recall, or vividness, nothing actually helps you become conscious in those mental states. Proper suggestion and training your conscious mind to click into awareness at the right time is the only straightforward way to accomplish it. Supplements really muddy everything up, imo. Iâ€™d wager that youâ€™d be better off learning to properly lucid dream or project first, and then consider a supp or drug to increase recall clarity if you find itâ€™s necessary by that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that completely. Training worked great for me when I was younger. But since I really canâ€™t sleep without being very sleepy and thatâ€™s why I use benzos, I canâ€™t remember my dreams at all. And that is literally the first step of training</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mention 2 different sleeping issues. Logically there would thus also be substances that could help one but damage the other. Which is exactly what you are doing.</p>

<p>From the 2 sleeping problems:<br/>
-getting rejuvinative sleep.<br/>
-getting lucid dreams.<br/>
... it would be logical to first tackle tackling the former, the more urgent one.</p>

<p>Substances you use that do that, but in turn decrease your lucid dreams are: Weed, Benzo</p>

<p>Replace those with substances that help both. Substances that help both are rare, but you can find them for them being in regards to the term: &#39;sleep hyerarchiture&#39;. Weed doesn&#39;t help, because it&#39;s mainly THC. But some other cannabinoid: CBN, or it&#39;s more potent bother: CBNo, are really promosing for that.</p>

<p>Also 5-htp helps me A LOT with getting rejuvinative sleep</p>

<p>Tianeptine seems to induce the most lucid rem sleeps without noticably reducing rejuvinating sws</p>
