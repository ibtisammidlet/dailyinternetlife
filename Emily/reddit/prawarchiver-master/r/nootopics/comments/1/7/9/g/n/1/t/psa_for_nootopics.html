<p>Magic isn&#39;t necessary to evolve mankind. If you want to get left behind, then do it, and stop tagging me about it. I created this place so we could understand how to surpass our natural limits, not limit ourselves with a defeatist mentality.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read the countless studies demonstrating substances improving cognition in healthy people, then keep your advice and opinions to yourself. This is not the place for you.</p>

<p>We have been out of the infancy stages of cognition enhancement for some time now and things will only get better as time progresses. There is so much potential in what could be done through pharmacology to benefit the world as a whole, and not just those who suffer from a disorder or illness.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see that, then I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. I have lived it. And I know it&#39;s real. Others have too, outside of your echo chambers. Measurable increases to various aspects of intelligence including IQ, and only after the introduction of a nootropic.</p>

I&#39;ve been into them for years, I&#39;m just not active in any reddits based on them but I discuss them daily with friends and take 25+ nootropics daily. And you have quite the ego my friend, claiming you single handedly got people off of hard drugs. That&#39;s hysterical. That&#39;s now how that works, maybe you provided information that helped some people ultimately stop using, but they had to do something with that information.  It&#39;s their choice to stop using.

    <div class="md"><p>I can assure you my mother wouldn&#39;t have quit drinking and using kratom if I didn&#39;t stop her. The dozens of people I explained why they should quit, taught how to taper off, and gave alternatives/ things to help the process wouldn&#39;t have quit otherwise. Just like I never would have quit kratom had someone not told me opioids tank testosterone. So I credit that person, although I hated them at the time, for getting me &quot;off&quot; it, just as much as myself.</p>

<p>You&#39;re convinced I&#39;m a narcissist for just living my life, spreading knowledge, and trying to be helpful. I never understood this rhetoric. I assume people conflate pride with narcissism. I&#39;m proud about what I do. I&#39;m not a narcissist.</p>

<p>My dad was a narcissist. I know what narcissists are like, and I&#39;m not one of them. A narcissist will emotionally manipulate you for their own gain, make everything about them, and have their own special place in hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dopamine, dopamine,  dopamine. Everyone talks about dopamine. What about Norepinephrine? </p>

<p>Read a few research articles saying ADHD-I types are more deficient in Norepinephrine and ADHD-H types Dopamine. My dopamine was fine till Adderall screwed it up. My Norepinephrine was the problem and even worse now. </p>

<p>Any research in upregulating Norepinephrine pathways? I know Strattera is a NRI. But doesn&#39;t register much since Adderall damaged everything so much.  One concern is Strattera with Adderall will prevent NE pathways from repairing or upregulating.  Something that can help with repair long term while I attempt to heal and transition off adderall over the next year or 2 would be great. I know  NE is made from DA so upregulating Tyrosine Hydroxylase should help both.  And some pathways are shared and work on both NE and DA. So upregulating DA may help in shared pathways.  But NE specific nootropics or neuroprotection would be great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve read the studies, and the while the results are significant, in healthy NON SLEEP DEPRIVED, non stressed humans, the results are incredibly underwhelming and limited to arbitrary proxies of cognitive function such as digit recall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re using words that you don&#39;t understand. &quot;Arbitrary proxies of cognitive function&quot;, how are these arbitrary, and how are these proxies? They&#39;re aspects of cognitive function that are specific and measurable and form the basis of expectations in one direction or another.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a good thing if 100% of your brain was being utilized at once because the concept of &quot;NZT&quot; is pseudoscientific. But actually, AMPA PAMs which birthed the first nootropic of all time, Piracetam, ACTUALLY DO ACTIVATE MORE PARTS OF THE BRAIN that would otherwise be dormant, such as the precuneus.</p>

<p>Leveraging your issues such as poor stress management and sleep deprivation into the equation definitely isn&#39;t a legitimate contradiction, even if I struggle with those same issues. The whole point of using healthy subjects is to surpass the natural baseline beyond what would&#39;ve been possible otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they&#39;re abstract in the sense of being only measurable of cognitive function, and in that, only <em>presumed</em> to be representative. That&#39;s what makes it an abstraction. Not that it isn&#39;t accurate in some sense--that&#39;s what the entire realm of cognitive science is about--but it is in fact only a measure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not unreasonable to question the efficacy of nootropics as a whole given that the field of study has not seen much research compared to other subjects. And when you do look at other subjects, you find that even the most studied pharmaceuticals aren&#39;t fully understood, and what is also has an air of doubt around it.</p>

<p>That sets a pretty high bar for any one study showing efficacy of a nootropic to meet, and an even higher bar for a scientific consensus regarding the matter, which there doesn&#39;t seem to be. And given that there really has not been definitive disproof of placebo effect at play in anecdote-driven communities, I think the skepticism is entirely warranted.</p>

<p>People really only have the option of trying it themselves at the end of the day, and even that&#39;s not very reliable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Study corruption is prevalent, and anecdotes are awful evidence due to placebo, astroturfing, and hypnosis. However, when the pharmacokinetics check out, we understand the entire pathway for results from the chemical transfers and neuronal interactions up and then have studies in healthy people repeatedly demonstrating benefit, I&#39;d say we definitely have evidence they work.</p>

<p>Especially when things like CDP-Choline have a plethora of successful studies, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t in the Stone Ages, and these things are better understood than ever, but yes of course it will keep getting better. In terms of comparing it to older pharmaceutical ventures, the accuracy is going to be greater when it&#39;s using modernized technology and works from the basis of accomplished scientific feats to draw conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re both right.   We have a much better understanding of the pharmacokinetics than ever before; however, the brain and cognition are incredibly complex.  We don&#39;t even understand the fundamentals of consciousness let alone the net effect of 99/100 &quot;brain boosters&quot; or nootropics etc.</p>

<p>Hell, we haven&#39;t even arrived at consensus on diet - even st the MACRO level.   To think that we&#39;ve mastered micro medicine is a little wild. </p>

<p>Of course some nootropics are simpler like choline - as you point out.   However, even there lies significant genetic variation which may cause negative rather than positive effects from increased choline. </p>

<p>Others are much more complex...even ketamine which has been studied and used and abused more than most - and is currently approved for treatment resistant depression.   How exactly does it assist with depression?  There are only theories with clinics using wildly different treatment regimens.</p>

<p>How exactly does agmatine help or hurt people?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s only safe to say that we know a little and that it&#39;s healthy for people to be skeptical - even of the studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just not productive to deny the evidence we already have on the results in people and the molecular mechanisms that lead up to that conclusion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to be curious and take it upon yourself to look into the literature more but saying it&#39;s too complicated to understand is a stretch from the truth, more reflective of the knowledge of the person who claims that.</p>

<p>Ketamine improves depression through two mechanisms: first, it is a nmda antagonist which increases glutamate release in the hippocampus leading to more ampa activation, bdnf and finally mtor 1 which has positive effects on its own and retroactively activates nr2b in certain neurons over others which changes synaptic connections aka memories and can influence depression via that, the strengthing and weakening of various memories</p>

<p>Ketamine also contains a metabolite that is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor</p>

<p>Agmatine is a polyamine site of the nmda antagonist and this functionally negatively modulates synaptic nr2b which produces glutamate release again leading to a similar outcome</p>

<p>Dxm is also a nmda antagonist and serotonergic with confirmed antidepressant effects</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your response, and I understand that scientists are able to observe the ups and downs of various chemicals in the brain.  And that we have SOME understanding of what these chemicals signal/do.  </p>

<p>But in the example of ketamine when researchers used rapamycin pre-treatment to inhibit mtor1c they found that opposite their hypothesis, the antidepressant effects were prolonged significantly.    </p>

<p>This is why I say it is very complicated and not easily explained by textbook chain of logic as you&#39;ve presented - even by people like yourself who are very knowledgeable on the topic.  There is too much that we don&#39;t know to make broad assumptions.  And overconfidence is dangerous.  You must know this, within the supplement field there are thousands of contradicting studies and many articles stating &quot;facts&quot;.</p>

<p>An amazing drug like cardarine has a famous study showing how it promotes cancerous tumor growth in mice (or rather these specific ko mice) and was dropped by the company, but is still widely sold and there is no indication of cancer in people... Though maybe it does.   But how exactly?  We do not know.  </p>

<p>If we truly understood neurochemistry and pharmacodynamics then animal studies would be irrelevant and we would already have the perfect drugs with no side effects.  Basically every novel drug that hits the market is an educated experiment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s multiple ways to explain the article you posted and none of them include the lack of involvement from mTOR, BDNF or AMPA. This is because genetic deletion of TrkB or TrkB antagonism abolishes the antidepressant effect of ketamine, and same with AMPA.</p>

<p>The first and most logical explanation is that the rapamycin dose was not enough to reverse the BDNF enhancement by ketamine. Rapamycin has a hard time getting into the brain. And while it may eventually accumulate and begin to inhibit mtor this would only counteract the bdnf plateau by ketamine, which may improve treatment. Note that the acute antidepressant effect of ketamine was not altered.</p>

<p>The second is that mtor induction plays an entourage effect with the other mechanisms I mentioned: serotonin promotion and nr2b induction.</p>

<p>So yeah I&#39;m not following this rhetoric that nobody understands what does what. We aren&#39;t living in the 1950s anymore. Trial and error exists but it&#39;s not as problematic as it was then. We know a lot more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your detailed explanation and it indeed sheds light on the intricate biochemical interactions at play, particularly concerning ketamine&#39;s antidepressant effects. Your grasp on the mechanisms involving mTOR, BDNF, and NR2B is commendable. However, there are a few points where I think further clarification or evidence might be needed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Rapamycin Dose and BDNF Enhancement</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The precise dosage of rapamycin and its efficacy in reversing BDNF enhancement by ketamine seems to be a complex issue. While the study we are discussing did administer rapamycin, the exact interplay between its dosage and BDNF enhancement wasn&#39;t fully elucidated. This leaves room for further investigation to understand the dose-dependent effects of rapamycin on BDNF enhancement by ketamine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>mTOR Induction, Serotonin Promotion, and NR2B Induction (Entourage Effect)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The concept of an &#39;entourage effect&#39; involving mTOR, serotonin, and NR2B is intriguing. While there is evidence showing individual interactions between these elements, the collective entourage effect as you suggested, isn&#39;t directly substantiated in the available literature. The interactions among serotonin, mTOR, and NR2B seem to be more nuanced and may require a more detailed exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Genetic Deletion of TrkB or TrkB Antagonism Abolishing Ketamine&#39;s Antidepressant Effect</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>This claim aligns well with established mechanisms and underscores the central role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in mediating ketamine&#39;s antidepressant effects.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Your hypothesis presents a well-argued understanding of the potential mechanisms, and I agree with much of what you&#39;ve presented. However, the complexities of neurochemical interactions, as well as the sometimes unpredictable outcomes observed in pharmacological interventions, suggest a cautious approach in interpreting these mechanisms. The discussion indeed highlights the nuanced and sometimes elusive nature of neuropharmacology, and the need for continued research to unravel these intricacies. The field is ever-evolving, and discussions like these contribute to a broader understanding and hopefully, better therapeutic interventions in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with both of you here while we shouldn&#39;t dismiss evidence; Mechanistic data should be used as hypothesis generating which may be used to conduct trials. It&#39;s NOT mechanistic data then make conclusions. Of course in order to propose any cause and effect relationship you need to prelude it with a hypothesis which we get from past empirical observations. Mechanistic explanations while useful for hypothesis generating, should stay at that. If you don&#39;t stay at that you may end up drawing a false conclusion which may have drastic consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what your angle is here. You make your hypothesis via the mechanism, then prove it to the best of the ability - then what? No conclusion?</p>

<p>Your framing doesn&#39;t leave room for a conclusion no matter how much we know about a mechanism through repeated results.</p>

<p>Whereas isolating mechanisms and founding an understanding on what they do is the basis of pharmacology.</p>

<p>Things can change over time, and they usually do, but that doesn&#39;t account for how much neuroscience as a whole has adapted and adjusted itself.</p>

<p>You know, being indecisive out of fear of being wrong also has consequences sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am hesitant to take Neboglamine. Due to still being on Adderall which is well established as excitotoxic to cells with the NMDA  receptor and glutamatergic pathways. Neboglamine seems like it would exacerbate that?<br/>
What about TAK-653, piracetam, etc? I am new to much of this info and not really familiar with how moderate to high prescription doses of amphetamine (30 to 60mg of Adderall) affect and may or may not damage AMPA related pathways. So don&#39;t know if AMPA PAMs like these are a bad idea or not for people like me on Adderall. I know Adderall has damaged the heck out of my brain and endocrine system already.  Or if a good or bad idea on days I am off Adderall?</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Should also mention I am also taking modafinil/armodafinil, strattera, memantine, noopept,and a bunch of supplements. And some other drugs for course durations sometimes like mexidol, afobazole.</p>

<p>Currently have Bromantane. Sometimes take phenylpiracetam, sunifiram. </p>

<p>Have tried Tak-653, Tropisetron, PRL-8-53, NA-selank, NA-semax, idra-21 (never again idra-21 gave me a wicked bad rash). Can&#39;t say for sure if they had any effect or not. So downregulated/damaged from Adderall that not much is noticeable. And taking so many other things daily, hard to tell what does and does not have an effect. </p>

<p>Had a prescription for Vraylar which was horrible. Made me sleepy but wouldn&#39;t let me sleep. And lasted a few days. Even on low dose. Therapist was incompetent anyway and had my doubts about about a mood stabilizer. How well does a mood stabilizer really work when things are too damaged? Not enough of the pathways to stabilize was my thoughts. And was misdiagnosed in 5 minutes anyway.</p>

So my most basic take on NooTopics is that if we&#39;re going to overclock our brains, we&#39;re going to have to do it with at least a dozen supplements，Some are responsible for enhancing benefits, while others are responsible for offsetting disadvantages.. If there are only several supplements, it will be difficult to improve some functions without causing a decrease in other functions.</p>
