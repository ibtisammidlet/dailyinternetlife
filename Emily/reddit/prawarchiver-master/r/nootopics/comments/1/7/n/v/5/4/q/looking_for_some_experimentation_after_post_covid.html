        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all,
Veering into this subreddit at someone’s suggestion to ask about a very speciric issue.
I feel that post covid my libido ( and to some extent motivation and to some extent memory ) have been affected negatively. Or course, no one really believes me as they don’t know amyone else with this kind of side effects ( me neither) but it’s been an year and i feel is time for me to try ti be pro active.</p>

<p>My blood work is great. So my research and conckusion is that, well, must be something related to dopamine and serotonine. Dunno which. Perhaps inflammation too.</p>

<p>I am not sure how to proceed as i am also very scared of side effects so i want to take it slowly and evaluate in small steps.</p>

<p>But where to start?
Any suggestions from people who maybe understand these things better?
I say i need ti start taking something that will help my dopamine and see how i respond, but what? </p>

<p>I have a prescription for bropotitone from  my doctors But he just said that i descriebe depression whereas i thibk is related to covid as the symptoms started after it.</p>

<p>Please be kind to me as i am actually very scared there is nothing i can do and honestly it sucks to not be as hornt as i used ti be and doubt that my brain is as it wasbefore..</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was some research, that so called long corona disease may actually essentially to do with mitochondrial malfunction among other things. This would explain strange nature of this thing, where is hard to get grip on and which can manifest itself in so numerous ways. Probably microcirculation damage what was connected with most earliest virus variants, and chronic neuroinflammation could be connected or actually intertwined in self-feeding loop with aforomentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check this out, as it also points into mito dysfunction theory. “the chronic disease [of COVID] is due to changes in the metabolism of tryptophan and the lack of niacin (NAD/NADH+).” <a href="https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-7-195.php?jid=jide&amp;s=09">https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/jide/journal-of-infectious-diseases-and-epidemiology-jide-7-195.php?jid=jide&amp;s=09</a></p>

<p>Also thiamine in various forms in essential in mithocondrial energy production, so this would make logic from that perspective. And that idea makes sense to add even more mito energy production co-factors - very same to fight aging if this mito connection with long corona symptoms is largely true. <a href="https://www.hormonesmatter.com/recovering-from-long-covid-with-thiamine/">https://www.hormonesmatter.com/recovering-from-long-covid-with-thiamine/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>NADH also matters for dopamine &amp; serotonin production. If there is severe lack of NADH (connected say with alcoholism as its metabolism burns it away, but downlooked element of it). At least earlier intravenous NADH was been researched for Parkinson patients with success, and also with substance abuse problems both connected with dopamine output. Nowadays intravenous is no more needed as there has emerged some forms of NADH what do absorb from capsule form, and as far as I have understood NMN, Niacin in megadoses, NR and all the rest of NAD+ precursos should be capable to do the same. </p>

<p>So what is mentioned as a theory of NAD+ factor behind long covid symptoms, this would also explain its connection to lack of dopamine. </p>

<p>Also any sort of inflammation instantly drops dopamine levels as we all have experienced. And those symptoms can be felt with longcovid, although sometimes not there but even smallest physical effort one day may make you feel as if you had run marathon or drank heavily previous day (as I felt) what again points out to possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Inflammation as such alone can be treated with some supplements, like PEA if it would help for dysforia, as in this case I do not believe that NAC style antioxidant upregulation alone would help if inflammation is of viral origin. Some other supplements as well may have directly inflammation suppressing impact coupled with antioxidant propensities, and something like alpha-lipoic acide or preferably R-lipoic acid sodium stabilized could be tried as it was able to suppress inflammation independent of antioxidant effects, along with being cofactor with numerous mitochondrial energy production processes. I guess rather big stack of everything connected with these directions to look at would be worthwile trying, coupled just with things that enhance micro-circulation (like Gingko, or microdosing Aspirin).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am thankful but I do not understand much. I will take NAM ( or NAC?), i am also ordering Curcumin and Garlic extract ( for inflammation etc ) but I am not suee what else tou suggest here cause most if what you wrote kind kf went over my head :)
So if tou suggest any supplements specifically would be grateful ( i usually buy from NootropicDepot ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is NAM?</p>

<p>Garlic has blood thinning impact, and may aid with microcirculation if that is damaged. </p>

<p>There are only just pre-supposements what is wrong with long covid disease, and it is also political thing; it is not wanted to admit that it exists no matter how much casualties are, so the blame is on the sick people what is wrong. But then again symptoms are very diverse, may be highly different with different people and seemingly different variants of virus created different impact. Earliest and most deadliest Wuhan variant seemingly ruined your microcirculation system among other things, which is detrimental for brains dependant on it. Late Omicron variants mostly just inflammation-related tiredness, amotivation, and dysforic feelings are just there what seem to be related to high inflammation what creates low dopamine levels. </p>

<p>Good curcumin extract was one of herbal stuff what could block some inflammation signalling directly beyond being also that via antioxidant way, so that may be too good choice to start with and then to extend stack when seeing one by one what is reaction to those added there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant NMN. 
I had omicron. I mostly just feel rhat my motivation was affected and my libido lowered and maybe some memory issues. Im also 40+ so age definitely is part of it.
I’m gonna try NMN, curcumin, garlc and micro dosing aspiring ( what would you say is microdose?). And looking to get other things down the line like R-ALA etc. before trying some dopamine pharma meds directly. My general feeling is that I need a little helo but who can tell, as you say, it’s not very discussed and hopefully more research wil go into it in time.
Thank you for your input!</p>
