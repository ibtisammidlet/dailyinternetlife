        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I stumbled upon that on the 2023 16th of August, apparently, Nootropics Depot and MisterYouAreSoDumb personally got charged by the US Department Of Justice with a criminal case. Centera Bioscience (ND company) got 1 count and the general manager 2 counts due to something.</p>

<p>I tried to access the court documents via PACER (a federal system that should allow to access court documents of US cases) but I can&#39;t get through their paywall for some reason, which could be due to the fact my billing card isn&#39;t attached to the US address. The cost should be only $0.1/page or $3 per document, so a total of ~3-9$ to get this information. Can anybody register an account on PACER, enter New Hampshire&#39;s court-specific PACER page, and search by the case number <em>1:23-cr-00069</em>?</p>

<p>New Hampshire&#39;s court PACER page: <a href="https://ecf.nhd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl">here</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Obviously, posting this to <a href="/r/nootropics">/r/nootropics</a> subreddit, got my post immediately removed... I suppose other people also tried to find out earlier but could not due to the censorship. The subreddit is heavily moderated by ND itself with full-time paid moderators to make sure the public perception about nootropics is as malformed towards the benefit of ND as possible, so as far as I know, even talking about the research of novel nootropics is prohibited as well. I&#39;ve seen people getting banned if they post about anything that could divert attention from ND&#39;s &quot;safe and ineffective&quot; herbal powders for 3-6x the cost of what you can get from EU companies with equivalent or better testing. Shame how disspirited and complacent people can become, making millions of dollars and not even once producing anything new that isn&#39;t already mass-produced by big Chinese manufacturers (that every single supplement company in the world resells from) years ago, only investing in ways to bait people with &quot;trendy&quot; marketing images and 0 creative potential of pioneer spirit that was essential to bring awareness of such a concept as &quot;nootropic&quot; into the minds of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preface - I&#39;m always the one in that company&#39;s subreddit trying to put into perspective how cringy/culty everyone appears. I feel half that subreddit would do misteryouaresodumb&#39;s laundry, just to show their &quot;gratitude&quot; for the quality control that nd promotes. It&#39;s sickening, they&#39;re a business, show your gratitude by opening your wallet. Quit trying to suck the dude&#39;s ****</p>

<p>Concession/rebuttal - that being said, nootropics depot does appear to have better than average quality control, and the staff does appear to genuinely have passion about their products (as vanilla as most of those products are). Additionally, some of their products are entirely unique. Some of their products are one of a kind extracts that you can&#39;t get anywhere else (credit where credit is due)</p>

<p>Reality - I literally take nothing from that company, not because I don&#39;t feel their quality control is up to par, but because I have no need for any of the (generally vanilla) products they offer, and they&#39;re not the only shop in town offering good-enough-quality-control on the stuff generic enough for them to sell. </p>

<p>Meta - I&#39;ve been banned from this subreddit for talking down about the owner of bromantane.co , who started this sub and had also stacked the mod team heavily in his favor. So, it appears there is nowhere completely unbiased to discuss nootropics directly on reddit. I would take that into consideration as well.</p>

<p>All that to say, nothing is coming up when I search that case number on Pacer. I need more information</p>

<p>Between in or about April 2017 and in or about December 2021, the defendants

    <div class="md"><p>Well two years ago this coming December most companies that sold racetrams received “warning letters” although I can’t recall the specifics. I was told the general gist of it was the way it was marketed however most places stopped selling Phenibut and racetrams right after that.  Just sold out their stock and done. Some places closed up shop. </p>

<p>Here you can read His crussade against Piracetam. This was published in 2020, so one year before the Piracetam ban started.

<p>This men has an obsessive and personal affair against nootropics. He was responsible for placing piracetam in the category of toxic and dangerous drug by the FDA.
It will be a relief for freedom and human progress when this guy stops bothering us with his sick obsession (for whatever reasons he disappears but he leaves soon!)</p>

<p>I tried posting about this on r/Phenibut and was told by the mod who mods both r/Phenibut and r/nootropics that they were not removing posts about this, and they actually then removed my post from r/Phenibut for not being specific enough. Which makes sense if what they said was true. Maybe Majalisk has no idea that they are removing posts. I don’t know how modding works or if you can remove posts without other mods knowing</p>

<p>Regardless this is awful, I’m not an ND fan boy but I feel bad for them for getting the DOJ on their ass. They weren’t marketing the stuff on their site as a supplement.</p>

<p>I understand this appears to be a subreddit for people who don&#39;t like Nootropics. I&#39;m pretty neutral I guess, except for the fast that I despise and do not support the “more regulation” movement. I think if someone wants to build a business working with Nootropics and chemicals that are not regulated or scheduled, and they are as careful as misteryouaresodumb is, which he is. The FDA should be attacking shady companies and vendors that do not third party test the stuff they sell, etc. Theyre attacking someone that has, as far as I have knowledge of, been very careful about ensuring the purity and safety of the things he sells. He seems to be pretty level headed about the decisions he makes? Unless I am missing something. This comment might end up getting downvoted. Specifically my anger is on the additional control that is being enforced. The charging documents specifically state that these things he was selling are considered prescription drugs, and that he is selling them without a prescription or valid prescribers license.</p>
