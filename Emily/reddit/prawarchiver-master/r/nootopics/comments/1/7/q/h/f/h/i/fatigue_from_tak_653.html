        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Day 4 on TAK. Only took moderate doses; 2mg for second day and 1mg on others</p>

<p>On the first day, I noticed being able to watch video lectures at faster speeds and manage to keep up. On day 2, I took 2mg and intense sleepiness was brought, but seemed to have improved reading speed by quite a margin; I took ~27 minutes on a reading comprehension set which usually takes 35~40min.
Its mood enhancing effects seemed greater than SSRI antidepressants until about this point too.</p>

<p>Every time I took this, the substance brought feelings of tiredness for 1.5~2 hours before fading out by itself. However, today I feel especially tired even 10 hours after taking it. Cognitive and mood benefits seemed to have largely abated at this point. </p>

<p>Most reviews on TAK I read were centered on 2mg dose and reported consistent benefits.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m now worried about the possibility that &quot;honeymoon phase&quot;of TAK has already ended for me. Also afraid to increase dose as it may bring even heavier drowsiness. Maybe I might skip dosing for tomorrow and see how it goes, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know if anyone has had similar experiences, and whether if TAK&#39;s positive effects could persist if I endure this initial phase.
Also, I&#39;m curious if taking TAK at night could reduce sleepiness the following day while retaining cognitive benefits. I also take an SSRI which also makes me tired if taken at morning, but taking it right before sleep seems to counteract drowsiness the following day while retaining mood elevation. However, I&#39;m unsure if same could be applied to TAK, as the mechanism of action is highly different. Though I read many anecdotes stating vivid dreams and increased REM sleep I&#39;d taken at night, I&#39;m primarily looking for cognitive enhancements during daytime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also feel slightly tired on doses between 1-4mg( only ones that I tested) . But it&#39;s worth it for me. I can concentrate much longer on it.</p>
