        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m glad I got the motivation to finally make a post of this magnitude. This is my strategy and projection for how I&#39;m going to try and live my life for the next couple of months at least. So, to start off I am not the stereotypical dumb person. I&#39;ve tested my IQ online several times with the CAIT v2, 1980s SAT, and the Ravens (although this one I only did the progressive matrices part or whatever its called). These are all relatively g-loaded tests of cognitive ability however they can&#39;t decipher how a person will function in life because they are not applicable to our function as a human interacting with the world around us. </p>

<p>My scores for mathematical IQ range from 111 on the 1980s SAT M, 119 PRI and 127 VSI on the CAIT and around 127 on the Ravens Progressive Matrices which makes sense because I&#39;ve always been in the top of my math classes in primary school without studying much and only started to struggle once I got to geometry because I never studied and couldn&#39;t just figure it out in my head naturally. So I can grasp math concepts quicker than the average person but not as fast as someone with my IQ should be able to which doesn&#39;t make sense at surface level. This is where I believe my language and memory shortcomings start to hinder my quantitative/math ability and my general higher order cognition. I struggle to remember many things in life (not basic information like my name or my address but things that I&#39;ve done, conversations, smaller details of my experiences which I generally don&#39;t pay attention to either, details in other people&#39;s lives that are relevant in everyday conversation/thought and just have a shit memory in general for everything basically). If you asked me questions about myself it would be hard to get more than a sentence or two out without me having to think about it for a bit. This sucks when trying to form connections and have conversations with people. </p>

<p>My VCI has varied from 86 on the CAIT 2.0 (which i think is unreliable because how would I ever do well on the general knowledge subtest when I have one of the worst memories of anyone I can think of) to 103 on the 1980s SAT verbal part. I took the verbal part of the CAIT about a month after my first test because I couldn&#39;t believe that my quantitative and verbal intelligence were more than 2 standard deviations apart and got a flat 100 upon retesting. This was much more believable and on par with my SAT score. I&#39;ve always struggled with reading and most things with language tied to it ever since I was a child. I was sent into an ESL class when I was 5 because I didn&#39;t understand English but supposedly had no issues up until then with speaking or language in my native language according to my mother and had no formal diagnoses of any disorders. I took these speech classes up until second grade when I graduated out of it before almost any of the other ESL students. This would give anyone the idea that I was smart because I learned the language quicker than other students in my class however I would still struggle up until 6th grade with reading writing at least grade wise. I got to a normal grade range around middle school and even got a couple remarks about being good at writing essays throughout high school. This made me think that the only thing I had was ADHD and I struggled to focus as I would always get in trouble for being a class clown and being extremely talkative and disruptive to my classes. Further, ever since kindergarten I would get easily distracted, had a short attention span and would constantly be distracting other class mates so I know I for sure have ADHD. I&#39;m medicated now although only started taking Adderall in college after realizing how big of a problem I had in daily function and realizing it wouldn&#39;t go away by becoming an adult (a lot of people think that kid&#39;s mental disorders go away in adulthood for some reason which is really fucked up and dangerous for the kids like me who don&#39;t receive treatment to fix their neurological problems in childhood and have to deal with the consequences in adulthood.) </p>

<p>My Cognitive Proficiency  Index on the CAIT was 127 (based off of Digit Span and Symbol Search subtests). This doesn&#39;t make sense because I feel like my working memory is horrible and my processing speed as well but maybe this means my memory is fine but my comprehension is bad which would indicate I am borderline level language wise and don&#39;t understand half the information that I process? I don&#39;t understand how I can have such a high memory score yet struggle with recalling information at the degree I do, it makes zero sense to me.</p>

<p>All this leads me down to the fact that I have a language disorder, possibly Mixed Expressive-Receptive Language Disorder along with my autism and adhd which aren&#39;t helping my case. I have not been formally diagnosed with any of these disorders fwiw.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My protocol to improve my fluid verbal/language based reasoning is:</p>

<p>Cardio (30 mins minimum daily, Zone 2): Improves hippocampal function while also increasing the size of the hippocampus and changing the structure of it. This is in hopes to add room for verbal crystallized intelligence. I also take Adderall, piracetam and vinpocetine which have side effects and you probably shouldn&#39;t engage in exercise while on Adderall but I really could care less at this point, at the moment i&#39;m taking anything that helps improve my performance, ill worry about the risks later on</p>

<p>Meditation: Increases size of hippocampus and supposedly increases working memory through structural changes</p>

<p>Dual-N-Back: 20 sessions a day minimum: has been shown in studies to increase verbal working memory and working memory in general; also increases functional connectivity in the default mode network which correlates with improved working memory.</p>

<p>Reading: in effort to improve reading comprehension and anything associated with speech and thought. Also going to have a dictionary on hand to look up any words I don&#39;t know and to help if I can&#39;t comprehend the context of a sentence I&#39;m reading. Also, this will hopefully increase my active vocabulary and thought speed/accuracy in describing my thoughts in words.</p>

<p>Relational Frame Training / Syllogimous v3: This is studied to increase fluid intelligence and reasoning abilities associated with language and cognition/thought in children through development. Hasn&#39;t been studied as much in adults but there is a high probability it can increase intelligence to a smaller degree.</p>

<p>Juggling: has been shown to increase grey matter in the brain, perception, and specifically hand-eye co-ordination and balance. Through this, the brain&#39;s processing speed can be increased sufficiently. Has also been shown to improve left-right hemisphere connectivity.</p>

<p>Nootropics: racetams, tak-653 (anecdotes proposing that it improves iq scores slightly and I can affirm it deepens some of my thoughts on it but this can just be placebo), bacopa monnieri, creatine, lions mane, vinpocetine, cerebrolysin, omega 3 (dha, epa); can boost neurotransmitters and cell function to a certain level improving brain function and intelligence a tiny bit through certain mechanism of actions although these changes aren&#39;t permanent and these are acute solutions. Nobody should rely on these solely if they are struggling with intellectual/learning disabilities</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Can anyone offer any insight on what condition/problem I might have? I would really appreciate it as I don&#39;t really have anyone to vent to and don&#39;t trust many people in my life to talk about this. I need some advice on how to deal with my situation because I feel like I am in an impossible situation where I smart but dumb at the same time, so there is such duality in my experience as a supposed &quot;intellectual&quot; person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A suggestion: if you are learning juggling just for the sake of improvement learn something you want instead. It&#39;s benefits are coming from new motor skill learning, fine tuning of hand eye coordination etc. A martial art, sport or musical instrument can provide same benefits. Martial art or sport can have the added benefit of extra cardio as well. If you like juggling ignore what I said and go for it. I just find learning something for the sake of its benefits, makes me unmotivated so I stop doing it in long term. Same suggestion for dual-n-back as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you for coming to the conclusion that taking care of yourself is the best route! trying to maintain optimal mental and physical health is definitely the only thing that’s going to improve your situation. Now, I want to encourage you to avoid testing your intelligence from now on. If you want to gauge wether or not your protocol is working I’d suggest engaging in intellectual stimulation outside of “cognitive testing” related subjects. learning about something more beneficial to your life is going to make you much happier. It might be useful to quit adderall if you feel a compelled to test your IQ on meds. If you’re abusing your meds, which I highly suspect, your significantly increasing your risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease (Parkinson’s). Not to mention your causing neural damage from either excitotoxicity or sleep deprivation or both. Please leave the cognitivetesting subreddit for your own sake. It’s not healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right about the fact that I shouldn’t be thinking about testing my intelligence anymore which I don’t really care about. There isn’t anything left for me to learn about my ability and that was the whole point of testing myself multiple times. IQ, or the lack thereof, is just the best way that I can explain my problem to others. I am letting life test me from now on and also trying to see how my learning improves in my classes which Im using to be able to tell if I am improving in any way. I am prescribed and pop at least 5mg adderall almost everyday, and 10-15mg for the two days of the week where I have school so if you consider this abuse then yes I’m an addict lol. I understand the risks of putting my cells in a excitotoxic state and how this can increase the risks of me developing Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, strokes or whatever but from what I’ve read, the risks of developing these aren’t increased by that much by adderall unless you are really overdosing on it and even then the research is fuzzy. Cerebrolysin repairs the brain either way from adderall damage or that’s at least how I understand it even though, like I said, I’m not abusing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you are fairly new to adderall and judging from the paragraphs you’re writing you probably do not need to be taking as much as you are… if you become accustomed to the euphoria you’ll eventually have to dose more so just be responsible and avoid the temptation to redose. The half-life is ridiculously long, leading me to strongly suspect long-term adderall use causes sleep-impairments resulting in neurodegeneration reduced working memory/general cognitive function, attention issues, and basically all the symtoms of ADHD. People with ADHD unless receiving adderall treatment have “attention” issues becuase they can’t focus without their meds because they develop dependence. They have poor working memories becuase adderall causes working memory impairments (espcially if you’re already an anxious person). People with ADHD often have trouble eating on their meds causing them to lose weight which reduces testosterone thereby reducing motivation, cognitive function, confidence. Adderall can cause gyno so I suspect it effects hormone profile negatively. It reduces your ability to solve complex problems but makes you more confident in your abilities while on it giving you a false sense of confidence/ability. It causes additional strain on your heart which is no good. Vasoconstriction reducing nutrients to the brain. </p>

<p>All I’m saying is if you’re looking to optimize your cognitive function to the utmost possible adderall isn’t going to be apart of that equation. </p>

<p>Meditating on adderall is ass. </p>

<p>Working out on adderall is potentially dangerous. </p>

<p>I have used this substance since I was 16 on and off up until now (22). It’s not a net positive. You’re better off without it. I often cycle off for several months at a time. </p>

<p>People will do anything to justify their addiction/dependence/infatuation with a drug, especially adderall. </p>

<p>I know it feels like it’s a wonder drug but it’s not. Anyways if you’re going to continue using it here are my recommendations. </p>

<p>These are extremely neuroprotective against any adderall-induced neurotoxicity and heart remodeling that may or may not occur: 
ALCAR 
ALA 
Taurine 
ECGC 
L-citruline
Selenium 
Vitamin D3/K2 
I recommend a multivitamin if food is an issue. Performance lab multi is fantastic 
Cognance 
Magnesium L-threonate 
Saffron </p>

<p>If you’re curious about any MoA/justification lmk I’ll provide research articles I’ve poured over hours and hours of research regarding this issue over the course of several years. I am actually considering making a YouTube video soon about how to properly stack with adderall to protect against any potential adverse effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually remember being on Adderall, and it did interfere with my sleep, and after about 5 days of taking it I would wake up exhausted and my body just begging for a day off (which I usually gave it.)</p>

<p>The temptation to chase the euphoria was difficult some days, but eventually euphoria was mostly gone unless I took a higher dose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I also have severe ADHD….since childhood too ….couldn’t even follow basic directions from the teacher, while every other child did.  Despite the ADHD I’m actually intelligent.</p>

<p>Adderall was a wonder drug at first, transformed my life, ADHD eliminated, but over time the side effects got worse, and the beneficial effects got less</p>

<p>I took a three year break but my life was falling apart unmedicated (despite doing everything else right..,,eg sleep exercise, diet, hydration, etc)</p>

<p>Now I’m on Dex-Methylphenidate…..it wears off surprisingly fast.  I can usually sleep just four hours after my last dose.  (I work second shift and regularly dose very late.)</p>

<p>It’s ~80% as effective as Adderall, but for the reduced side effects it’s worth it.</p>

<p>Still though, it causes a mood roller coaster throughout the day.</p>

<p>I’ve tried all kinds of nootropics to get off it, probably spent over $3,000, and some help, but not nearly enough.</p>

<p>For now I’ve just accepted I need the medication.  Part of me still hopes to find the perfect nootropic, but I doubt it.  </p>

<p>Such is life.  Methylphenidate does seem safer than Adderall though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never redose throughout the day and I do know the half life is around 12 hours for the XR meaning the effects last through the next day. My working memory is shot with or without my adderall and adderall slightly increases it so I’ll take what I can get. I do take a multivitamin, choline, sulforaphane and omega 3s to help my brain recover from all the stress adderall can put it through. However I don’t feel that it is as problematic as you think at a low dose. Obviously, it’s only been 2 months of semi-consistent use and it is by no means a wonder drug in my experience but I don’t think it will have long lasting effects if you take the right stuff to counter it. I also take vinpocetine, a vasodilator to prevent vasoconstriction a bit and exercise almost daily to help blood flow. I feel like it is genuinely a wonder drug for people that struggle with task initiation like me even though it does apparently slightly reduce cognitive ability while on it. I plan on trying other ADHD medications to see if they help just as much or more than adderall.</p>

<p>Being in a state of over nutrition (overweight) is much more likely to cause gyno.</p>

<p>But if Adderall is prevent you from eating so much that you are malnourished, stop taking it before you starve.</p>

It makes you more likely to develop nutritional deficiencies, and not eat sufficient amount of food for optimal health.

<p>Even the information on the meds will show you that, but they don’t give you the exact frequency of occurrence. </p>

<p>Do that snd youll agree. Or you’ll have the evidence to prove you are correct. But the side effect of weight loss does not mean malnutrition, nor does it mean that men grow breasts. </p>

<p>The weird part is that many side effects are as common with the placebo as with the Med.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>inteligence is mostly structural. Your brain is like any other part of the body. It can heal from a lot, back to being how it was like my hands, for example, after getting over my video game addiction I had joint damage, as long as I don&#39;t overuse them they feel good as new, but they don&#39;t hold up long like the used to. Similar to my brain, after trying a lot of risky nootropics, my brain is less resilient to stress. I recommend people just stick to prescription drugs and taking care of themselves. I&#39;ve learned a different perspective over the years, I&#39;m not supposed to be perfect or idolize and obsess over my own successes, I&#39;m supposed to do my best, breed and die, and the next generation gets a chance at being smarter. There. Are. No. Smart drugs. Except for what you need to make ypur brain more like everyone elses, and perhaps you can, but no one even knows how to diagnose things like that, even for prescription medications it&#39;s trial and error. You&#39;re going to damage your brain and not even know it before you find something that works if you do research chemicals and stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what else is structural? Memory. which. is. my. main. issue. There is proof that you can make structural improvements in your hippocampus for the better through things like meditation, dual-n-back, yoga, juggling, even reading (tiny amount of evidence suggesting reading can induce myelination and change brain structure IN ADULTHOOD; <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19829380/">study</a>). I also know that resting functional connectivity can be enhanced through some of these activities as well. My problem is that there are people that are borderline that have much, much better language ability than me which bothers me. I shouldn&#39;t be functioning this poorly as someone with my intelligence level, not in a egotistical way but on a logical level IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE. If I could describe my life to anyone with one sentence: I live in the duality of the super ADHD kid whos&#39; smart, on crack. I got hit with autism, adhd, developmental language disorder, some sort of motor skill disability, and a working memory disability. its like god was in heaven looking at me in the womb like &quot;yea give him everything except retardation, lets sit back with our popcorn and watch this shitshow unfold.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should like into Lostfalcos page he has a lot of good content in regards to increase intelligence. And also try experimenting with different light therapies mainly lux (Sunlight) and red light therapy. Nicotine, intranasal insulin, methylene blue, magnesium L-theronate, nefiracetam are all IQ enhancing compounds in my opinion. Additionally if you believe that you have autism you should focus on the gut microbiome, expelling toxins/heavy metals and enhancing neuroplasticity which is what cerebrolysin would do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always thought you can use “and” in the place of to and have never gotten in trouble for it. Obviously, this would be in a context where you’re making a statement. You wouldn’t be able to say “I’m going to try, to then leave.” But there are ways where you can use the word “and” to connect two verbs.
