        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen others ask this question, but have never gotten a response. I know that no one can give medical advice here, and I am not expecting that, but hoping someone can give me their anecdotal experience, or offer a scientific perspective? I&#39;m really wanting to try TAK-653. To me, it sounds like a complete game changer for my life, but I am currently taking 150mg Zoloft daily and 1800mg Gabapentin daily and want to make sure it is safe to take with TAK-653? I struggle severely with MDD and anxiety, with a previous history of substance abuse, and have never felt whole since becoming clean 3 years ago. Thoughts please?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a simplified view, TAK and gabapentin are opposites (pro vs anti calcium influx, excitatory vs inhibitory, pro vs anti neurogenic). Not necessarily a dangerous combination, but likely an ineffective and irrelevant one. Since you also deal with anxiety TAK probably isn&#39;t the best option at the moment,  neboglamine and/or tropisetron could be an option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was VERY interested in Neboglamine, myself. It also sounded very promising. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know where to find it except through Everychem, and they have no stock. What are your thoughts with either Tak-653 or Neboglamine being taken with an SSRI? I worry about toxicity or Serotonin Syndrome, or some other problem, even though I know these two meds have completely different modes of action. Anxiety much? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There shouldn&#39;t be any problem, if anything there&#39;s antidepressive synergy. For me both TAK-653 and neboglamine have been beneficial only for cognition so far though.</p>

<p>Sarcosine I think is in stock and shares similarities with neboglamine, if you&#39;re looking to try something immediately that&#39;s an option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t even really looked at Sarcosine before.  I just now looked at a couple of PubMed studies and sounds a little promising. Sounds like the seizure threshold is a little lower in this one, but maybe a good one to try. Looks like they also haven&#39;t done much study on it for depression, but for some reason they sure have been finding that antipsychotics help as an adjunct in depression. Have you tried it? I might. It&#39;s not that I necessarily want something now, but the Neboglamine doesn&#39;t give any idea how long it will be or if it will return, and I have no idea if there are any other suppliers. That&#39;s why initially I thought Tak might be a good alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an anecdotal report, not a medical advice:</p>

<p>I did not experience any negative interaction (no I traction at all) between TAK and the SSRI I used to take (Escitalopram). But the Escitalopram dose was very low (5 to 10mg)/ a day).</p>

<p>As far as I know, they work on completely different paths</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know Gabapentin, sorry.</p>
