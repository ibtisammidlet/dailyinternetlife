        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The main Question:</strong><br/>
Hello, Im wondering if you guys know how to upregulate GABA-B expression in any way shape or form? Can be regarding the receptors or endogenous synthesis etc.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>
This because I noticed that however it works.. Phenibut, related to Baclofen, cured me. But I&#39;d prefer avoiding potential harm, and addressing closer to the cause of low GABA-B expression would be even better.</p>

<p><strong><em>This ^ was pretty much all you&#39;d need to know</em></strong><em>, but if you like I go into more details about my specifics that might help further answering my question:</em></p>

<p><strong>How does Phenibut &#39;cure&#39; me?:</strong><br/>
<strong><em>-Positive influence:</em></strong> It normalises certain behavior; enables cognitive switching <em>(holding task related bifurcations in mind instead of linear hyperpolarization)</em>;</p>

<p>thus it makes me able to reevaluate my current thoughts/actions during a sustained task, preventing dysfunctional sustained behavior. This reevalution likely happens at intervals over longer times and at points when percieved reward becomes noticably low. Nornally reward only matters for initiation, so I can end up mindlessly continueing doing something, even when at some points I notice it might no longer be worth doing it. These points somehow do not trigger reevaluation of reward, that aspect of inhibitory control is lost.</p>

<p><strong><em>-High specificity:</em></strong> It does not have much other effects than the mentioned normalization of behaviour; It does not emotionally or recreationally feel desired in any percievable way; it likely is not as habit forming for me.<br/>
<strong><em>No side effects:</em></strong> Related to specificity; it does not seem to cause noticable side effects.<br/>
<strong><em>Inverse withdrawal:</em></strong> Related to specificity; I do not conciously experience any withdrawal signs, controversially I even notice it having continuous positive influence on my behavior in the days after a dosage.</p>

<p>What are some points/keywords/leads I have? (Regarding my specific deficits, beware of informational bias here):<br/>
-OCD/&gt;ADHD.<br/>
-Overactive: Insula.<br/>
-Fixated behaviors: Lacking task interference from Default Mode network on performing networks. <em>&#39;Sustains&#39; acting on tasks too long, &#39;obsrssions&#39;.</em><br/>
-Altough overexcitable, lacking anxious feelings/behaviors that are most commonly talked about. Noticably high Harm avoidance and low social anxiety.<br/>
-Likely some Frontal dysfunctions, as related to ADHD. (Which often has underactive regulations of inhibition, related to networks which include a2adregenic receptors, that might have a GABAergic cause and effect).   </p>

<p>-Underactive: Ventral Vagal/parasympathetic, but bias towards hypoventilation(maybe even -&gt;hypoxia) instead of assumptiously more stress related hyperventilation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Receptor level: lithium orotate, fasoracetam. (Caffeine and nicotine also, likely irrelevant though).</p>

<p>Gene expression: selank and its more potent successors.</p>

<p>Other mechanisms but comparable subjective effects + other advantages: neboglamine, tropisetron. </p>

<p>Having tried all these, phenibut, and more - I&#39;d say NA-selank and tropisetron work the best. Assessing lithium right now for GSK3 inhibition and post accutane syndrome, but it feels like it <em>might</em> be showing some signs of GABAB upregulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oke thanks! Beware of that lithium can be very dangerous in certain combinations.</p>

<p>Semax didn&#39;t do much for me, could selank be much different? Tropisetron is not something I do notice, but maybe its really subtle, theoretically it seems to be something qualitatively relevant for me. Neboglamine made me tired, i think its because of gaba-a. I don&#39;t smoke(nicotine). </p>

<p>I do like fasoracetam, although it is really suble, I do notice it works qualitatively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, it merits some precautions for sure.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible you respond stronger to selank, they are derived from two different compounds at least (ACTH v tuftsin). The n-acetyl version was much stronger to me, to the point it nearly had recreational value. Noticed quite a bit less from semax comparatively. </p>

<p>I got some fatigue around the time I was trying out neboglamine but never attributed them to each other, interesting. I wasn&#39;t aware it had GABAA implications? It certainly felt more like being exhausted than being sedated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I made a terribly bad blunder for my standards lmao. I somehow mixed up Neboglamine with Nefiracetam, because I read you mention Fasoracetam, which made me hold Nefiracetam in mind by mean of associative memory, of which the words seem similar enough at first glance</p>

<p>I did also try Nebaglomine (next to Nefiracetam). Nebaglomine did not have any noticable effect on me at any dose</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s possible you respond stronger to selank</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm, oke than I will test it! Does it also hold impactful risks like hair loss with semax, or is it generally safe?</p>

<p>Every personally novel anti-stress mechanism is of interest to be explored. As stress and perfetionism are more impactfully limiting me than &#39;intellegence&#39;. I often tend to respond differently or not respond at all with these kind of things (with phenibut being the exception)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does cause some semi permanent damage. But, it will get better, I promise. Not to discount what you went through, any withdrawal is the hardest thing someone will go through in their life. But, that being said; Barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol are the worst withdrawals out there in that order. GHB would be next, then phenibut and other gaba b drugs. And all that being said opioids are after all of those. And uppers after that. People that use uppers don&#39;t understand how much misery people go through who have an addiction to depressants. People also don&#39;t understand that the withdrawals from gaba substances do cause semi permanent damage to the central nervous system. They also don&#39;t understand that the withdrawals from ANY depressants cause SIGNIFICANT trauma. Which needs to be healed. Lol all that being said, people who have abused uppers get physical lessons in their brain from the excess dopamine traveling into the parts of the brain where it shouldn&#39;t be. With all that being said, DRUGS SUCK lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man. Well I stopped benzos when I was arrested lol. Well, muscimol is a gaba a agonist and apparently has promise with with gaba a withdrawal. Bacopa upregulates gaba a receptors. But, if you&#39;re not wanting to go to a detox center. Then I would advise you to look up a beno taper schedule and stick to it. But, I would recommend a detox center at the end of the day because it&#39;s just so dangerous and I wouldn&#39;t want my advice to end in a bad way in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s the permanent damage? Just out of curiosity. </p>

<p>Also I’m 7 months no-booze. I’d gone through minor alcohol withdraws 2-3 times after some heavy 3-5 day “drink the whole time” benders. I have to say, the WD from phenibut was worse IME. Like… 3-4 days of “this is only getting worse,” no end in sight, skin crawling feeling, worst anxiety  ever… and no sleep. It felt like alcohol WD but up two levels. And then suddenly just vanished day 5. Could be my experience, but I thought phenibut was worse than alcohol. I can’t imagine benzos being even worse… scares me to think about. No free lunches out there - everything seems to have its repercussions</p>

<p>I read that a lot. Somehow I don&#39;t notice an emotional/rewarding or perceptive difference with ohenibut or sober. I wonder if I&#39;d be a fool to think that that might think it works differently for me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you specifically mention IN?</p>

<p>I do have fasoracetam, which I&#39;ve used orally at times. It was really subtle, but most substances I don&#39;t even notice any difference with, so I guess I can&#39;t expect more quantitatively of it. Qualitatively I seem to like it, altough the low noticability of the effects make it heard to analyse in detail</p>
