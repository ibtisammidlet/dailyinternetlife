    <div class="md"><p>I leave them up honestly because it builds SEO for the subreddit, even if only I and a few others ever bother to publish something in depth</p>

<p>The fast track to learning pharmacology was an attempt at inspiring people to make more educated statements and questions, but it&#39;s 2023 and peoples attention span is just awful</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to have other high value posters, but those types of people want the larger reach of other subreddits and platforms, even if in the case of r/Nootropics they might get perma banned over trivial reasons down the road</p>

<p>It will only really kick into high gear when I or someone else shifts focus towards growing the subreddit, but for some reason or another something goes wrong everywhere else so I&#39;m left constantly attending to the barrage of attacks </p>

<p>I have asked others if they were interested in taking a moderator position, but when I broke the news that it entails actual work like promoting NooTopics, they stopped caring</p>

<p>It likely won&#39;t expand much more than it has been until I get a grip on life and build the NooTopics app which will crosslink with reddit and possibly discord simultaneously. I don&#39;t really trust the admins to have my good intentions at heart, with them suspending my account on one occasion for simply selling Bromantane. I need to actually own the community, yaknow, otherwise it&#39;s at risk of collapse</p>

<p>Nevertheless I haven&#39;t given up on the idea of the NooTopics app. It will come... eventually</p>

<p>That said, there are several posts by <a href="/u/sirsadalot">/u/sirsadalot</a> that I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing pinned. The fast track to pharmacology is a start, but perhaps some of these (in order of importance to those new to this sub):</p>

<p>Also despite the annoyance and repetition of similar questions being asked, they can also catch different people/time-zones that missed the originals and can add plenty of new perspectives, experiences, and questions to the discussion.</p>

<p>And with a majority of us dealing with RC’s and fringe nootropics, any experience and course-correction against side-effects is worth many times over the slight iffiness of a repost :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the only downside of Reddit is that information about a certain topic can be kind of smeared out over numerous tiny pieces, while in the &#39;ol days on a forum you&#39;d just continue in the same thread. Sometimes you search for sth and you get 30 threads and they all contain 1 or two replies. Can take a while to sift through.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t know any solution to that directly, except it might be an idea to work together on a kind of Nootopics wiki where we can accumulate the most important info. If new threads with new revelations then come we could condense it into the wiki so it won&#39;t disappear in a pile of noise. It can start real simple by just listing noots and their pharmacokinetic parameters, dosage, ROA&#39;s, most common effects / reports etc.</p>
