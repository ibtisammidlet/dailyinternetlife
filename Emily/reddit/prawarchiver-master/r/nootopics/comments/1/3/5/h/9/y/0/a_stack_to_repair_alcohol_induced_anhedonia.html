I&#39;ve been using NAC to help ween down and I&#39;ve cut back significantly. I have ADHD and alcohol just helps calms my brain down. Allows me to sleep, I actually feel better the morning after drinking.</p>

<p>I currently take an SNRI for depression and have done for several years which has helped to an extent, SSRI&#39;s made my anhedonia 10x worse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that often with people who abuse alcohol, the issue is a reduction in GABA and an excess in Glutamate.</p>

<p>Anyone in a similar position found anything that works??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. I was a heavy drinker myself until about 2 years ago. I was also convinced It had caused neurological damage as like you, I was severely anhedonic, majorly depressed and anxious. I stopped completely and haven’t had a drink since though. Immediately after stopping I picked up exercising and healthy eating, a fixed sleep schedule, and in about 6 months I was feeling a lot better. I was still depressed and anxious though, so at that time I did a 4 week run of Cerebrolysin, Cortexin and NSI-189 and those definitely helped a lot. I must stress that it makes no sense to try to heal brain damage if you are actively still damaging your brain though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/BurkeAbroad has a very detailed and informative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/oqxy45/hangover_prevention_formulation_i_made_costs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1">post</a> about this in r/nootropics that has all the information you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Edit: I know his post is a “hangover prevention” guide but if you really dig through it he uses all the available data and talks about which supplements are to “prevent a hangover” and which supplements are really for repairing the damage in the brain. Something like l-theanine is great if you are actually drinking as it helps break down alcohol in the liver, but isn’t really gonnna do anything to “repair” any damage. Just give it a read. It’s really great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get your shit together &amp; stop drinking. Either this, or soon you are going to be too stupid to even be able to read this subreddit, let alone draw independent conclusions. If I were you, I&#39;d be fearing for my life <em>that alcohol will dumb me down and turn me into amoeba</em>. Sorry for not being sensitive but you know how it is. You have got one shot. Either be happy or become a fucking shell of your former self. So you either completely drop alcohol and start regimen of NAC, l-theanine in matcha tea, magnesium, or <strong>your life is done</strong> at this point. And god save if you if there is anything beyond this life. Because if there is, and if you keep drinking, you are going to end up in infinite anguish for eternity, <strong>no matter the religion/metaphysical framework</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until you quite entirely you’re going to have a nearly impossible time moving the dial Ime. Especially if you’re drinking daily and occasionally binge drinking. That said you’re best bet is with exercise, diet and things like meditation and cold showers. Probably not what you wanted to hear but it’s my experience</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans actions and thoughts are impacted by fear of pain, even if subconsciously. The way cold showers change the relationship of a human to pain is overlooked. Why is it overlooked? Because capitalism is not able to sell cold showers, so not many is going to force cold showers down your throat as part of a marketing campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pieces of the puzzle might be</p>

<p>flush niacin, low dose naltrexone, sulbutiamine/benfotiamine, activated charcoal, nebulized/liposomal glutathione (im a NAC skeptic), emoxypine, pregnenolone sublingual (resensitizes gaba, neurosteroid), skullcap. </p>

<p>i think ive read taking NAC in the vicinity of alcohol, such as the morning after, is really bad for the liver.  i think it can also chelate important nutrients and erode mucosal membranes</p>

<p>skullcap is good in many ways (gaba, serotonin, dopamine and more) but it would be a funny sort of drinking preventative.  skullcap reliably causes nightmares when combined with alcohol.  sometimes i take it early so i cant entertain the idea of drinking later</p>

<p>magnesium biases things towards gaba, away from glutamate, but balance is important and too much mg will lower dopamine.  mag glycinate, mgcl topical, mag malate are pretty good.  i used to think of magnesium a metaphorical engine coolant for the brain, but too much and its like you never get</p>

<p>i used to be a total skeptic but extended fasts, 2-3 days or more, are pretty powerful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apigenin increases GABA, modulates glutamate, increases NAD+, acts as a mu/delta/kappa opioid receptor antagonist, restores liver function, and a slew of other benefits— which hits a large portion of alcohol related trauma/addiction (especially with NAC added.)</p>

<p>With NAC, it prevents alcohol’s rewarding actions while restoring aberrant NMDA function (which is where addiction pathway is rooted), and has a long half-life— meaning you can take it before bed for incredible sleep, sleep through the minor starting discomfort of the opioid antagonism, and wake up refreshed with more endorphin activity on fresh receptors like LDN.</p>

<p>NAD+ nasally is also incredible at dealing with addictions, and alcohol especially lowers brain content of NAD+.</p>

<p>Also just on the off chance , but have you found that hangovers leave you feeling less depressed, more driven, and just generally more “human” again?</p>
