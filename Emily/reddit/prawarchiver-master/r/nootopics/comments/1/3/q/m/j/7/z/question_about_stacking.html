    <div class="md"><p>Hi! Created this account so I could comment on this post.  </p>

<p>I also enjoy the benefits of taking TAK and bromantane daily. I combine them with agmatine and neboglamine. </p>

<p>For context, I used to be on very high doses of stimulants for ~ 7 years. Then switched to modafinil (which I take on occasion but not often), which couldn&#39;t really help me the way the stims did. The above 4 compounds together, though, have transformed my personal, social and professional life.  </p>

<p>Neboglamine feels similar to TAK and taking them together, in my first person experience, just makes me even better cognitively. Agmatine has been a wonderful addition, as it has helped greatly with my ability to socialize, handle unexpected and unwanted &quot;surprises&quot;, etc.  </p>

<p>The first three (bromantane, TAK, and Nebo) improved motivation, focus and ability to synthesize thoughts, solve problems, and hold larger problems &quot;in my mind&quot; (working memory, I suppose). They didn&#39;t do as much for me in terms of sociability, flexibility, etc. Agmatine topped it off nicely as it made me a nicer person to myself and others, haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for this, absolutely LOVE modafinil but it&#39;s a bit too much sometimes even if I only take 100mg. Keeps me up. I believe in taking min effective dose and sporadically. Got some TAK, trying 4mg today and I notice studies used 6mg so will try that. Really want to aid my executive function as well. Also trying mantra meditation and seeing how it goes!</p>

<p>I used to have a vyvanse script back in high school but not trying to use amphetamine like that daily. Meh. Prefer coffee/noots/kratom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good writeup, but I&#39;d strongly disagree that Neboglamine feels similar to TAK. It&#39;s a very interesting substance with definite potential.</p>

<p>That said, I ultimately gave up on TAK, as it just made me feel &quot;off&quot; in an unpleasant way. I suspect this was due to the known issues many seem to have with THC/cannabis use and TAK.</p>

<p>I have nothing against it, definitely think it&#39;s worth a try. I liked Nebo quite a lot initially, but it seems to have stopped producing acute effects. I&#39;d try higher dosages (typically take 40-50mg oral), but if that&#39;s necessary it&#39;s financially unsustainable for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting - how would you characterize the differences between tak and nebo?</p>

<p>To me, they have similar stimulatory feeling. However, I am able to distinguish them from each other; nebo has an obvious emotional component to it (for me) where I actually FEEL like I’m doing better, whereas TAK is very strictly cognitive in the sense that it is obvious to me that I am more articulate, more creative, better able to form connections between concepts, etc. While I also experience this from Nebo, I do not seem to experience the last benefit “connecting ideas” quite as much from Nebo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, sorry :/ I guess because of the significant difference it has made it my life (and as a corollary, my earning power) it feels cheap for “what I get” in return.
