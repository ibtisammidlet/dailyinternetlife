        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this topic has been revisited several times. But I would like to know your opinion and experience. Stimulants fix me, BUT, they also make me depressed when it wears off and cause addiction. I don&#39;t like the idea of ​​having to take something EVERY TIME I need to be helpful/sociable. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not against medication, my problem is drugs that you need to take all the time to feel good when you take them. I am a fan of medications that you can take daily and that have a cumulative effect, like Wellbutrin for example. I already took it, but it didn&#39;t help me with the adhd issue.</p>

<p>I know there is healthy eating, less sugar, organization (all the things Andrew Hurbman talks about), but I live a very healthy life and I&#39;ve done everything to try to get better, but it seems that my brain has a problem. Extremely anxious and forgetful, clear social anxiety from the adhd (stimulants cure it).</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know how far I&#39;ll be able to get away from the meds. Is there a way to cure it with drugs other than conventional stimulants? I&#39;ve tried several nootropics with no effect.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m even thinking about trying a MAOI because of its dopaminergic properties, many people say it can be stimulating without being addictive. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a stimulant in all but name. Causes reynauds, can cause hyper tension etc. sane with bupropion/Welbutrin. Norepinephrine is one of the strongest vassopressors that exists in the universe: drugs that raise it are basically stimulants. It might not have the same severity of withdrawal as amphetamine but physiological effects in the body it’s very similar. Worsened my PTSD dissociation like whoa. Lost orientation to time et. Continuous uncontrolled flashbacks. Dopamine is not as bad in this regard as noradrenaline, although likewise pure dopamine infusion is also the first line drug in the ICU to keep otherwise dead hearts pumping lol. There is evidence of dopaminergenic medicine improving ptsd not of noradrenic medicine—effexor is a exception as it it’s only weakly an NRI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this is incorrect. Dopamine isn’t a first line agent for hypotension or shock, norepinephrine is. Dopamine causes an increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, where norepinephrine just causes vasoconstriction. Dopamine nearly doubles the risk of arrhythmia when administered to hypotensive patients instead of norepinephrine. </p>

<p>Dopaminergic drugs have higher risk of psychosis and mania, specifically in patients with ptsd and/or bipolar disorder. Adrenergic agents are not generally associated with triggering mania or psychosis. NRIs have been used to treat depression, anxiety, ptsd, schizophrenia, ADHD, and general cognitive dysfunction. </p>

<p>Bupropion is also not a clinically significant NRI. It lacks tyramine response associated with NRI activity. It is a NDRA with weak NDRI activity, just like amphetamine. It’s antidepressant efficacy over amphetamine is likely due to its weaker profile and antagonism of nACHR + 5HTc receptors.</p>

<p>NRIs do have a similar side effect profile to stimulants though. At therapeutic dosage, stimulants are biased towards norepinephrine release over dopamine release.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the prefrontal cortex, which doesn&#39;t have dopamine transporters and relies on NET for dopamine transport. Methylphenidate binds about three times more strongly to DAT than NET, those two facts combined are precisely why atomoxetine would raise dopamine more in the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wasn&#39;t even comparing to atomoxetine, it wouldn&#39;t even matter if atomoxetine raised dopamine for than methylphenidate -- it could still be the case and indeed is that Methylphenidate works more strongly on the dopaminergic system that the noradrenaline</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that at therapeutic dosing both methylphenidate and amphetamine disproportionally affects prefrontal catecholamines. As dose increases it starts affecting other regions. This should inherently bias them towards increasing adrenergic neurotransmission at low therapeutic dosing.<br/>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16806100/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16806100/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23303075/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23303075/</a></p>

<p>I found a few using microdialysis to analyze monoamine concentration in various brain regions after administering MPH. However, they all used doses greater than 1mg/kg. That would have most adults(averaging 60kg-80kg) taking 70mg or more, which seems rather high IMO. These studies all do show a significant increase in striatal dopamine.</p>

<p>Lol yeah that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother level of craziness imo. I understand it works well (doubt I&#39;ll ever know), assuming you prep it correctly, but nah.

    <div class="md"><p>idk if i agree with that. different infrastructure may call for different solutions for improving attention than a neurotypical brain, but it doesnt mean there is no solution. for example, in another comorbid disorder i have (pmdd), poor flexibility in GABAa regulation has been identified as a causative mechanism. thus, solutions involve targeting those receptors in different ways to combat symptoms. for adhd, obviously just ‘more dopamine’ is unlikely to improve symptoms, but it doesnt mean we cant see marked improvements with the right molecules.</p>

My time management, prioritization, task initiation, and organizational skills don&#39;t improve on stimulants. What <em>does</em> improve is focus and productivity.</p>

<p>Stimulants simply allow me to get more work done, but not necessarily the right kind of work. They improve some aspects of executive function, but don&#39;t touch the meat of the issue. Same with non-stimulants. Over time (especially combined with therapy) this can change, but acutely it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Why? Because there is literally infrastructure that a neurotypical has which an ADHD individual doesn&#39;t. This isn&#39;t just some abstract concept. A neurotypical when working has an intuitive sense for their executive function. Some part of their mind can <em>feel</em> how much time has passed and can <em>feel,</em> in comparison, how much time they should be spending.</p>

<p>They can <em>feel</em> in the back of their mind when what they&#39;re focusing on isn&#39;t important. They even have a whole map of how their day needs to go, constantly sitting there in the periphery of their awareness, keeping them on track. And they compare their progress to their plan, intuitively improving and changing it, all without having to think about it consciously (though they can if they need to).</p>

<p>There is <em>literally</em> a whole aspect of experience, of subconscious and intuitive processing that ADHD individuals don&#39;t have access to. And <em>stimulants don&#39;t give you access to it</em>. They just make focusing and being productive easier. Maybe you&#39;ll, over time, pick up on skills that you would&#39;ve learned if born neurotypical, or maybe you need therapy to figure it out. But, acutely, yes, it&#39;s an infrastructure problem.</p>

But tolerance exists. Like I was started on 20mg of adderall and I felt like there was small effects but like nothing major. So I upped to 30mg and it made all the difference I was able to do stuff, heck WANTED to do stuff and be up and moving. But after a few days it’s already starting to feel less effective.

<p>Stimulants fix me, BUT, they also make me depressed when it wears off and cause addiction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying that when the stimulants wear off you&#39;re tempted to escalate dosage and/or use non-therapeutic ROAs? Or are you referring more to the dependence that regular use causes?</p>

<p>Even without dependence as an issue, I&#39;m struggling to see how taking a nootropic or non-stimulant medication every day is really any different. You still have to take them regularly to achieve an effect.</p>

<p>Other options would include CBT from a licensed psychologist. I&#39;m not familiar with its effectiveness for ADHD, however.</p>

<p>Kinda sounds like you&#39;re struggling to accept that your psychiatric condition (which we have in common, fwiw) may require regular medication. I don&#39;t want to read too much into things, though, so apologies if I&#39;m off base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve taken pretty much every ADHD stimulant available. Perhaps not every formulation (that&#39;d be a bit silly), but I definitely have considerable experience in this arena.</p>

<p>Most recently, I had been taking Adderall IR 40mg TDD (total daily dose). Recently switched it back to the methylphenidate family, now on Focalin (dexmethylphenidate) 50mg TDD (Focalin XR 40mg + 10mg Focalin IR in the afternoon).</p>

<p>My experience with stimulants in general is pretty thorough, as I still struggle with fatigue on top of those.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not the same at all as taking nootropics or other non-stimulant supplements to achieve the same effect.&quot; Well, imo, you simply can&#39;t achieve the same effects / level of efficacy with nootropics and supplements. Sure, there are various stacks that you can cycle that <em>might</em> work, but that&#39;s an awful lot to keep track of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decision was made a long time ago. For me it&#39;s gotta be fuck yes. I&#39;ll do what I can with nootropics / supplements, but they&#39;ve always been somewhat (or very) underwhelming.

<p>Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#39;t. I find properly keeping up with any kind of journaling/tracking is impossible. It requires a significant time, effort, and energy investment for some of us, depending on our issues and obligations. </p>

<p>You have a medicine that you know adequately treats adhd and anxiety, but you don’t want to take that because you build tolerance and is addictive. </p>

<p>I have stopped and I would characterize the withdrawals that I had as less than caffeine. Or to put it another way, nothing to care about.</p>

<p>I would guess that this is all because of your anxiety.  See a therapist or psychiatrist about this.  Anxiety can be brutal and it is treatable on its own.  </p>

<p>If you want to avoid tolerance, simply take drug vacations - take a week off every six months. Some people don’t take it every day: 5 days amphetamines, two days off (or on something else).  </p>

<p>However if you have dealt with serious drug abuse and addiction before, you just need to decide if you are able to have a drug easily available and not abuse it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was diagnosed with ADHD and for a while I used concerta and vyvanse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also an academic and in the last few years I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time working on the computer doing research and some papers.</p>

<p>With vyvanse my motivation to do what I had to do was at 1000%. I only stopped to eat or to go to the toilet. I would literally run to the computer to start or continue work. The problem is that when I sat down at the computer and looked at the screen I couldn&#39;t think. I had a lot of difficulty reading a text and forming an idea about it. It was like the more I tried to think, the less focus I had. Therefore, despite my motivation being maximum, my productivity was terrible. And today I still suffer a lot from this condition. Sometimes I have days or moments where I feel like I&#39;m able to think fluently, but most days it takes me too long to read a single page.</p>

<p>However, i replaced the medication with supplements/nootropics with relative success.</p>

<p>This is my favorite stack for motivation:</p>

<ul>
<li>50mg-200mg of caffeine;</li>
<li>1000mg of N-Acetyl Tyrosine (not L-Tyrosine);</li>
<li>20mg of B6 (P5P);</li>
<li>800mg Avena Sativa (Dopa Mind)</li>
</ul>

<p>To help me focus and think  i have been exploring the following compounds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alpha GPC;</li>
<li>Oxiracetam;</li>
<li>Aniracetam;</li>
<li>Noopept.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>All psychiatric medicine from welbutrin to lithium ri seroquel can have dangerous effects when stoooed abruptly. They need to be used once daily tho on some accounts every other day dosing works in some cases. But the point gs they all need to be used for life to exert a lifelong effect. MAOI no different.</p>

<p>The thing is stimulants don’t just work while they are in your system. They normalize brain function long term because they enable behavioral changes feeding back facilitating brain changes.</p>

<p>Alpha receptor antagonists can be used to treat ADHD—clonidine and guanfacine. Guanfacine longer half life so is preferred but both are used in clinical practice. I used clonidine but plan to switch to guanfacine. If you are appreciably agitated as part of ur ADHD then things like lithium or add on antipsychotic can be used typical at night. Some of the newer antipsychotics are not broad spectrum dopamine receptor blockers and actually increase dopamine in conjunction with psychostimulants. Those ones gave me mad akathesia so I just stick with gold old seroquel for smoother sleep.</p>

<p>Less sugar lol. ADHD is drawn to liquid sugar because it’s as close to instantaneous energy for the prefrontal cortex that you can get. I’ll sip that fucking monster for 2-3 hours straight. It’s recommended by ADHD experts to sip sweet drinks when you need to work on stuff. Since I cut energy drinks out I make limeade or sweet tea. Three ingredients: lime juice/tea, water, sugar.</p>
