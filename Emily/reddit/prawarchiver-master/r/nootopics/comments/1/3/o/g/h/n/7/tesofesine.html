<p>Transporter Selectivity 
‚ÄúOriginally it had been reported that Tesofensine has IC50 of 8.0, 3.2 and 11.0nM at the DAT, NAT and 5HTT.[11] More recently, though, the following data was submitted: IC50 (nM) NE 1.7, SER 11, DA 65.[[12] cited in [13]] The revised IC50&#39;s would adequately explain the lack of efficacy in treating Parkinson&#39;s disease, i.e. insufficient DRI potency relative to the SERT and the NET. This could also help account for why Tesofensine is not reliably self-administered by human stimulant abusers[14] since it has been believed to be the case that DAT inhibition is necessary for this and not NET inhibition.[15][16]‚Äù</p>

<p>It apparently has a cholinergic component that seems significant enough to mention but not do a little more research on and and shows possible benifit on depression.</p>

<p>Besides being effective for weight loss I really can‚Äôt find much on it I. It‚Äôs really expensive but it‚Äôs really a pretty novel substance to come to the market.
I‚Äùm really looking for something to augment the j147 I‚Äôm taking with slightly transient but great success. </p>

<p>Anyone have any experience or thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my bad. Thanks. 
It‚Äôs hard to specifically characterize them totally and they seem to be slightly transient or occur situationally. And at the beginning of my starting it I had a really bad concussion and was going through like a month long post concussive syndrome where I was going through extreme fatigue and had frequent headaches. I can‚Äôt honestly tell if it really helped with that or it finally went away. But note that. I‚Äôve also been going through a major depression for a long time.
When I first started at either 25-50mg I‚Äôd have to take a nap. Post nap no extremely tangible effects while just laying around watching tv, then one day in the first week I was watching something and renegade by Styx came on and I noticed how googling of a song it really is. )This wouldn‚Äôt be remarkable but I haven‚Äôt been listening to music and enjoying it unless intoxicated in a long time.)
At the time I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Then while still extremely fatigued from the concussion I noticed being able to do things I‚Äôd only have to do if obligated. Then for the fist time in a couple months I went out to the bar with my best friend had a good time nothing remarkable but the next day even though extremely hungover I was soo happy talkative greatful and watching party down was more funny to me. One day while taking a pretty high dose of phenibut and 300 mg of gabapentin I went out to eat and I had a very hedonic experience eating, it‚Äôs a good restaurant and I really like the food there but this was extraordinary. That seems to be specific to that particular combination of substances.That lasted a day about a day, now the music thing is slightly transient and the other effects have balanced out but it was a game changer in terms of antidepressant. Also took like fifty milligrams Dexedrine for like a week and the recovery process was a lot easier. Not very depressing at all and lasted about four days in which I just needed a lot of sleep normally it‚Äôd take about a week
.But it takes work I get no more motivation for anything thing I‚Äôd normally not want or lik to do.
And all of this seems to maybe not be independent of neutrophic factors but it really doesn‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs the main factor in its moa. It‚Äôs unlike all of the pro bdnf nootropics I‚Äôve taken, it‚Äôs not as pep in my step as 7,8 dhf, semax or anything else I‚Äôve tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do NOT buy the capsules from Science.bio absolutely no effects. Good or bad.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt necessarily think tesofensine doesn‚Äôt work.
I think either Sfience.bio‚Äôs version was junk.
Or pill is not the best method for it.</p>

<p>If you search here on Reddit you‚Äôll see im not the only one saying this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopefully it‚Äôs legit for you. It could have been a bad batch for me, and this was 5 months ago. I also ordered Bpc and that did work. Post a follow up if the Teso is effective. I ordered the pills too. The injectable could be different</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got some tesofensine from a source during their Black Friday sale last year, but I used it for 3 weeks in April.</p>

<p>I have been tracking my food closely for over 5 years and done numerous bulks and cuts so I get predictable results when I increase or decrease my calories.  </p>

<p>Having said that, I did a minicut with 600 kcal deficit 500mcg/day tesofensine. I didn&#39;t feel a drop in energy, actually felt more energised. Did not have any appetite issues, but I already optimize my diet to maximise volume. However the focus was a bit hit and miss, sometimes it was ok, sometimes felt too scatterminded due to tesofensine being more norepinephrine biased and perhaps sporadic caffeine use also contributed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what your goals are but I wouldn&#39;t take it as nootropic, but it works as appetite suppressant if you don&#39;t have access to anything better, eg Adderall, vyvanse etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I wasn‚Äôt really looking for a nootropic but to try and see if there‚Äôs anything to the antidepressant effect. There aren‚Äôt really any tripple reuptake inhibitors and even though it looks fairly week on dopamine I was just speculating how that may alter the cognitive effect. 
But yeah thanks for the response. I guess it must have been around but I just saw it on a couple of vendors and it caught my attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, if antidepressants effects is what you&#39;re looking for, then I think you might not appreciate the elevated heart rate from being NRI, and the long half-life. 9 days half-life is messed up. If you look at the studies where they measure the serum levels, it starts to level after 7-8 weeks if I remember correctly. I think this is one of the reason why people can lose weight at a constant rate on this. The long half-life makes it take far too long to build a tolerance for it. This is my speculation.</p>

<p>Also when I stopped it, the first week was good. Then I had terrible two weeks of lethargy. Not recommended if not trying to lose weight fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah that‚Äôs unfortunate too bad from what I read it looks like they were developing other drugs with I assume more favorable transporter binding profiles. But yeah that sounds pretty rough more like a typical anti depressant for me. Not necessarily the side effects but the timeline</p>

I haven&#39;t heard of J147 before but I am wondering how it compares to Longvida. Longvida is said to cross BBB, so the results might be similar, or maybe even better!. I am now intrigued to try J147.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never ended up taking it at best it sounds like a run of the mill antidepressant which I wouldn‚Äôt doubt anyone experiencing from tesofensine. 
In some weight loss subs I read a lot of accounts of  things like aggravated mood etc however effective at weight loss.
I got hyper excited reading a couple articles on the pharmacology. It being a triple reuptake inhibitor. And the possibility of real antidepressant benefit by adding a dopaminergic component.</p>
