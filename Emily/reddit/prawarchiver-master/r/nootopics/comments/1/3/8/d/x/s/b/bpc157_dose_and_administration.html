    <div class="md"><p>-20 Celsius is recommended for long term storage. Lyophilized peptides can go for years like this but that number goes down to around 3 months IF the peptide(s) has been reconstituted. Try not to constantly freeze and unfreeze the peptides and just keep the amount you use in the coming weeks in the fridge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drugs seem to work good.  I went for more watered down dissolution and it has helped.  Tried another mots source and had some burning too. So came back to limitless.  I went from concentration (mots) of 5mg/mL to 5mg/2mL. Still get burning but it’s more tolerable.  When too concentrated that shit was fire. I’ll be trying the same with limitless BPC and hope for the same outcome. Their ghFrag and AOD never burned at any concentration just mots and bpc</p>

<p>I just ordered the bpc from everychem as well for my mother&#39;s hip. So I&#39;m curious as to the efficacy of it as it&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve seen that comes pre-mixed, especially at such a good price. I don&#39;t doubt it, just curious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I’ve never ordered from them specifically, I would like to mention the fragility of the peptide once reconstituted. The shipping process could potentially damage said peptide as I know you have to be very fragile with the vial once reconstituted and always keep it in a refrigerator or freezer to preserve shelf life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why I asked honestly. I unwittingly assume it would be send in a cold pack like other companies do with things like semax. It was just bubble wrapped in a plastic envelope. Most likely at 100 degrees or more after sitting in my mailbox for a couple of hours. I emailed them via replying to my order email, and was told my question would be forwarded.  But I didn&#39;t hear anything for over a week. Just received an email reply a couple hours ago to me reaching out again saying they&#39;d send it to the owner, again.... Still haven&#39;t heard back from a website support request I made last week though.
Not to mention that order was delayed a week because of other reasons that are on them. I shouldn&#39;t be waiting 2 weeks and counting for a simple answer. </p>

<p>Had substantial respect for everychem, and I respect sirsadalot as a researcher and the compounds he has divested a lot of time into to bring to the market, but none of this is acceptable practice, especially no customer service from a business that is selling research chemicals.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get flack for this comment, and that&#39;s fine, but something is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I had never heard nor done my research on Everychem, the experience you have had is nothing short of shady. Benefit of the doubt would say they are really having a lot of organizational problems, but that wouldn’t explain the packaging for a peptide that is now damaged if not completely inactive. Sirsadalot has contributed a lot of thorough information to the sub and I would like to see what they think of this. Let me know if you would like the vendor I, and many others, have used for bpc157.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ve bought from everychem 4 times in the last 2 months and actually just bought a couple bottles of tak-653 yesterday. The order with bpc so far the only case of having issues. Otherwise it is the fastest delivery and best pricing of any company I&#39;ve used. Honestly it&#39;s usually a 3 day delivery window with first class shipping. We will see if there&#39;s a delay this time as well though if tracking shows still in pre-shipment by end of day.</p>

<p>I do wish /sirsadalot would chime in though. I had tagged him in my initial comment assuming he would respond to a concern about his product in his subforum, but still to avail.
The only reasoning I could find for not cold packing it was from one study that said bpc is still fairly stable after reconstitution and takes a longer while to degrade.. Not quite promising enough honestly.</p>

<p>And I appreciate the offer, it&#39;s not as though I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to order it from, just that I wanted to support everychem instead given his drive to bring new things to the community as opposed to just bandwagoning things once someone else releases them. (There&#39;s a company selling his bromantane, even with his label, for 13 dollars over msrp for an extreme example). Otherwise I was going to grab the bpc from sciencebio during their pre-sale launch, and the idebenone, but decided to buy both from everychem. The idebenone is great, no issues with it. The bpc I&#39;m waiting to hear back about because it&#39;s for my mother and her hip. But don&#39;t want to give her dead BPC that has no effect given she already doesn&#39;t like needles and it would make her never want to run another cycle if it did nothing at all for her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never got a response unfortunately. Used it still as worst case scenario it would just be ineffective. My mother said the most noticed effect was it made her have to go to the bathroom within a couple hours of injection. After finishing that short cycle though (roughly 10 days) I ordered a 10mg lyophilized vial from another vendor so I could reconstitute myself. She&#39;s been taking that for a week now with no ill effects.</p>

<p>My only concern with the everychem version beyond no cold pack was the fact that it is in a vial with a screw on plastic cap (tight enough seal to keep fluid in, but technically not sealed enough to stop bacteria from ingress). So while the solution is sterile, opening and closing the vial could introduce bacteria that could get on the syringe when you go to fill. </p>

<p>Genuinely curious why sirsadalot has been silent on these things, as well as why he doesn&#39;t add a few moderators given there are people on here giving out a lot of false information.</p>
