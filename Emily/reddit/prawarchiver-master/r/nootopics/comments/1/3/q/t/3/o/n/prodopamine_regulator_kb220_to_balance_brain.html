    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this article isn’t really totally all there. The science isn’t wrong but it tends to represent itself as “this is how dopamine works” and it’s far far more complicated than that.
I would just point to f phenibut, phenibut, and gabapentin imtuced euphoria and other dopaminergic behavior.</p>

<p>This study at least is targeting steps along the way with supplements we can get our hands on to experiment with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is there is no one answer.
Trust me I’ve read everything. It really depends on what works for you. Sometimes the answers may not be dopamine related at all. 
One thing that’s worked for me post high dose amphetaminfor a long period was mirtazapine. There are studies in meth addicts recovering more quickly. Mirtazapine is a 5ht2a/2c, and adrenergic a2 antagonist. Along with a few other targets like h1 antagonist which is not preferable. But the former receptors are implicated in disinhibition of dopamine release. There is I think a 5ht1a agonist/2c antagonist with none of the adrenergic or histamine effects and it’s for female sexual dysfunction that I’d personally really like to try. 
Theoretically the therapy would be to use something low impact like these. And cognitively work on creating more productive or positive behaviors.
Byt for some people it may be glutaminergic some serotonergic, or the whole host of other things. For instance if I recall correctly inhibiting the tlr4 has a negative impact on dopamine release on meth. Which is by stopping this inflammation actually has a negative impact on dopamine release…</p>

<p>I’ve learned that my problem isn’t a dopamine deficit it’s a getting dopamine to release at the right time problem.
What I do is search a specific receptor or substance and dopamine ie “5ht2a agonist dopamine” </p>

<p>But really the answer is there is no one answer. I can say that with certainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting here </p>

<p>is an illustration of the Brain Reward Cascade, which involves the release of serotonin at the hypothalamus, where it stimulates enkephalin. The enkephalin then inhibits GABA at the substantia nigra, which, in turn, regulates the amount of dopamine released at the nucleus accumbens (or “reward site”). The dopamine originates in the VTA. Various receptors (including 5HT2a receptors, μ-opiate receptors, GABAA receptors, GABAB receptors, and dopamine receptors) are utilized in the reward cascade. Recent evidence demonstrates the role of the dorsal raphe nuclei in this cascade [85]. It is well known that, under normal conditions, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens through a number of cascading events and neurotransmitter interaction works to maintain a person’s normal drives. </p>

<p>//the paper attempts to explain what each substance is doing.  </p>

<p>I’m not so interested in his stack as I am the MOA and science behind reward cascade.</p>

<p>Here is the MOA section on ingredients :</p>

<p>The precursor 5-HTP provides the needed amino-acid to synthesize serotonin in the hypothalamus. </p>

<p>Serotonin synthesis is boosted by the trace metal chromium which acts on insulin–receptors to increase receptor sensitivity, altering the carbohydrate ratio in the periphery to favor the substance tryptophan found in the liver. </p>

<p>Tryptophan delivered to the brain is increased by 33% in this way. </p>

<p>The addition of L-phenylalanine, a precursor to dopamine, can increase the synthesis of dopamine at the Ventral–Tegmental Area (VTA) by 20%. </p>

<p>L-glutamate is converted to GABA at the substania nigra. </p>

<p>The use of D-phenylalanine (a known enkephalinase inhibitor) prevents the catabolism of methionine enkephalin and other endorphins by inhibiting the enzyme known as enkephalinase and enhances the activity of natural peptidyl opiates in the hypothalamus. </p>

<p>The substance NAC is added to KB220 to help drive the glutaminergic system at the VTA to release dopamine at the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) the reward site of the brain. </p>

<p>Rhodiola was added to the formula because it has been shown to inhibit Catecholamine–Methyl-Transferase (COMT) thereby enhancing the release of dopamine into the synapse to combine with the post dopamine D2 receptor. </p>

<p>Rhodiola is also known to inhibit mitochondrial MAO-A which serves to allow more residual dopamine to be transferred to the vesicles of presynaptic neurons (D1–D9) for higher dopamine quanta release. </p>

<p>All of these ingredients in KB220 promote a balance across the brain reward circuitry. </p>

<p>The various immune boosters like Arabinogalactans, N-acetylglucosamine [1], Astragalus, Aloe vera, Frankincense resin, White pine bark extract may have anti-cytokine qualities which could offset hormones responsible for stress induction and “anti-reward” properties.</p>
