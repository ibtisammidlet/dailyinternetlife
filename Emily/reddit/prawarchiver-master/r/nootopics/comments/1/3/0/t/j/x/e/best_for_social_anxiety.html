For more than 5 years now and I‘ve tried almost everything out there regarding therapy (3 times without success), prescribed medication, antidepressants, valium, lyrica, kratom. Life is still a total mess, painful and unbearable. Nothing helped.</p>

<p>I just found that I have Bacopa, SAM-e and Mulungu at home. Anyone experiences with one of these regarding mood, relaxation, mental changes or especially improved sociability and reduced social anxiety? </p>

<p>Any other OTC, supplement, or whatever, that you want to recommend because you think, read or experienced it‘s very helpful for social anxiety (and depression) issues?</p>

<p>I‘m very grateful for any help. For real!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bacopa made me tired. SAM-e made me feel really strange, quiet, and not social at all (irritable). Never tried Mulungu. Bromantane has been nice for socializing, but mainly anything that can induce mania type states of mind will do that. So far neboglamine has been interesting but not mind blowing. Morphodrol is an amazing one to use on occasion, it makes me really chatty. Kratom + PPAP is a fantastic combo to just enjoy what’s happening around you. Personally, if my routine is boring or messed up, I tend to be less social until I’m back in the groove. Nothing I’ve used makes me want to be social if I already don’t want to be. If I’m going to be social, said substances make socializing smoother. Getting your mental, emotional, goals, and motivations closer to a healthy state in your alone time will be the best way to increase socializing IMO. Self image is a big part of this, and no substance will make you feel better about yourself. In my experience, the more value you see in yourself, the less social anxiety will be present (confidence comes naturally when you know your value). I don’t know if you have a routine, but starting one will help to an incredible degree. Do things that make you feel excited, or things you’re good at and keep doing it. Noots and drugs will only amplify or mask your current condition, especially if you’re unwilling to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EXACTLY! 💯 you are saying everything I wanted to say as far as the ROOT cause must be addressed. Sometimes we can even confuse social anxiety with the symptoms of a behavioral disorder such as; Avoidant Personality Disorder, or psychological disorders such as ADHD, they are issues I deal with, and if treated, my &quot;social anxiety&quot; practically dissappears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely lost any routine in my life and can clearly see the curve of social anxiety increasing. Simple but didnt think of it that directly myself, just told myself, I‘m depressed now, I can‘t do anything against it. You‘re totally right with this. I have to start giving myself a ROUTINE again.</p>

<p>Whats PPAP btw?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad my response gave you some direction. I wish you luck on your journey. I&#39;m also in the process of establishing a more exciting routine and it&#39;s been great.</p>

<p>PPAP is a research chemical that&#39;s very unique in its function. It amplifies catecholamine responses without indiscriminately dumping the synapse with neurotransmitters. People commonly use it in combination with other substances to amplify their response. It&#39;s not always available and seems to be highly sought after so the stock runs out often. I use it sparingly for that reason but I&#39;ve enjoyed its effects every time I use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By itself it’s pretty mild. Some stimulation and some flutters in your chest. It’s definitely more stimulating at +30mg. There’s two scenarios it really shines:</p>

<p>1: combination with a stimulant</p>

<p>2: use near the time you’d have a response to something. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>working out (post cardio has a much more rewarding buzz)</li>
<li>music (especially new songs)</li>
<li>activities that you get a real kick out of (for me, going hiking already elicits a strong response and PPAP can make it more profound)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can build a tolerance to it so it’s best used sparingly. Higher doses can cause some anxious tones, for me higher than 50mg starts feeling too wirey but it’s also too expensive of a substance to use high doses of anyway. It works within 30ish minutes generally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve used it close to a week now at 50-60mg. It’s a very unique feeling that I get, almost like pings of adrenaline in my gut but it’s not quite the same. It’s not anxiousness, but it’s a similar rhythm and sensation in my gut as if I’m anticipating something, though it’s a more blunted feeling. It lasts maybe an hour and then goes away and I feel the same as usual. I’ve tried it with and without agmatine and it seems like agmatine helps promote that particular feeling. I haven’t tested it enough yet, but it seems like if I eat first it works better than an empty stomach. I’m not 100% sure of that yet. I tried 20mg IN today and it wasn’t the best going down lol. It’s floury and cakes up so it lingered in my airway. That definitely caused stronger subjective effects but it felt like anxiety with that ROA. I do software engineering for work and this week I haven’t noticed any cognitive differences. I’m not depressed, which some people on here say it helps with, so I haven’t felt any better than usual either. I’m going to continue using it but I may throw bromantane into the mix. Overall it’s been a good experience, but I want to give it more time to see if it works differently over a longer period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The abdominal sensation is more neutral of an effect. I think some people prone to anxiety could interpret it as uncomfortable. The IN route made the sensation very strong and in that scenario, it was a tad uncomfortable. Yesterday I took another 40mg later in the day and I think I finally noticed a cognitive change. I was much more introspective and had some positive realizations I need to consider in my personal life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does work great but be extremely careful. Relief can be addictive and the tolerance/withdrawal is no joke. Absolutely horrific. On par with benzos but dependence builds even faster imo. This is definitely a drug, not just a nootropic, for me I personally got more intoxicated and anti-anxiety from phenibut than either lorazepam or Xanax. My anxiety in general has gotten bad over the years but my sleep anxiety was absolutely horrendous, leading to crippling insomnia, nothing worked until phenibut, and not only did it work it obliterated insomnia, I finally felt free. I only took it for around two weeks, but when I tried to cut I experienced withdrawals I couldn&#39;t even imagine. I didn&#39;t sleep for 5 days, shaking, delusions, unbelievable anxiety, and intense depersonalization. I told myself I wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to let this happen, but I did. When you&#39;re truly desperate decision making and rational tends to be something that people lack, and that&#39;s why I recommend extreme caution to anybody considering phenibut as a potential option for their mental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it’s definitely a slippery slope that has effects that can vary. I’ve personally not had withdrawals or dependence but that doesn’t  mean I recommend it. I’ve never taken Xanax but I’ve had an rx for klonopin in the past and in my experience the prescription benzos are far stronger and carry greater withdrawals- but again I don’t discount your experience. I think for phenibut  most people struggle with efficacious dosing that work but minimize the side effect profile. Given the long half life and unique properties it can feel like it’s not doing anything then BAM hit you in a few hours. 250-750mg 1x a week or 2x in a 10 day period never had issues. Anything over 1g  really starts to push the envelope for responsible usage. As always ymmv</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me benzos were never that intoxicating, they just made me calm and completely shut off anxiety, although I think it had some delusion of sobriety, meaning I was probably more intoxicated than I thought. Phenibut not only shut off anxiety directly, but had a euphoria similar to alcohol, which imo benzos don&#39;t have at all. I admit I took doses well above the recommended range, until I felt heavily sedated as that was the only way I could force myself to sleep. For me phenibut at high doses, say past 2.5g, had a strong alcohol like body high, although with a much clearer headspace. With benzos I just felt more tired and calm the higher the dose it took. Everyone reacts to drugs differently, and I probably react more to phenibut and less to benzos than the average person. Although I must admit I have never developed a massive tolerance to benzos, and from what I&#39;ve heard the withdrawals can last months so I don&#39;t doubt the withdrawals can be even worse. But for me personally I have never experienced withdrawals like that, and non that happened from such a short duration of use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also all that being said I do genuinely think phenibut can be a great tool if used properly, I just think it doesn&#39;t have a lot of wiggle room with carelessness. Not only did it have acute withdrawals, it left me with more anxiety than ever before for months following my use, and it also reignited my depersonalization/derealization. Overall it can be useful but tread lightly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and Phenibut psychose is not joke either. Because it is not outright poison like booze is, there is no basically limit how much you can up you dosage until...</p>

<p>Problem with it - just like with booze is that bit unique way of being stimulant / sedative simultaneosly, and seemingly you get more tolerant to sedative/anxiolytic part whereas stimulance will prevail, and that only with anxiolytic part gradually turning upside down with rapidly increasing tolerance can just lead anything what is mentioned in section of Phenibut overdoses in common wikipedia article. Thing is that when you overdose booze you will pass out and that prevents it doing it above certain level, but Phenibut does not have this thing of limiting you to overdose it constantly and increasingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all, yeah sure, thanks, I have been heavily addicted to it. I also started extremely careful and just taking it once a week max. But if you suffer that much and suddenly find a way to stop this suffering so easily, you just slip into taking it once more, so 2x a week and then more and more. I finally enjoyed life, I was functional, I was part of the world, of the society, everything was beautiful and I could finally live. It was an amazing time but I abused it daily in huge doses as it helped me so much and completely changed my life to a beautiful one I could have never imagined, a movie like life for real.  Tolerance increased like crazy. I was at doses like of in total 10g per day.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was incredibly painful and hell on earth. Just unbelievable mental as well as physical pain I could never describe and wouldn&#39;t even wish my worst enemy.</p>

<p>More than one year of not touching it. I managed to get off of it. It was beautiful, but I just can&#39;t afford it anymore. I can&#39;t control it. It&#39;s too good to be true and withdrawal is the heaviest thing ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be a little unconventional but maybe adrafinil could help. Adrafinil is literally modafinil after it passes through your liver. Modafinil is a wakefulness stimulant, which essentially means it destroys mental fatigue, enhances focus, and overall makes cognition stay at its peak. It does all this very effectively, much more so than say caffeine, without causing jitters, adrenaline, or anxiety, it&#39;s like it almost works in the background. This would not directly obliterate your anxiety but I have found it allows one to think clearer under the duress anxiety, and also eliminates the fatigue that uncomfortable social situations can bring. It can also make socializing more rewarding and immersive. I feel this combined with another more conventional source of anti-anxiety treatment/meds could be promising. This is not without its risks and is probably a longshot but it helped with me, I would strongly recommend doing your own research especially when combining with other drugs, medications, and nootropics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exposure is the most effective treatment for anxiety. Nothing else comes close. If someone with a fear of heights started jumping out of a plane every day eventually they would become less afraid of heights. It is virtually guaranteed. Now jumping out of a plane a single time might not help and may even make things worse. In order for exposure to be effective it needs to be repeated over and over again. And yes therapy has been proven to be effective for social anxiety and the reason that it is effective is because every single evidence based therapy for social anxiety primarily utilizes exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a class in college where we had to give a speech on a new topic every week for 6 months. At the end of those 6 months do you know what I was not less afraid of?  Giving speeches.</p>

<p>I have seen the shockingly few studies on exposure and a couple things are clear.  Most say that CBT and medication had better result albeit with exposure therapy approaching statistical significance for positive improvement on social phobia. However they also gauged this by questions given to the participants after the end of that exposure.  </p>

<p>You know how relieved you feel once you are out of a social situation with phobia.  A lot!  Immediately after I think that wasn&#39;t as bad as I thought.  That&#39;s the thing about social phobia.  It&#39;s never as bad as you thought but the issue is you think it will be.</p>

<p>If they wanted to do a legitimate study they would question the subjects immediately prior to these exposures and follow up with how they are doing post study which most didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So exposure therapy only helps while you are in the moment. After the fact you are reset to afraid of the next event.  </p>

<p>Also nobody I have known has ever gotten less afraid of heights with exposure and we faced a lot of that sh*t in the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is not a single intervention for any mental health problem in the entire field of psychology that is more supported by evidence than exposure. Pretty much the only thing we can know with certainty when it comes to psychology is that exposure works. And yes, CBT is the most evidence based approach for treating social anxiety, and the behavioural part of CBT is exposure. CBT for social anxiety is exposure therapy (with a cognitive therapy component as well, but exposure is the most important part).</p>

<p>If you had given a speech in your class every single day for six months you would probably be less afraid of giving speeches, if you had given one every week for six years you would also probably be less afraid. The fact that you say it was never as bad as you thought is exposure therapy in action. Every time you expose yourself to something frightening and realize it is not as bad as you thought in chips away at your unhelpful/irrational beliefs. With repeated exposures eventually it sinks in and you actually start seeing the frightening stimulus as less frightening. This is virtually a law of human psychology.</p>

<p>In order for exposure therapy to be effective you have to do it correctly though. If you end an exposure before you have calmed down it will not work. Also if you use secondary avoidance strategies (such as using a drug to reduce anxiety) it will not work. And if you do not do the exposure frequently enough and with enough volume it will not work. Anecdotal accounts of people saying they faced their fears and yet remain afraid does not in anyway mean that exposure therapy does not work. Among those who practice evidence based psychology it is not even a matter of debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes usually it is prudent to use incremental exposure. To tell a person with a fear of heights to jump out of a plane is called “flooding” which is the most extreme version of exposure. Flooding can be very effective and can allow a person to bypass the entire exposure hierarchy however it comes with risks and is rarely used by clinicians. First of all it is simply extremely unpleasant for the client. But the main risk is that you would send the clients anxiety skyrocketing and they would then likely not carry through with repeated exposures which would just traumatize them and make the problem worse. It is very important for a client to calm down before ending exposures as they need to learn than it is not as bad as they thought (or at least that they can handle it) and not the other way around lol.</p>

<p>The reason I used the plane example is that you had brought it up first. I don’t think many (if any) therapists would recommend such an extreme exposure but if the client was to do it enough times it would most likely actually work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big problem with exposure is  that it just doesn&#39;t change me being mentally or biochemically restricted or even retarded, kind of dumb and numb at the same time, it doesn&#39;t improve my ability to have and hold normal conversations, be able to start a topic, know something to talk about, be charming, cool, funny, talkative, intelligent, have joy in socializing or have any interests, passions or fascinations. My depression kills all this as addition as I really think my brain, my neuro/biochemistry, my central nervous sytem or whatever, is just physiologically restricted. I tried a lot before using any substance to help but even my psychiatrist now says, that due to my previous cases of strong treatment resistance she also is pretty sure that my depression and anxiety is of biochemical cause. So as someone with ADHD has not enough dopamine flowing or someone with Parkinson has too little, I also have physiological/neurological/biochemical issues. My brain needs treatment additionally to my mental state of mind. I guess... I also can&#39;t know for sure as pdocs are still not able to scan your brain for precise physiological causes of the mental health issues of pychiatric patients and mentally ill people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent years (starting as a teenager) thinking that there was something wrong with my brain and that I had a “mental illness” that was causing my depression and anxiety. In hindsight I realize I was essentially brainwashed by a cult. I see psychiatry as a cult who preys upon people who are struggling (and there are so many reasons why a person may be struggling) convinces them that the reason they are struggling is that they have a “chemical imbalance” in their brain (despite their being absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support this claim). Then gives them powerful mind altering drugs with very limited evidence of efficacy in the long term, and then those drugs disrupt their normal brain functioning and cause an <em>actual</em> chemical imbalance in their brain. They then continue to get worse (or at least not get better) due to the incredibly harmful drugs they are taking and their symptoms are blamed on their “mental illness”. </p>

<p>I believed in this narrative for many years. I tried med after med after med just looking for the drug that “worked for me”. Nothing worked, most gave me nothing but side effects and some gave me mild short term relief and just made things worse in the long run. It wasn’t until I realized drugs were not the answer and that I had everything I needed inside myself to heal that I was finally able to overcome both the depression and anxiety. </p>

<p>How is someone supposed to get better when they believe they are fundamentally broken at a biologically level? This belief is almost as destructive as the drugs themselves. I would do anything to get back the years I spent popping pills and feeling that I was a hopeless person with a disease of a brain. I believed this narrative 100%, and yet in hindsight I realize it was 100% wrong.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend looking into acceptance and commitment therapy if you are not familiar with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you know you&#39;ve had an issue controlling your usage of phenibut in the past and it progressed to the point of addiction / dependence, why would you think it would <em>ever</em> be a good idea to go near it again?</p>

<p>You may not want to hear this, but frankly you should never go near phenibut again. I&#39;d try to avoid habit-forming depressants again unless they&#39;re prescribed by a doctor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know because life was only really beautiful during the time when I was using Phenibut. That were golden times… And I just feel so drained, sad, anxious and tired of all this suffering day after day and without any good reason. I‘m happy to be more than a year clean off it and I know I can never touch it again due to my addiction issue and the most horrible withdrawal I went through but sometimes like when I wrote that comment I think about it maybe becoming reality to just have a few weeks of the perfect world again. But I know from experience I can‘t use it anymore, as I abused it hardly and it will end in a much harder time as soon as I built tolerance and am back in withdrawals again. I feel bad but not that phenibut-withdrawal or phenibut-rebound bad and even if I feel like shit I feel happy to not be in that state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, I really do. As someone who has personally struggled with an anxiety disorder, and well as opioid addiction and dependence (recovered/full remission), I can appreciate the allure of a substance that previously brought you great relief and a feeling of normalcy.</p>

<p>There are other options out there and something will work, but it won&#39;t happen overnight. A drug or nootropic may not even be the answer. Keep an open mind, it may take hard work and some self-reflection to eventually find relief.</p>

<p>For starters, I&#39;d highly recommend looking into a good psychiatrist, as well as a therapist/psychologist, if those are options (if you only choose one, go with the psychiatrist, as they&#39;re able to prescribe medication if appropriate).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making the decision to see a psychiatrist was the first step. My pdoc aided me in properly diagnosing my panic disorder and prescribed appropriate medication (which I still take to this day). I had never really been taught the difference between psychologists and psychiatrists, so it took me a while to figure out what I needed.</p>

<p>It was also psychiatrists who treated me (several doctors over many years due to relapses mostly) for opioid addiction and dependence with Suboxone, which eventually stuck. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ve loosened it up, but only certain psychiatrists are/were permitted to prescribe Suboxone (it&#39;s specifically for opioid addiction).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the reason I was successful was because I genuinely wanted to get--and stay--opioid free. I made a conscious choice that I didn&#39;t want to use opioids if possible ever again, and especially not for recreational value.</p>

<p>I have more to say, but I wanted to give you something. The key to being free from addiction of anything is a true desire and willingness to stop using that substance, and hopefully, to not abuse any substances in the future.</p>

<p>Doctors and nootropics may be able to aid with the physical symptoms and dependence (and I&#39;d recommend utilizing these tools if needed). <strong>However,</strong> at the end of the day, if you still want to get that high (even a little bit), nothing is going to stick.</p>

<p>Edit: also, if there are individuals in your life who encourage you to continue abusing substances, or whose presence either encourages use or is typically associated with using (i.e., people who you get high with), you&#39;ll need to remove yourself from their social circles and cut off contact (unless they also get clean). I&#39;ve never found this particularly difficult if you&#39;ve truly decided to change your lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so true, what you said:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>100%. You will always think back how easy you can get these good feelings and/or relief by just popping something. You have to really learn that and how it&#39;s not the solution, a bad decision and making everything worse after time.</p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s about reducing depression and social anxiety symptoms, while also curing my cognitive deficits (ADD like) so I really always hop back to using anything cause I don&#39;t know how to get better with these, I suffered through these symptoms until I was 17 completely sober. Then came the time when I said, I tried so much and it probably won&#39;t improve ever, fuck it, I suffer so much and there&#39;s no perspective improving, I will make my life as functional and enjoyable as possible and just take what I need. Now I&#39;m using for 5 years already - first alcohol, got off of it, then phenibut, got off of it, then kratom and now kratom and lyrica.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your struggle sounds quite similar to mine, tbh. You deserve a lot of credit for making it to 17 sober with what you were likely dealing with (I didn&#39;t). PD (panic disorder) was only part of the equation for me.</p>

<p>The symptoms began manifesting around the same time I developed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), at which point I was only 15. Opioids were the easiest thing to acquire (and hide), so I started self-medicating. I also started using cannabis regularly to help deal with IBS symptoms.</p>

<p>For a while, the weed was enough. Taking easier courses and doing what I could to lower my stress definitely helped, though it didn&#39;t come without cost (dropped all honors and more challenging courses).</p>

<p>Are you getting Lyrica from a doctor? It sounds like you just want something to help so you don&#39;t feel so badly all the time (rather than a particular interest in getting high off of &#39;x&#39;). I&#39;d strongly recommend finding a psychiatrist and getting properly diagnosed if you have not already. This sounds more like a psychiatric issue than pure substance abuse.</p>

<p>I would also (after addressing the meds/drugs) look into a psychologist/therapist that specializes in CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) if you have insurance that covers it. I&#39;ve recently started doing this to some extent and I find it very helpful for anxiety and depression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in treatment since I was 16 or so. I&#39;ve been through all the typical antidepressants, SSRIs, SNRIs, tetracyclic, tricyclic, atypical, diazepam, wellbutrin, moclobemide, mirtazapine and so on. I&#39;ve also been through 3 therapies already (2 depth psychological, 1 CBT). Everything without success. That&#39;s making it even harder if not even the traditional medicine or psychiatric way can help me... Sure there still are other medications to try (now I was prescribed the Lyrica to try) and maybe also other talk / behavioral therapies but it&#39;s just seems like I&#39;m highly treatment-resistant. And surely 100% it&#39;s a psychiatric, neurological and psychological issue. I&#39;m sure about that, it&#39;s not about getting high, it never was. My self medication purely started with healing myself from the pain, reducing the suffering, feeling normal and functional. I never wanted to get high out of. I always self medicated my symptoms with these substances I tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say if you’ve been prescribed benzos, and lyrica and not even kratom on top of that is working, then you may need an antidepressant. Not sure if you’ve tried them before but you didn’t mention that you did. I’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety as well as depression but I can usually force myself out of bed and get the basics accomplished which includes taking summer classes, with some help from kratom and gabapentin(which is almost the same as lyrica). I understand if you don’t wanna go that route as I don’t want to either but I’ve promised myself I would if nothing else works. You may need like a light dose of Wellbutrin or Prozac. And it wouldn’t have to be forever…just as long as you need til you feel you’ve recovered some balance and stability in your life. Then you can try coming off it and a lot of ppl do fine like that or they decide to just continue taking it cuz it’s really helping them. I’m not a doctor so don’t take what I’m saying as the only option! </p>

<p>You might also wanna try phenibut if you haven’t because that always obliterates any social anxiety I have. It’s just not good to take more than twice a week because you can become physically addicted to it. Really hoping you feel the inner security and depression relief you’re looking for!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does work great but be extremely careful. Relief can be addictive and the tolerance/withdrawal is no joke. Absolutely horrific. On par with benzos but dependence builds even faster imo. This is definitely a drug, not just a nootropic, for me I personally got more intoxicated and anti-anxiety from phenibut than either lorazepam or Xanax. My anxiety in general has gotten bad over the years but my sleep anxiety was absolutely horrendous, leading to crippling insomnia, nothing worked until phenibut, and not only did it work it obliterated insomnia, I finally felt free. I only took it for around two weeks, but when I tried to cut I experienced withdrawals I couldn&#39;t even imagine. I didn&#39;t sleep for 5 days, shaking, delusions, unbelievable anxiety, and intense depersonalization. I told myself I wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to let this happen, but I did. When you&#39;re truly desperate decision making and rational tends to be something that people lack, and that&#39;s why I recommend extreme caution to anybody considering phenibut as a potential option for their mental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all, yeah sure, thanks, I have been heavily addicted to it. I also started extremely careful and just taking it once a week max. But if you suffer that much and suddenly find a way to stop this suffering so easily, you just slip into taking it once more, so 2x a week and then more and more. I finally enjoyed life, I was functional, I was part of the world, of the society, everything was beautiful and I could finally live. It was an amazing time but I abused it daily in huge doses as it helped me so much and completely changed my life to a beautiful one I could have never imagined, a movie like life for real.  Tolerance increased like crazy. I was at doses like of in total 10g per day.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was incredibly painful and hell on earth. Just unbelievable mental as well as physical pain I could never describe and wouldn&#39;t even wish my worst enemy.</p>

<p>More than one year of not touching it. I managed to get off of it. It was beautiful, but I just can&#39;t afford it anymore. I can&#39;t control it. It&#39;s too good to be true and withdrawal is the heaviest thing ever.</p>
