        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used it for awhile at 1.25mg sublingual with good results.  Maybe a little too manic though, I worked myself months beyond the point of exhaustion and into a very bad state of mind.  I want to try it again but be a lot more careful.</p>

<p>Like all psych drugs, I think I&#39;ve read it depletes some specific nutrients (would like to find this citation again),  I also wonder if its hard on circadian health although the half life is only a few hours.  I just remember several days of insomnia when I first began taking it.  I have deep skepticism with all stimulants, I love em more than anything but I just can&#39;t imagine theyre sustainable or healthy.</p>

<p>sirsadalot had some interesting insights here but I&#39;m not really clear on all the implications.  Less ominous than I remembered it being.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/t4r9h1/the_complete_guide_to_dopamine_and/</a></p>

<p>If it carries <em>some</em> risk, is it safe to cycle?  </p>

<p>Maybe even try a lower dose?  This user quoted a selegiline researcher, recommending a maximum dose of 500mcg.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/h9gldn/are_amphetamines_metabolites_of_selegiline/fv0afll/">https://old.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/h9gldn/are_amphetamines_metabolites_of_selegiline/fv0afll/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is saying it causes psychosis and inevitable dopamine downregulation (on NooTopics) but can never show any literature for this. I&#39;d like to see it to have a better understanding and am having a hard time researching other people&#39;s claims over the matter. </p>

<p>I mean, yes, dopamine downregulation makes sense for any MAOI, but will it be notable? Speaking to long-term users of Selegiline, it seems the net dopaminergic activity is still higher overall. This is only based on their anecdotal sustained level of motivation and antidepressant effect. I mean, the only reason someone would take Selegiline long-term is if the overall net benefits were higher than previous to taking it.</p>

<p>And say if there was some sort of notable effect of dopamine downregulation, wouldn&#39;t it just upregulate back to normal after titration and cessation of usage? </p>

<p>Now for psychosis. I believe the claims for it were that MAOI&#39;s, in general, increase dopamine all over in the brain. Some of those regions can make you more prone to psychosis. I still would like to see literature on this because I&#39;m interested in this topic. </p>

<p>I personally have never come across anyone noting they experienced psychosis or anything similar to it on Selegiline. This doesn&#39;t mean that Selegiline couldn&#39;t do this, but I figured it&#39;s somewhat noteworthy to mention considering I speak to people who use all sorts of MAOI&#39;s regularly, including Selegiline. </p>

<p>What is relatively common is that some people can get a little manic for the first couple weeks while using an MAOI until the start to stabilize. This usually doesn&#39;t happen if the dosage is titrated correctly. Some people who have BPD can be more prone to mania with MAOI&#39;s, though.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the whole &quot;amphetamine metabolite&quot; thing with Selegiline, I recall metabolites are the enantiomer of amphetamines that have no amphetamine-like effect. Here is some literature showing the metabolites. --- (<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Methamphetamine-and-amphetamine-derived-from-the-of-Romberg-Needleman/7cc2b9ad208bcd9c3316ac2e83875613e038f74d">https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Methamphetamine-and-amphetamine-derived-from-the-of-Romberg-Needleman/7cc2b9ad208bcd9c3316ac2e83875613e038f74d</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the exact same thoughts as you over the topic. Literally, every single one. I&#39;d like to see more literature on the enantiomer of the given metabolites. I know the metabolites don&#39;t act like amphetamines, but some are a part of Selegiline&#39;s effects once you reach a higher dosage of Selegiline. The &quot;wakefulness promotion&quot; of Selegiline is apparently caused by one of the metabolites. Not that this has to do with any of the topics, I just thought that was interesting.</p>

<p>The dopamine downregulation and tolerance thing you spoke about really stuck with me. It&#39;s like you copied the thoughts from my brain. I&#39;m not sure what to think of the criticism of MAOI&#39;s tolerance. I know it obviously exists, but the net effect you spoke about makes sense. I&#39;m all ears if anyone more knowledgeable wants to speak over these subjects though.</p>

<p>As per sirsadalot&#39;s previous posts, I&#39;ve been trying to heal my brain after selegiline with bromantane and low dose naltrexone.  Bromantane is effective enough that I have quit snus tobacco cold turkey after years of heavy use.</p>

<p>Curious, how did you get your hands on istradeffyline?  Cant find an off label use or generic as its pretty new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My doctor was familiar with Naltrexone, so after sending them some links I was prescribed 50mg pills off label.  The tablets readily dissolve in water, so I just put a measured amount of water in a tincture bottle.  I keep in in the fridge for peace of mind.  Its about 100mcg a drop.  Can even add a tiny bit of citric acid as a preservative but its not necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll make some obvious observations.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People take meth long-term. Does that imply it must be good for you, lol? We do stupid stuff - doesn’t mean it’s good for us!</p></li>
<li><p>If you had problems with the previous dose potentially causing mania, don’t you think that you should change the dose???  Your goal should always be to take the lowest dose needed.  If you want the highest dose that you can get away with, that rarely works well.</p>

<p>A. Taking it sublingually makes it much stronger.  Don’t do that. Swallow it. The pills are really inexpensive. </p>

<p>B. Or try it eod sublingually. </p>

<p>C. I’m not going to suggest pre-cursors would move the needle much, but who knows.</p>

<p>D. Try different things like Semax, which is safe. Or rotate things like ppiracitam.  Things that operate differently.</p></li>
<li><p>Try safer ways to increase dopamine. Ice baths; bromantane.  Perhaps</p></li>

<p>As per sirsadalot&#39;s previous posts, I&#39;ve been trying to heal my brain after selegiline with bromantane and low dose naltrexone.  Bromantane is effective enough that I have quit snus tobacco cold turkey after years of heavy use.</p>

<p>Curious, how did you get your hands on istradeffyline?  Cant find an off label use or generic as its pretty new.</p>
