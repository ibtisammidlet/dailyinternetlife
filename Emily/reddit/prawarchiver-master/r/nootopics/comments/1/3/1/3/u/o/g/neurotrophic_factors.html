        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My question relates to neurons and receptor up-regulation. Do any of the neurotrophic factors help in the process of up-regulation of receptors in the pineal gland. Pharmacologically speaking, too much of an agonist or hormone will down-regulate receptors, limiting function. The inverse is a process over time as they are gradually recycled to the surface of the cell again. I’m editing this because i want to know if any neurotrophic factors can regulate melatonin receptors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sirsadalot posted a comprehensive guide in which, according to him, this is one and only way for upregulation currently and everything else is shit. I have researched this concept a bit, and I am posting this in hopes someone will disprove it. Basically, I am looking for reasons why possibly this stack would fail, what is its weak point, so that it can get my brain going to improve it.  </p>

<p>Start with Bromantane sublingual at a dosage of 100mg per day, taken in the morning.</p>

<p>Add 3g of L-Tyrosine to the stack, also taken in the morning.</p>

<p>Take 1-2 cups of coffee with the Bromantane and L-Tyrosine.</p>

<p>Take Sulbutiamine during the day at a dosage of 400-600mg.</p>

<p>Take Uridine monophosphate at night at a dosage of 700mg.</p>

<p>Add Agmatine Sulfate at a dosage of 1g to sensitize to dopamine and protect from Bromantane amyloid buildup.</p>

<p>Add Ginko Biloba 50-1 extract at a dosage of 120mg to take away from the GABAergic effects of Bromantane and Agmatine, and to add to dopamine and memory ability.</p>

<p>Use the full stack for a month before assessing its effectiveness.  </p>

<p>Bromantane (100mg sublingual in the morning):<br/>
Bromantane is an atypical psychostimulant and anxiolytic that enhances dopamine synthesis and increases expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, leading to increased dopamine levels (Lapin, 1999). This can improve motivation, focus, and mood.<br/>
Source: Lapin, I. (1999). Bromantane, a new original psychostimulant and anxiolytic drug. Eksp Klin Farmakol, 62(5), 32-34.<br/>
L-Tyrosine (3g in the morning):<br/>
L-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, and can help replenish neurotransmitter levels. Combining L-Tyrosine with Bromantane may enhance dopamine synthesis and boost cognitive function (Fernstrom &amp; Fernstrom, 2007).<br/>
Source: Fernstrom, J. D., &amp; Fernstrom, M. H. (2007). Tyrosine, phenylalanine, and catecholamine synthesis and function in the brain. Journal of Nutrition, 137(6), 1539S-1547S.<br/>
Caffeine (1-2 cups of coffee):<br/>
Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that can enhance alertness and cognitive function by blocking adenosine receptors and increasing neurotransmitter release, including dopamine (Nehlig, 2010).<br/>
Source: Nehlig, A. (2010). Is caffeine a cognitive enhancer? Journal of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease, 20(S1), 85-94.<br/>
Sulbutiamine (400-600mg during the day):<br/>
Sulbutiamine is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1) that increases thiamine levels in the brain. It can enhance memory, attention, and mood by modulating cholinergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems (Tiev et al., 1999).<br/>
Source: Tiev, K. P., Cabanis, P., &amp; Imbert, J. C. (1999). Treatment of chronic postinfectious fatigue: randomized double-blind study of two doses of sulbutiamine (400-600 mg/day) versus placebo. Revue de Médecine Interne, 20(10), 912-918.<br/>
Uridine monophosphate (700mg at night):<br/>
Uridine is a nucleotide that can enhance memory and cognition by increasing synaptic plasticity and promoting the synthesis of brain phosphatidylcholine (Wurtman et al., 2000).<br/>
Source: Wurtman, R. J., Cansev, M., &amp; Sakamoto, T. (2000). Use of phosphatide precursors to promote synaptogenesis. Annual Review of Nutrition, 20(1), 59-73.  </p>

<p>Agmatine sulfate (1g):</p>

<p>Agmatine has neuroprotective properties and can enhance dopamine receptor sensitivity, further potentiating the dopaminergic effects of other components in the stack (Gilad &amp; Gilad, 2016).</p>

Ginkgo Biloba 50-1 extract (120mg):<br/>
Ginkgo Biloba is a well-known herbal supplement that can improve cognitive function and memory by increasing cerebral blood flow and exerting antioxidant effects. Additionally, it has been shown to have positive effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission, which may synergize with other components in the stack (Ahlemeyer &amp; Krieglstein, 2003; Rigney et al., 1999).<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no proof that L-Tyrosine upregulates dopamine, it only increases it, so it only seems to make sense in people where there is a gene defect causing dopamine deficiency. Also same with Uridine, it does not upregulate, same with caffeine.  </p>

<p>Also 100mg bromantane is too much, and SubL is not the best ROA, Intranasal is, at approx 27mg best dose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, L-tyrosine or uridine does not upregulate dopamine. sirsadalot simply claimed it helps in combination specifically with bromantane - only with bromantane, and only in this stack, and with these exact dosages. On their own, they don&#39;t upregulate dopamine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ man, did you read the post? Either? This one or Sirsad&#39;s? This is about <em>dopamine</em> upregulation. The &quot;one and only way to upregulate&quot; my ass. Most antagonists can upregulate (&quot;but that doesn&#39;t count!!11!!1!!&quot; I already hear you saying). Not just that, some receptors upregulate <strong>in response</strong> (!!!) to agonism, such as certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. You&#39;re just flat out wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that between my post and your reply, I found sirsadalot said Uridine monophosphate is dangerous, and l-tyrozine ans sulbutiamine unnecessary.</p>

<p>He now recommends D-Serine + Ceylon Cinnamon + PQQ to enhance NMDA activity</p>

<p>found info nalt is also obsolete</p>

<p>it seems the only constant in the stacks is bromantine (intranasal at x1 dose or sublingual x2 dose with oil) and alcar is always recommended (starting high oe around 1000mg, then 500mg)</p>

<p>It feels like bromantine + alcar + nac are something that has had good rep over the years, while the other stuff is not so much clear</p>
