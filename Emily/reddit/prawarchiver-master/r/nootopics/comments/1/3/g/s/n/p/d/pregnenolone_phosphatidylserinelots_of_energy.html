        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>obviously not unlimited energy, but I have been aware that is combo for me works really well in allowing me to tolerate 100mg of pregnenolone and feel really good. </p>

<p>Phosphatidylserine works by reducing any cortisol rise from the pregnenolone which is the big issue for me. last night I decided to bike for 2 hours because I felt like it starting at 12:28 am. </p>

<p>I was dropping off some mail I wanted to send last night because the mail lady I don&#39;t think likes me, so I usually now find those blue collection boxes and bike there, like a 9 minutesl round trip. </p>

<p>after doing that I decided to bike across the bridge in my area as it&#39;s been a while, ok like an extra 10 minutes, then I wanted to go a little bit further.. but then I&#39;d figured I could to all the way to the very top of the beach side part of my area, and I did, and even slightly further. in total the actual trip takes 2 hours there and it was really enjoyable for me. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I would have ever done this without pregnenlone. like yeah I am 19, but I&#39;m not an athlete, and that&#39;s really impressive for me. 
for comparison, DHEA somehow rises testosterone or maybe DHT wayy to high and makes me feel stressed and angry, which I think DHEA and cortisol are correlated. has anyone else tried this? </p>

<p>also, I take finasteride twice a week, it prevents hair loss for me I think and more importantly acne which pregnenolone I know will cause (DHT doesn&#39;t like my skin or rather the other way around).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DHEA negatively modulates GABA activity and inhibits serotonergic activity in downstream cascades.   </p>

<p>Testosterone, and downstream metabolites, DHT and estradiol increase GABA activity.</p>

<p>DHEA also decreases cortisol, and I get the best results when I take DHAE and prognenolone in the morning, thus both of these hormones peak early in the l circadian cycle.</p>

<p>Very science-based approach I see.</p>

<p>No oral DHT blockers are worth it for young men. Your masculinity (especially during development) matters a lot more than some acne.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you completely missed the point about how pregnenolone will raise DHT. </p>

<p>because I already have things that raise testosterone individually, and I know what a lot of testosterone feels like. and I know that taking finasteride at high doses without pregnenolone like I did before was something I didn&#39;t like. </p>

<p>this is really the only way I can correct my hormones so I can be a better person. you also still didn&#39;t address the safety profile from finasteride bc you&#39;d don&#39;t ain&#39;t got shit on it. </p>

<p>if you want to talk about the neurosteroid risk if there is any because all that&#39;s from is from like a way higher multiple dose on rats, and I take etifoxine generally anyway. </p>

<p>I would understand if I was like 16 and I was taking it but after puberty, It really does not matter. if you care so much about young men and finasteride I would watch hair Cafe&#39;s video on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6zdK_YdE1nM">actually here you go</a></p>

<p>like come on do you think I didn&#39;t read a bunch about this and try it myself before figured out this regimen. no point in talking to people like you. do you even know how much 100mg of pregnenolone is and how obvious in my situation that a log of it is turning into DHEA which feeds testosterone than DHT? </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get it when I&#39;ve taken finasteride and my acne goes away but it lowers DHT too much, but then when I take it with pregnenolone it&#39;s the perfect balance of having healthy DHT and test while still having happy skin. also my skin genetics are horrible and I abhore my parents for not even doing anything about it when I was in middle school, I really don&#39;t care what you think. do you think men who go bald or actually confident or are they just coping?? it&#39;s literally a lie that you&#39;re attractive bald, and the same applies to skin. </p>

<p>also, puberty ends at 16??? like what lol. &quot;my development&quot; I wish I could make your face look like shit and make you start losing hair so I could see the choice you&#39;d make in my situation. but keep on regurgitating the bs because you&#39;re locked in for life and people like you don&#39;t deserve to even be spoken to. because ur stuuupidddd and don&#39;t bother to read what I say for the past responses and that&#39;s why I typed all of this up. </p>

<p>have fun NOT responding to anything I say. oh wait, maybe this response was because of my heightened test and DHT from pregnenolone, any more DHT without finasteride and I&#39;d probably be moving mountains to ensure your opinion could never ever ever be heard again. LOL, can&#39;t wait till you realize how it feels to be bald, or just not being able to manipulate your hormones and turning into a lethargic aging being that will continue for the rest of your life</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddy DHEA can also cause oily skin, and some other secondary male sexual characteristics, as it can also activate androgen receptors.  </p>

<p>If fact, boys who get acne and body hair growth at age of 9-10 do so through increased adrenal activity and DHEA production, while their testicular testosterone production has not kicked-in yet.</p>

<p>It is also possible that what you are experiencing with pregnenolone + PS can be easily explained by DHEA as well.</p>

<p>You take pregnenolone before sleep, which converts to DHEA, which lowers GABA activity, which messes with your sleep and make you feel energised, and you take PS which increases GABA.</p>

<p>Hypothesizing at this point is moot without testing anything. If you are too worried you get saliva tests for hormones including cortisol and see the numbers and then act according to data.</p>
