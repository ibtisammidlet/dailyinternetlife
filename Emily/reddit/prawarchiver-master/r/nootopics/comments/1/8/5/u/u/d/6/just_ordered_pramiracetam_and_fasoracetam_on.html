        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been grappling with significant challenges related to inhibitory control and overall executive function for years. Particularly troubling are symptoms akin to ADHD, such as poor attention and impulsivity. These issues have severely hampered my ability to establish even basic, positive habits. I sought guidance in the book &quot;Atomic Habits,&quot; hoping its strategies could assist in managing my executive dysfunction. However, I struggled to consistently apply these techniques. For instance, in an effort to reduce impulsivity, I removed junk food from my environment, only to impulsively reorder it, succumbing to cravings and poor impulse control.</p>

<p>Additionally, I attempted to apply the book&#39;s principles to develop exercise habits, like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), known to benefit ADHD. However, my motivation fluctuated wildly, leading to sporadic adherence rather than the planned four times a week routine. This inconsistency in prioritizing long-term goals, such as regular exercise, study habits, adequate sleep, and a healthy diet, has taken a toll. My inability to act in the best interest of my future self has led to a spiral of depression and self-doubt, further exacerbating my struggles with executive function.</p>

<p>My academic life has also suffered. Despite a deep interest in computer science and a strong desire to excel in this field, my inhibitory control issues have led to a lack of action. I&#39;ve missed numerous university sessions and have barely studied since starting my program. This lack of engagement is not due to a lack of care, but rather an inability to translate intention into action and CONSISTENTLY too. Persistency non-stop execution. </p>

<p>Moreover, my poor inhibitory control has contributed to an addictive personality, leading to dependencies on various forms of media, such as porn, YouTube, and social media platforms. Even after deleting TikTok and Instagram, I found myself addicted to YouTube. My inability to focus exacerbates this issue, as I often can&#39;t even maintain attention on longer videos.</p>

<p>This pattern of self-sabotage permeates all aspects of my life, stemming from my executive dysfunction. Seeking solutions, I&#39;ve considered prescription medication, but in the UK, options like Ritalin or guanfacine are expensive and have long waiting times for private prescriptions. Public health avenues, such as the NHS, offer little immediate hope due to extensive wait times. In my quest for alternatives, I discovered fasoracetam and pramiracetam, which my research suggests might offer some relief.</p>

<p>With exams approaching, the urgency to address these issues intensifies. Already, I&#39;ve missed quizzes and fallen behind in my computer science course. I&#39;m eager to learn coding and catch up with my peers, but my executive function challenges continue to be a significant barrier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With racetams the most wise answer is generally “maybe”. Unless the question is something like “what did this racetam do for you” </p>

<p>So maybe. Sorry to be kinda a downer but years ago, I’ve ordered so many nootropics expecting to have found the answer and been let down. </p>

<p>But racetams are just tricky you may be a non responder or maybe they’ll work great. I hope they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh I feel like I literally wrote this myself. Hope you find the right solution for you. This is absolutely no way to live and is completely destroying my life. I know how hard it is. Stimulant medication helped drastically for a while, but I haven’t been able to tolerate the side effects anymore physically and haven’t found anything else that actually works the same yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah same here.  The side effects are crazy.  A burst of productivity, energy, task efficacy, happiness, followed by a sudden anxious sense of doom, food tastes terrible, hard to sleep or even relax.</p>

<p>Been off the meds for two weeks now, life is slowly falling apart.  My girl is even talking breaking up cuz she’s so annoyed with how “distant” I am.  Room is chaotic. Etc etc.</p>

<p>Only a matter of time until I have to go back on them.  It sucks. F#ck ADHD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s like you’re screwed either way.  Either deal with these extreme side effects, or deal with a dysfunctional life….ultimately I choose the side effects ( although I take days off, sometimes a whole week)</p>

<p>Some people oddly take their meds everyday, get relief, and have little to no side effects or come down.  I don’t get it.  Often they have a terrible lifestyle too.</p>

<p>Here I exercise, hydrate, sleep, eat well, etc and still get horrible comedowns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn’t that’s how we all got here? </p>

<p>I’ve been in a long time and not even 9 mebc did it for me. I eventually learned it was about coping mechanisms and seeing how nootropics could help me cement them. 
I’m not saying you won’t but high expectations killed me so many times. But for me there’s no miracle noot just some helpful ones and some just fun to see what they’re like.
Take that for what you will i don’t mean it to be discouraging but a new way to find hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How did you take the 9-me-bc?  For me I never noticed anything orally.</p>

<p>Even sublingual doesn’t help the ADHD much per se, but it’s supposed to make it so you can regain some efficacy from your meds….also reduces the anhedonia from having to take a tolerance break.  </p>

<p>I actually noticed on day 8 of 9-me-bc I cut my Kratom use by over half, which was a huge accomplishment….I’ve been struggling to even get it down just 20%.</p>

<p>I’m still mid way through my cycle, I’m curious how the stimulant medication will affect me when I’m back on it….really hoping for the tolerance reduction people talk of.</p>

<p>But if nothing else, being able to reduce my Kratom use so much made it worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d snort it in multiple 3-6 mg doses up to thirty but usually fifteen-ish. Unless while on a stimulant it’s really not so great for me. I did go through a period of stacking with nsi 189 that was a good stack. On a stimulant or off it really mostly just feels like a mao an inhibitor. Like thh or harmine. And the rush from insulation also feels serotonergic to me.
I personally didn’t experience the hype and I don’t want to question people’s accounts but I really do wonder if there’s not a psychological element to some accounts. Every one can respond differently to any given noot but, it’s not a glutamatergic or anything where specific neurology might account for different responses. Inducing gdnf is pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>Now I’m not saying that for all people and i recall before I first tried it back like 2020 2019… when it was new I read a few accounts of tolerance reduction but they were taking it with stimulants concurrently.</p>

<p>Idk see how it goes. For me the best thing for efficacy has been time but different meds. If you have a cool doctor a cycle between mixed salts dextro and a very underrated med is focalin or dexmethylphenidate. I personally will not take methylphenidate at all in any form. It’s not great in the first place, time release forms only last four hours and a second dose just prolongs the comedown. For me atleast. Focalin is nothing like that is very smooth and you can take a second dose. It lacks the total focus everything else has but it gives you the motivation to try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some comments just send me down a rabbit hole, and yours was one of those.  Appreciate it.</p>

<p>I heard 9-me-bc could cause nose bleeds (which I’m prone to) so haven’t tried intranasal.  Had no idea there was any kind of rush to it either.  My psychonaut, recovered addict, Self may have to try this.</p>

<p>But tbh I was not expecting a buzz, much less a rush.  I was just looking to restore/ repair my dopamine.  My ADHD meds haven’t been working well lately, having anhedonia, and Kratom use is excessive.</p>

<p>It took about 8 days to feel better,.. but now I’m wondering how much is due to the MAOI, or  the dopamine repair.</p>

<p>I’m going to have to stop 9-me-bc in 2 weeks, so I’m worried about the anhedonia returning, along with my Kratom use.</p>

<p>The Harmala alkaloids actually look really interesting.  Glad you mentioned them…,I just ordered a bunch to experiment with.  If I feel like garbage again after stopping 9-me-bc, I’ll likely continue with the harmala alkaloids…,anything to stay off Kratom (crashes my testosterone)</p>

<p>9-me-bc seems most beneficial for people with fairly damaged/ down-regulated dopamine.  </p>

<p>I haven’t been taking my stimulants concurrently for now, want to fully repair things….but will need to go back on them soon…super curious if my tolerance actually went down though.</p>

<p>I’ve always wondered about cycling the meds too.  It is an option.  </p>

<p>Def agree about DexMethylphenidate being superior to Methylphenidate.  Methylphenidate had this weird combo of euphoria and dysphoria…,felt good and energetic, with this sense of doom in the background.  Horrible , panicky crash.</p>

<p>DexMethylphenidate IME is euphoric, a strong sudden burst of energy and focus, for about 30 min, followed by another 60 min of focus, and then a crash….not as bad a crash as Methylphenidate, but it still sucks.  Tbh it almost feels more recreational/ like a high, than functional…,I’m considering asking for the steady release version (not XR) called AzStarys.</p>

<p>But yeah DexMethylphenidate does lack the intense focus Amphetamine has, but it still helps.</p>

<p>Pure DextroAmphetamine Sulphate (Dexedrine, Zenzedi) looks like Adderall with less side effects….my last psychiatrist refused to discuss it, probably because I’m a former addict.  The reduced side effects increase the abuse potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ithat’s refreshing to hear from someone. In this community.</p>

<p>But yeah insulation really really really burns like none other. And it’s kinda tough you have to have a totally clear cavity. And I only call it a buzz because idk how else to describe it it’s not pleasant or unpleasant but it’s rapid. At the smaller doses it’s minor if existent around 3-5 mg but if you go like fifteen all at once there is some sort of pret strong psychoactive effect I guess you could compare it to nicotine with a low tolerance but only in three strength of effect. When I was having success I found that the smaller doses throughout the day were effective. I think I first decided to do it to avoid as much peripheral maoi as possible just based on a hunch.
Good for you with the kratom I’m almost done with a complete taber and it’s not bad but not pleasant.</p>

<p>Do your research on the harmalas I believe there documented serious benzo antagonists tremor and possibly deaths. 
I personally hardly tried tried harmine I just noticed a what I’m certain was raise in bp. Not much mentally. Thh was pretty interesting on the days it worked a general mood lift but still cardiovascular effects. </p>

<p>It really seems that my mao-a response is atypical. </p>

<p>I concure with all things methylphenidate related basically to a t.</p>

<p>And Dexedrine is ultimately superior to mixed salts. Almost like the methylphenidate topic. Really clear less hyperfocus snd most unpleasant effects of mixed salts.
Ultimately it’s still amphetamine and the same thing happens with tolerance and redosing turning into abuse and ultimately not sustainable for me.</p>

<p>I had a doctor that had me on 90 mg a day sometimes Dexedrine and adderall along with ambien ultimately abilfy and me checking into the mental hospital for the days. So I’m kinda at the point where I’ll take my sisters for tasks like moving or just things that I have no coping method for and still end up staying up all night and it’s really just there way it is for me and i accept it at this point but I stay goal oriented and once it’s complete it’s a few days in bed and like a week of normalization.</p>

<p>It’s just not a viable option for me as a chronic therapeutic. </p>

<p>Tbh I used to take psychedelics recreationally quite a bit when I was younger and I believed that there was therapeutic benefits for people I was skeptical of microdosing but about four months ago I was going through a rough transition and later realized I had been self sabotaging and constantly stressed and my friend had some really strong lsd and I just wanted to take a break from the stress no intention setting just wanted to get high on acid tbh but I had a pretty strong and uncomfortable trip but still fun to hang out and talk. And after I woke it was like all the stress clutter and a little bit more was routed out of my brain and I had a fresh look and got moved out and have been doing really well since. I still have struggles with mental health but there was a profound psychoplastic change. And I have done it a couple times since and really i have no next day fresh out look or mood lift. And that’s been there most beneficial experience with any substance I’ve ever had in my life. I can’t recommend it according to the rules and if anyone were to try explaining similar results I think that their chances might be limited. But not something to discount. 
I’ll just add that it it self wasn’t antidepressant but allowed me to make situational changes that ultimately were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about the harmalas.  9-me-bc is my first experience with a strong MAOI. I feel significantly better 3 weeks in.  I wonder how much is due to dopamine repair and how much is due to MAOI..,plus the Kratom taper seems to be bringing my testosterone back (my dead libido has come raging back )</p>

<p>Good to hear the psychedelic helped you.  I’m trying to plan a trip soon too.</p>

<p>For now even occasional THC seems (1-2x a week)  to give me some similar insights as psychedelics….just not as deep and it doesn’t have as much (if any) neuroplasticity benefits.</p>

<p>But give me some THC, music, and a journal and I’ll be writing out all kinds of deep , often buried, thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that’s what I asked myself about 9mebc and I think it’s the maoi effecta lot. But I sometimes would feel amazing only the next day so I think that it might not have been repair but the raise in gdnf tyrosine hydroxylase etc. also as an Maoi I actually felt really safe taking with amphetamine. Opposed to tetrahydroharmine I felt a lot of cardiac stress feelings alone. I actually responded to nootropics depots kava amazingly as a mao b inhibitor really stimulating and hardly gabaergic feeling compared other kava I’ve tried.  But it damaged my liver and I can’t take it. But I felt as close to 100 percent dopamineergicly as I have ever felt from a supplement or med.</p>

<p>And yeah good for you keep going I just finished my taper and really the last part really was only overactive bowels and it was easy from there no physical discomfort or hyperactive leg feeling. I noticed that sex drive part and it was strong like getting boners all the time lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agreed. I also think some of my experimentation with noots actually made some of my bad habits worse because I would use noots without backing them up with doing the work to change, so I wonder if the heightened neuroplasticity strengthened those negative connections instead of helping me form positive ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I’m sure that that’s what can happen. But once you recognize a pattern you can make efforts to either catch yourself and stop or if you can’t stop make the efforts to kinda shift is what I’ve learned. J 147 was really helpful in a way that it didn’t really induce or exacerbate bad habits but amplify positive experiences for me. And I started to take the steps to make those experiences happen again mostly pro social stuff.
I will say that bromantane is misunderstood it could really drive me to and strengthen bad habits my theory is that once the extra dopamine is there it’s going to express in circuits that it knows. I’ve honestly found it to be the most overrated nootropic  even though it’s one that I still take. And I usually do take it before a night at the bar to stay a lil more alert and enjoy the alcohol more. </p>

<p>I really rarely take nootropics anymore. I’m in a better life position to cope and then there are just some tasks I need to take some Dexedrine for I really hate to blame things on my adhd but large tasks or tasks with lots of moving parts I just can’t do without medication. And like I was saying there isn’t that miracle noot out there unless I could source selegeline. But that’s really a medication not a nootropic at base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t want to sound like a jerk, but you might want to consider therapy from a professional for procrastination. Or at the very least a study partner. Having someone in the corner cheering you on and giving you advice/pointers can really help things. </p>

<p>You seem to be very self-aware, which is absolutely fantastic! It’s very strong to be able to recognize and admit faults. Finding them is most of the battle. Now, all you have to do is to plan (ADHD nightmare) a way to beat them. I think you can do it with the right help. </p>

<p>Anyway, Racetams might help. Try ALCAR. If you don’t have theanine and a meditation protocol, they’d probably help. Anxiety is pretty prevalent in those with ADHD and can sometimes even have the same symptoms. Guanfacine and agmstine to a lesser extent targets both at once. Phosphatidylserine acts on a different mechanism but works well for some. </p>

<p>You’re in a fantastic spot to get rid of the executive dysfunction, OP. All you have to do, is do it. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as long as the Modafinil dose isn’t too high. After a few days I was side effect free at 50mg. Could potentially go up to 100mg without too many sides but I’ll keep it at 50mg for now. If you go above 100mg, then that’s when you may run into issues. I got prescribed 200mg of generic moda, I cut the pills into 4….so one bottle is like a 4 month supply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, brother in distress! I&#39;m experiencing the same symptoms, I don&#39;t know how much you know about ADHD, but you definitely have ADHD, bro... and possibly asd... they often go hand in hand with ADHD. But there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, as it turns out for me.
The following stack should help you, though:
- Microdosing amanita muscaria 2 grams in the morning. Very good for ADHD people, for we have a deficiency of GABA neurotransmitters.
- microdosing lion&#39;s mane, aka hericium erinaceus. 15 grams, there&#39;s no point in taking more than that, usually. Enhances the growth of neurons and their connections. It is desirable to drink with sunflower lecithin and sources of choline (choline will be needed in very large quantities, you can not stand to eat so much natural food), ideally you should take alpha gpc as a source of choline and not only. You can eat garlic additionally, the internet says it enhances the effect of lion&#39;s mane.</p>

<p>Well, and the racetams you mentioned, they help the brain to work better and more efficiently, students love racetams, and for good reason!
For the same discipline, it helps with ADHD to use omega 3-6-9, be sure to eat with something naturally fatty at the same time!
I really hope this really helps you, I know what it&#39;s like to live with ADHD and not be able to do what you should be doing, despite having to do it :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yeah. I recommend taking the Braverman test, it&#39;s a bit lengthy, but will take no more than half an hour of your time. It&#39;ll help you understand your neurotransmitter situation. Including GABA, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;re deficient in, as I am. That&#39;s not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is. Improving cognitive function, anxiety, arthritic pains and whatever else is never easy using natural medicine. It’s a trial and error process.</p>

<p>IMO there are just too many reasons someone might experience executive dysfunction. Personally I would bet it’s several vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well as chronic inflammation. Which compounds work best for everyone is different. </p>

<p>But I’d be willing to bet good money that the two nootropics OP has ordered won’t help.</p>
