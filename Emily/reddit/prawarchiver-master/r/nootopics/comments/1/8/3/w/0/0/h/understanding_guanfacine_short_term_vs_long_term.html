        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I figured this might be a good place to ask this because I really respect the scientific/pharmacological knowledge you all have on this subreddit</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently on Nardil (phenelzine) for social anxiety &amp; depression. It has been great for depression and the &quot;dread&quot; side of the social anxiety. I still have breakthrough social anxiety--physical and mental symptoms in situations like interviews (mind kinda going blank) and an overactive fight-or-flight, easy to startle/jumpy, etc. I think my norepinephrine response is fucked up lol. That&#39;s what led me to Guanfacine. If you ready on its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanfacine">Wikipedia article</a>, there&#39;s info on there about its anxiolytic properties: &quot;It appears to work by activating the Î±2A receptors in the brain, thereby decreasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system">sympathetic nervous system</a> activity.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyway, I was reading up on Guanfacine more because my doctor prescribed it to me. A couple of Reddit threads pinged my attention:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ut7mza/an_unofficial_guide_to_intuniv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">This thread basically said after 2 weeks-1 month Guanfacine changes into increasing norepeniphrine and thus Guanfacine is NOT a good anti-anxiety medication after the short term:</a>&quot;You&#39;ll see anxiety reduction as a function of confidence and energy, NOT as a decrease in sympathetic activity; the latter is just a temporary side effect, and you&#39;re better off seeking out medications that intend to do this primarily.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/180zaon/comment/kackvhk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">This recent comment on here says Guanfacine can be good for anxiety</a>: &quot;While it&#39;s true that guanfacine can inhibit NE release (this contributes to side effects like sleepiness), the beneficial effects on anxiety are due in large part to enhanced NE signaling in PFC.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is due to guanfacine&#39;s agonism of alpha-2A, which is a primarily postsynaptic subtype of the alpha-2 receptor. Alpha-2A receptors are expressed in PFC and by activating them, guanfacine can enhance working memory and attention. Additionally, the PFC connects to the amygdala and inhibits its fear responses&quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can someone help me understand whether Guanfacine is good for anxiety?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The first reddit thread kinda scared me--I don&#39;t really think I need more norepinephrine in my brain lol. I really don&#39;t understand all of the pharmacological/scientific stuff (but I&#39;m trying to learn it). Thank you so much in advance--I appreciate it</p>

<p>That is BS. Its about dopamine and norephedrine being not too high and not too low. If your norepinephrine tends to be too high than guanfacine will fine tune it to be a bit lower.</p>

<p>Besides that, even though it lowers norepinephrine, it does also activate a type of norepinephrine itself (2a).</p>

<p><strong>Functional selectivity(-&gt;Contextual Fear Memory):</strong><br/>
But for anxiety, clonidine paired with therapy is better. This is because of functional selectivity. Its specific functional selectivity makes clonidine be a key to open up the possibility to conciously reconfigure contextual fear memory. <em>Very useful with ptsd and other disease-states, where sufferers lack that inate ability</em>:<br/>
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01851-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01851-w</a></p>

<p>Im gonna do ask if I can get Clonidine prescribed to work as a catalyst for my EMDR therapy</p>

<p><strong>Partial vs Full agonism of a2a, and comborid effects with Agmatines allosteric modification:</strong>  </p>

<p>-<strong><em>Full agonism(guanfacine):</em></strong> Artificial bias inducer on norepinephrine release.<br/>
-<strong><em>Partial agonism(clonidine):</em></strong> Impacted most by endegenous feedback of norepinephrine.<br/>
-<strong><em>Allosteric modulation:</em></strong> Can enhance the effects of endegenous norepinephrine and partial agonism. </p>

<p><strong><em>Thus optimally, you can use Clonidine, with its prefered functional selectivity. And combine it with Agmatine, to induce an artificial bias on norepinephrine release, while also enhancing endegenous feedback. Fine tuned to your needs.</em></strong> And a low dose of Agmatine can be used to reduce the effects of inhibition by guanfacine as needed, if clonidine is not available.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01851-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01851-w</a></p>

<p>Dopamine needs to be balanced, not too high, partly because it affects a2a, prevents it from working. in adhd probably more so than normal people:<br/>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9578002/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9578002/</a></p>

<p>(Think of; the impact of clever timing a2a agonists before any d4 agonists(stimulants, endogenous rise in morning); using not too much of any d4 agonists; and of using d4 partial _ant_agonism)</p>

<p><em>This all will restore the buffer you once lost :).<br/>
Giving back the ability to perform optimally within a larger frame of environmental stress, before either anxiety or fatigue slaps you down</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. Nardil (MAOI) has been somewhat helpful for the mental effects of the fight/flight and my social anxiety, but it is not a silver bullet. Somewhat helpful for the dread aspect where I would dread situations that would elicit fight/flight (e.g. interviews). Still have breakthrough symptoms that I have to use propranolol, which helps the physical effects (shaky hands, unsteady voice, palpitations, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will warn you that trying to understand exact mechanisms of why some compound will or will not work for a particular psychological condition in a particular person is, at the current moment, a futile task. I will just say that Guanfacine significantly helped me with anxiety concomitant to PTSD. It is not a magic bullet, but the side effects are relatively minimal compared to the benefit (A little sleepiness, a paradoxical reduction in REM sleep that should be minimal, as well as blood pressure lowering). The most noticeable side effect is that it may make you more irritable. Guanfacine is more selective than clonidine and generally has fewer side effects.</p>

<p>The best way I can describe it is that Guanfacine helps calm the bodily response to anxiety significantly. It does not do as much for the psychological part of anxiety, but if you experience anxiety that triggers a panicked response in the body that, in turn, potentiates the anxiety, Guanfacine may help you. I would not recommend it to people who do not experience as many bodily symptoms of anxiety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do experience bodily symptoms of anxiety--shaky hands, shortness of breath, palpitations, etc.   </p>

<p>When you say it helped you with anxiety concomitant. to PTSD -- what dosage may I ask?   </p>

<p>And medications may help the psychological part of anxiety?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started at 1mg once a day in the morning and eventually moved to 2mg. I prefer morning administration because you get the acute anxiolytic effect during the day, and the drowsiness went away when I took it consistently at the same time for some number of days. I have not tried higher doses. I have a friend who takes 4-5mg a day for ADHD, so the dosage seems pretty variable on how it affects you and what you can tolerate. It definitely has a stronger effect for the first week or two, but your brain adapts to it and it has fewer side effects, but perhaps a little less anxiety reduction as well. It also improves focus if you have ADHD and is approved as an ADHD medication.</p>

<p>I do not take any other medications for anxiety at the moment. Guanfacine doesn&#39;t affect your personality as much as traditional antidepressants and anxiolytics, for better or for worse. </p>

<p>If you have panic attacks, beta blockers are very effective for calming the heart rate and nervousness, but they do even less for the psychological part of anxiety in my experience. I&#39;d describe it as a spectrum from antidepressants/anxiolytics -&gt; alpha 2 agonists -&gt; beta blockers in terms of how much they affect the mental versus the physical aspects of anxiety.</p>
