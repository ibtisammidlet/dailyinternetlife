        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Prices for SAM-e are reasonably high considering how ubiquitous and prevalent a supplement it is. To me it seems to work as a general bandaid and prevent a lot of other issues cascading. </p>

<p>I have been daily using it for a few years now and would like to keep enjoying its mild but significant effects as long as possible.  The only issue for me is the pricepoint I am buyiny it at. I already buy in bulk, but still end up paying 150-200 euros for a 6 month supply. So I was interested in combining other methylation agents with something mildly seratonergic/anxiolytic. </p>

<p>The big issue here is that I am an ok methylator, not over, nor under when looking at genotype. So a lot of the methylation agents that promote seratonin uptake, while still enhancing dopaminergic functions,  like methylfolate, have a glass ceiling for me. Taking them at more than half a dose starts to introduce a relative amount of anxiety. My workaround for this is to take it with either glycine, taurine, cbd bud smoked. (on a side note, alpha gpc and cdp choline are wonderful with high dose cbd, little to no irritability or depression from excess choline with a strong antidepressant effect going on there)</p>

<p>I was wondering if a combination of maybe l-tryptophan, which on its own makes me pretty damn sleepy, with methylfolate or TMG can mimick the effects of SAMe more closely. Alternatively maybe use l-methionine with the folate or tmg and see if that balances out, but l-methionine in increased doses causing neuroinflammation is giving me doubts about this combo producing reliable effects that would work long term.</p>

<p>Glycine, taurine, l-tryptophan are all my preffered sups to modulate the effects (that I can use daily as I am not able to smoke my CBD every morning before going into work due to the smell :( ..), also looking into combining serine with glycine to see how strong that nootropic/anxiolytic effect can be.</p>

<p>If anybody likes similar sups (maybe has a similar neurochemistry) and can help me where to look, it would be much appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also legit stuff, I already ordered from there.</p>

<p>Pipingrock is also cheap if you need encapsulated sam-e and they are using also enteric coating.</p>

<p>Please be aware that it&#39;s a bit difficult to handle sam-e powder. It reacts at the air and start to degrade to liquid.</p>
