        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used ChatGPT to make my writing better. Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read this.</p>

<p>Hello. I am currently suffering from side effects that began after I took two doses of three medications: Abilify, agotine, and topiramate. I took them for approximately a month and a half and abruptly stopped without tapering off.</p>

<p>Around two hours after the first doses, I felt an intense high, accompanied by agitation and hallucinations. I had never experienced such sensations before. People passing by also commented that I appeared as though I were under the influence of drugs.</p>

<p>From the second day onwards, I started bexperiencing severe issues. Firstly, I noticed a complete change in my mental state. It&#39;s difficult to explain, but it felt as though my mind had become flat. Previously, I was a musician and possibly an artist, but now I feel significantly worse, lacking any dynamism or character.</p>

<p>After that day, I began losing many things, including my memories, thoughts, feelings, and musical abilities (which used to be my greatest strength). I was an exceptional guitarist before, but now I can hardly play at all because the connection to sound and music has disappeared from within me. I felt my life was lost, I was completely lost, and I still have that feeling.</p>

<p>I have also developed tardive dyskinesia, which causes abnormal movements when I&#39;m stressed (particularly in social situations). Additionally, I&#39;ve experienced akathisia, short-term memory loss (to the extent that I can&#39;t remember what I saw just two seconds ago), and constant feelings of suicidal ideation. I also feel as though I&#39;ve aged significantly and that life no longer holds any colors or impressions for me. Furthermore, I perceive that my facial appearance has changed in a negative manner.</p>

<p>In an attempt to find relief, I started purchasing numerous supplements based on information I gathered from various websites, mostly through anecdotal accounts. </p>

<p>These are the supplements that I currently have :
Thorne - Niacinimide, 5htp, Iso-phos
Nootropics depot - Ashwaganda, uridine, vitamin E
Now - Ginkgo, NAC, L-tryptophan, Beta alanine
Life extention - PQQ, cistsanche
Others -

<p>How should I take these supplements? Which ones should I take, at what dosages, and in which combinations and timings? </p>

<p>I also have some supplements on the way, but I can&#39;t recall all of them anymore.</p>

<p>I am willing to do whatever it takes to heal. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Below 6mg it partially antagonizes opiate receptors for about two hours then the body responds by releasing 3x the normal endorphins. It can counteract the fatigue that APs naturally cause.</p>

<p>Only caveat is if you are on opiates then you can’t take it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selank mostly blocks the metabolization of enkaphalines, including endogenous opiates. For that reason partially it is being used in Russian pharmacology into opiate and alcholol treatment along other things. This mode-of-action should be non-addictive as such. </p>

<p>That is part of Selank anxiolytic mechanism, but there are epigenetic things in it also to appear and last for long term.</p>

<p>Other substances to do the same are Semax peptide, and then D-phenylalanine present in D,L-Phenylalaine combo what comes out if you manufacture Phenylalanine synthetically (from foodstuffs you get only L-phenylalanine).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what it has even higher affinity for than opioid receptors is TLR4 the antagonism of which reduces inflammation. also low doses are pretty good with opioids actually and help maintain higher chronic effects. 2-6mg might be a bit too much to just add right away if one has already been taking opioids for a while tho ofc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I started taking them simultaneously. I was probably depressed, had some panic attacks, and maybe had some other minor problems. I guess I was very stressed out in a way, but I was still living a satisfying life. I was a very good guitarist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>St. Johns Wort could be dropped if taking loads of other supplements.</p>

<p>Its mode-of-action is to affect certain liver enzymes, and it may nullify the effect of many other things in your stack it is said. Or mayby to enhance them into dangerous levels - not heard that but possible.</p>

<p>One doctor when briefly discussing about supplements warned about St Johns Wort in particular that it is tendencious to inflict liver damage in interactions with other substances.</p>

<p>But if you take it into clean head without anything else, then on-par or superior to SSRI mediciations.</p>

<p>One mode-of-action of it is that it contains amentoflavone what has bunch of cool effects, but Ginkgo Biloba has it too, so that can serve as replacement of St. Johns Wort for that certain part of its effects.</p>

<p>Since that plant or herb blooms in trenches and roadsides and meadows in many places here I used to gather and dry it and throw it into my stack. Not anymore after learning all this, so I have big bags of that thing dried perpetually unused. One thing of that herb is that if you pluck flowers of it when being fresh, skin in your hands gets purple spots where it touches or wherein phytochemicals are absorbed. And it wont go away when washing hands for couple days, and how your hands appear after picking one plastic bag full of that herb gives good scare for other people afterwards. Apparently phytochemicals are pretty strong in it, and issue with photosensitivity on your skin after using that should be taken seriously if their effects really is so colorful as I experienced.</p>
