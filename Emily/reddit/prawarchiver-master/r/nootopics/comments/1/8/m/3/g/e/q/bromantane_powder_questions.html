        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just gifted with a 5 gram jar of 99% bromantane powder. I hope you will give me some suggestions as to how to start using it. I am a 77yr old ancient ager and have a great diet, work out, have had good results with &quot;noots&quot; especially with microdosing. My main objective with bromantane would be getting a little more physical energy. So here&#39;s my quick questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What would be a good starting dose and should I begin with just once per day or do more? I understand that it&#39;s best to start with a morning dose.</p></li>
<li><p>I have read that it might be good to take it with olive or MCT oil? I do good with sublingual and have no problem holding it for 20 minutes if needed, with or without oil? I don&#39;t do well with nasal because of some severe nasal damage so that&#39;s out for me.</p></li>
<li><p>I enjoy a light caffeine drink in the morning, would it be okay to keep doing that with bromantane?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any other supplements and/or tips, that you would suggest with my bromantane dosing?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Big thanks in advance for any suggestions. And big alohas and all the best to all my Nootopics friends too!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know for me, it&#39;s much easier to dose something like that once it&#39;s in solution. </p>

<p>Bromantane is lipid soluble, so I put 1.5 grams into 30ml of olive oil, then I can dose 50mg/ml with a dropper. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an absolute must-have for me before the gym now. It makes all the difference in the world. Most days I&#39;ll take 50mg in the AM (5-6am-ish) to get my butt in gear, then another 50mg about 30 minutes before I go to the gym (anywhere from 3-5pm depending on the day). </p>

<p>I would definitely take it slow getting started out. Took me a couple days to get used to it, and it can cause some insomnia at first. </p>

<p>Good luck, have fun, and I hope I can be just like you when I grow up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for the quick reply and good suggestions! On thing I wanted to make sure I am understanding correctly is do you hold your olive oil bromantane solution sublingually for a while or just swallow the drops? </p>

<p>Another thanks for the comment about being just like me when you grow up! Although, I hope you are way better than me when that happens! And actually, I am still trying to grow up and hope to be way better myself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sorry! Guess I should have clarified. </p>

<p>I actually use empty Capsules. Just dump 1ml of the solution in a &quot;00&quot; sized capsule and down the hatch. You could probably get away with it sublingual. I&#39;ve just never tried it myself. I HAVE used a bromantane nasal spray, but I seem to respond better to taking it orally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got the best out of using it sublingually, dissolved in olive oil. Higher bioavailability with that route of administration.</p>

<p>Seriously takes like 48 hours to fully dissolve, periodically shaking the dropper bottle. Bromantane is completely flavorless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had quite a unique experience with insuffalated bromantane.  The effects have lasted for months.  Coming from my personal experience, I can only recommend trying a 3-5 day cycle (one 5-10mg insuff dose per day) and then give yourself at least 2 weeks to really get an idea of whether or not it has had an effect.  It upregulates the enzymes responsible for dopamine synthesis.  Goes much further than just primary receptor effects (how most drugs work)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really appreciate the quick reply and will take your cycle advice to heart. One thing though, I cannot do insuffalated so would you have any specific suggestion for the amount I should start with doing it sublingually? No problem if not as it may not be something that you can easily compare dose amounts. </p>
