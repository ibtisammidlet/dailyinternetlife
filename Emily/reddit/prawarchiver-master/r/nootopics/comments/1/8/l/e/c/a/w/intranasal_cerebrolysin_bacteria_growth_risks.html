I know most people say that it&#39;s good up until 2 weeks, but is there chance of bacteria growing in it during those 2 weeks? Would it be a good idea to mix it with some nasal spray that has chemicals in it to prevent bacteria growth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend storing nasal sprays in two Ziploc bags, with desiccant in each bag, in the refrigerator. I noticed when I was storing nasal sprays in the fridge they would grow bacteria around the spray nozzle, so I put it in the ziplock bag and it still started to appear after a while so I put in two ziplock bags and it never appeared. Also it doesn&#39;t hurt to use an alcohol swab on the nozzle before and after use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is definitely a risk, no question about it. in fact not only cerebro is a risk and never without chances to contain some deadly-level bacteria but also every single day is a risk and not without chances of terrible bacteria overgrowth and/or death.

    <div class="md"><p>i was just kidding brother. it is 99.9% far fetched. it was just weird to me that fear neurosis is growing too much.  nothing terrible will happen to you even with contaminated cerebro which is by itself probably a very very rare thing. nobody will die from it. worst very rare case scenario is some kind of infection that will pass.  the whole point. it is absolutely not worth your anxieties, fears, concerns, contemplations, ruminations over and over again.. as it is the case with basically all big fears/anxieties.  but one can&#39;t do much about it whatever he says, it is a pretty damn stable tendency of psyche/personality.  that&#39;s sad.  waste of life quality on so much fears that have so little chance to happen.  even if chances are big, high anxiety/concerns/fear is useless.  problems without redemption, problems of human condition.    but what do i know, do what you like</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can get contaminated this is why it’s important to A) order the smaller amps so they you going through a fresh amp relatively fast once it’s opened B) storing the sprayer in a baggie or two away from food.

    <div class="md"><p>I put about 1% Benzyl alcohol in my nasal sprays. It’s a bacteriostatic preservative and typically used for this purpose, as far as I know. Never had any problems with bacteria when using it, not even long term (more than half a year). And make sure you use sterile water when mixing your nasal spray, in case it’s not pre-mixed.</p>
