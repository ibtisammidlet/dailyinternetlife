        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I started experimenting with Alpha GPC earlier this year at a low dose. I gradually increased to around 1200mg, which triggered the darkest form of suicidal depression I have ever experienced. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through that again! It made me believe the only way out of the darkness was to end myself. </p>

<p>It was so terrifying that I no longer take choline supplements at all, not even with my racetams (aniracetam) in case it triggers another depressive episode. I don&#39;t recall having a headache since then, but even if I did, I wouldn&#39;t go near a choline supplement again.</p>

<p>In case anyone wonders where I get my dietary choline from I follow a carnivore diet and consume liver daily in small doses to get my choline.</p>

<p>To make matters more confusing, I also cannot take L-Tyrosine anymore. It used to work well as part of my preworkout stack dosed at 500mg and helped with anxiety and focus for work. However, after the Alpha GPC-induced depression, L-Tyrosine would focus me at the gym (taken on an empty stomach) in the morning, but then I would progressively become depressed and moody after, although not as severely as with the Alpha GPC. Thank God! It would only last about a day. </p>

<p>All that being said, I have read positive things about Uridine and ALCAR, and even better things about stacking the two together. They seem to benefit verbal fluency and make for a great pre-workout addition. I have researched extensively on Reddit and YouTube, and it seems that both can have anywhere from neutral to amazing effects. I have heard that Uridine can be used indefinitely and helps promote neurogenesis, making it great for language acquisition. ALCAR I believe can also be used indefinitely which make both ideal for my work and training. </p>

<p>My only concern is that I have read one or two comments about people experiencing depression with either nootropics. These comments are in the minority and are overshadowed by the positive literature and videos, but it still gives me pause for concern.</p>

<p>ALCAR increases acetylcholine synthesis, which could be concerning for someone who don&#39;t do well with high levels of choline. On the other hand, Uridine, from what I have read, partly converts to AcetylCholine, raising similar concerns as mentioned for ALCAR.</p>

<p>If I have any of this science wrong, please correct me.</p>

<p>My question is: given my predisposition to choline depression, do you think it&#39;s worthwhile for me to try Uridine or ALCAR, or both, as part of my daily work stack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was elsewhere in Reddit hypothesis on choline precursor induced depression on the idea, that free choline somewhat interacts with alpha7 acetylcholine receptor already and problem is connected with that. Acetylcholine goes to all receptors simultaneosly, and some of them like alpha4 make you feel strong in the nerves or at least balance the effect out. </p>

<p>This would explain why choline precursors make people typically melancholic, but then again something like Coluracetam what sucks choline into cells effectively in order to turn it into acetylcholine to boost its levels works against even treatment resistant depression. Because free choline from blood is taken away at faster rate into acetylcholine form what acts differently. </p>

<p>For me those wild guesses and hypotheses sound like something of a plausible explanation for paradoxic mystery of this. </p>

<p>ALCAR is no precursor of choline, taking it does not increase free choline in bloodstream. But it may act similarly getting free choline out from your blood more rapid rate in order to turn it into acetylcholine. Generally there is much less reports on choline depression on ALCAR rather than from choline precursor forms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great explanation!</p>

<p>So you essentially want to remove the free choline to prevent it from acetalizing in the wrong place or overloading on the nerves.</p>

<p>This makes me think that if you did have a problem with ALCAR you could always stack it with a racetam to prevent any possible depression. That would preclude it from an everyday stack which is what I am searching for.</p>

<p>Is the interaction between Uridine and ALCAR beneficial or is there no interaction to speak of?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that actually be more likely to use up choline, instead of adding to it? Would love to hear your thoughts, I take both regularly. Thank you!</p>
