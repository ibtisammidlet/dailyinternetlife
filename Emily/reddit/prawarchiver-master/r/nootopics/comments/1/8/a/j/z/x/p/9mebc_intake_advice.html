        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello community!</p>

<p>I  got myself some 9-me-bc to combat my anhedonia, depression and fatigue... I only  later figured out that there is lots of controversy on whether it is  safe and what substances may be beneficial or problematic in combination  with it. I still want to give it a try since I&#39;ve read many positive  reports on it, and since I am desperate enough to take some risks...</p>

<p>Based on what I have read, this is the stack I want to try for the next 20 days:</p>

<ul>
<li>5mg 9-ME-BC sublingually, dissolved in 1ml PEG 400</li>
<li>500 mg Vit C liposomal as an antioxidant</li>
<li>40 mg Zinc-Gluconate as an antioxidant</li>
<li>800 mg NAC for liver protection</li>
<li>300 mg milk thistle seed powder for liver protection</li>
<li>650 mg Lion’s Mane extract for neuroprotection</li>
<li>100 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine for neuroprotection</li>
<li>Omega 3: 500mg EPA, 250mg DPA, triglyceride form: for anti-inflammatory effects</li>
<li>50mg Curcumin for for anti-inflammatory effects</li>
<li>2000 IU Vitamin D3 for overall health</li>
<li>125 mg Niacin flush variant to reduce methyl groups</li>
<li>0,15 g psilocybin mushrooms 3x per week for antidepressive effects</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think about this stack? Do you see anything that might be problematic or that might be missing?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve  also read that it is very caustic and burns your oral cavity, so I  wonder what can be done to reduce these negative side effects. I have just ordered  <em>PEG 400</em>  as a solvent for 9-ME-BC, since I have seen that some vendors sell it  as a liquid, solved in PEG400. My plan is to dissolve 5mg 9-ME-BC  dissolved in 1ml PEG400 and take it sublingually. Does that seem sound  to you?</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>muhnbuht</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>UPDATE 23.12.2023:<br/>
I&#39;ve been taking 5 mh 9-ME-BC every morning since about 2 weeks now, and I am pausing it over the christmas holidays. This is my experience so far:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<ul>
<li>It dissolves very well in PEG 400. I dissolved 15mg in 1 ml.</li>
<li>In this mixing ratio it doesn&#39;t burn in my mouth, it still feels rather unpleasent and negatively effects my sense of taste. Especially coffe tastes awful even hours after taking it.</li>
<li>It gives a feeling of alertness, that comes pretty quickly and lasts for a few hours. Heart rate  goes a bit up after taking it.</li>
<li>It still didn&#39;t improve my cognitive performance, rather the opposite. I have more brain fog with 9-ME-BC than without.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not sure  wheter I will continue taking it since I didn&#39;t experienceany positive effects from it.</p>

<p>What is your experience - should I be expecting positive effects after two weeks? Or did it take longer for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was desperate too and I took the chance with 9-me-bc.  </p>

<p>I couldn’t even get out of bed and basic tasks felt downright painful.  </p>

<p>I’m incredibly glad I did.  I used much more than you (30 mg also Sublingual for 20 minutes every day.)</p>

<p>There’s no high or stimulant feeling IME, but I can get out of bed now, do basic tasks, not feel a chronic sense of doom, etc.  Basically I just feel like I should feel.</p>

<p>My life is good, there’s no environmental reason I should be anhedonic.</p>

<p>I dramatically cut back my excessive Kratom use too, almost effortlessly.  My previously low libido has come raging back…,I’m not sure if this is from cutting the Kratom or the MAOI properties.</p>

<p>The burning under your tongue is unpleasant, but I remind myself that a life of anhedonia is much worse.</p>

<p>I still have most my taste, some people do lose taste.  </p>

<p>I tried oral ROA last year, and I didn’t notice anything, but sublingual I do.</p>

<p>I’m on day 25 of a 40 day cycle.  I’m kinda scared to stop taking it, I really hope the improvement remains.</p>

<p>Although I also take prescription DexMethylphenidate 5 days a week, so that may have contributed.  It’s barely working lately.</p>

<p>Over two years of monitoring my hormones, whenever my Kratom use is too high, My Prolactin Spikes and testosterone crashes.  I get super lethargic and crave comfort.  Not good.</p>

Do what you may, but I did not enjoy the taste which ultimately led to my amplified awareness of the dangers of 9-mbc. So I discontinued</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s a matter of how desperate you are.</p>

<p>Last year I tried 9-me-bc and ultimately gave up cuz of the burning (tried oral ROA, didn’t work.)</p>

<p>This year things were so bad, I decided 20 minutes of burning a day was much better than Anhedonia and fatigue all day long</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it is worse when I first place it. </p>

<p>But I feel it mildly burn the whole 20 minutes.  And then for a few more minutes after swallowing.</p>

<p>What’s actually more annoying though is trying to not swallow all the saliva pooling up.</p>

<p>How long do you hold it for?</p>

<p>My technique of getting it under my tongue properly has improved a lot, which does make it easier</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ok makes sense. The way you said it I thought that you were like in pain the whole time. I also do a max of 20 minutes. And yeah some burn after swallowing. Right, the pool of saliva can be a nuisance; keeping mouth closed, or sometimes head tilted back or teeth clamped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tips….I never even thought to keep my mouth closed. Tried it today and it helped a lot.</p>

<p>I’ve also found first thing in the morning when you wake up dehydrated there seems to be less saliva production….or after a workout too.</p>

<p>How many days do you cycle it?  How long do the benefits last for you when you stop?  </p>

<p>I’m so worried about losing all these benefits quickly after stopping.  Feeling normal actually feels great after feeling like garbage for so long.</p>

<p>There’s a few other sites that have it too….Ive got it from Chemyo before ..,,Chemyo’s 9-me-bc burns more than science.bio’s.  Not sure if that means it’s less pure, or if it means it’s stronger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only use it in one month cycle.  We don’t know if it’s safe, or even effective, to take longer.</p>

<p>But yeah every day, preferably in the morning, for 30 days.</p>

<p>I used 30 mg per day.  Some people use less (15-20 mg)</p>

<p>Yes I’d try to use it before you exam….it improved my memory and focus.</p>

<p>However your exam is far enough that you can do a cycle now, take a two month break, and then do another cycle.</p>

<p>Here’s the biggest trick to making 9-me-bc work:  You need to learn to hold it under your tongue for 15-20 minutes.  No swallowing.  This is surprisingly difficult at first and may take a few attempts to get right.  You don’t want saliva to pool up under your tongue….this dilutes it and makes it very difficult not to swallow.</p>

<p>So the best time to use it is upon waking up….youre a bit dehydrated and your mouth is dry….this makes it easier to hold it.  Also clamp your teeth and keep your mouth shut.  Don’t tilt your head forward (tilt it slightly back.)</p>

<p>I know that sounds like a pain, and it is, but if you do it right, 9-me-bc is one of the best nootropics out there.</p>

<p>Expect to notice an easier time getting motivated, better verbal fluency, high libido, and more.</p>

<p>Research potential side effects too, especially be careful in the sun.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My exam is on June 8, my grades are average, I am willing to study, but I cannot continue regularly and consistently. When I only study for a week, I cannot work for a week. If I exert myself, I get very sleepy, but when I play games, I never get sleepy...  </p>

<p>I want to work, I have to work and I love working, but even though I am so willing, studying makes me sleepy. No matter how well I sleep, I feel sleepy 1-2 hours after I start studying. My body is holding me back. Long time ago I set an alarm at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning every day to solve math problems. I was able to comply with it for the first 2-3 days, but then I started to have a hard time staying up in the morning.  </p>

<p>I bought 300mg 9-mbc from Science Bio. How can I use this 300mg most effectively?  </p>

<p>If I were to take 30mg daily, I need 900mg of 9-MBC :(  </p>

<p>I think I will take 10mg daily. Would this be too little? I can do 2 cycles, I can take the last 15 days before my exam and I can take the other 15 days 2 months before my exam.  </p>

<p>9-How long does the effect of mbc last? 1 day? 2 days? 1 week?  </p>

<p>If you were me, how would you use 300mg 9-mbc?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I asked too many questions. Your answers are very valuable to me ❤️</p>

<p>I’ve been taking various nootropics for over 2 years, spent $3,000-4,000 on all kinds.  This has been the most impressive by far.</p>
