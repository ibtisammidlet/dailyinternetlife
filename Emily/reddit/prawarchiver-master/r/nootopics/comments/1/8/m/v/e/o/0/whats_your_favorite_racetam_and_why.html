<p>Of the ones I’ve tried:</p>

<p>Phenylpiracetam: most noticeable uplift. Not good for daily use.</p>

<p>Fasoracetsm: relaxing easy focus</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t “feel” anything IME.</p>

<p>It’s mainly just a memory boost (at least for me)</p>

<p>My job requires a strong working short term memory, and I noticed a mild improvement on it after 3 weeks of piracetam, and after 2 weeks of Oxiracetam.</p>

<p>Without my job I probably would have had no way of knowing it was doing anything, unless you purposely take some short term memory tests before and after.</p>

<p>Haven’t tried the others yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenylpiracetam - it improves mental focus and physical performance for example a heavy set of 10 on squats feels like a walk in the park. Lung capacity improves and I don’t over exert on it, heartbeat seems to be more stable under physical stress. Also seems to make me stress resistant whether physical or mental, another thing I noticed is that I don’t feel cold or warm on it. Overall it’s my favourite !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m primarily looking for a stimulant/mood booster for exercise that doesn’t have significant cross-tolerance to amphetamine-type drugs.

    <div class="md"><p>Phenylpiracetam, i just use a 5mg scoop full, put under the tounge and i feel the effect, more alert, my brain work better, i&#39;m more focused, i&#39;m in 5 days in a row no tolerance....if I encrease the amount I think i&#39;m going to encreise the effect but for me is good like this, i want to use daily...the effect last few hours, I did a full 5mg scoop 3 times, sometims i add 5mg of noopept, but i think PP is more powerful.</p>

<p>when I use it I go out and stay out so i cannot redose, I think if i bring the jar with me i&#39;m going to redose too often, so i want to stick to 3 dose of pheny and if i want a bit more push i can add some noopept</p>

<p>I was surprised this ittle amount has a good effect, i&#39;m more talktive, it was what  looking for, i feel more secure in social contest, I feel smarter...I&#39;m less dumber :-)</p>

<p>I hope this daily routine continue for long time and hope no side effect because I feel smarter</p>

<p>fasoractam make me tired, i get it a bit one time beetwen dosing of PP</p>

<p>I have coluracetam and oxiracetam and aniracetam, but didn&#39;t take those at moment, it was a purchase did a year ago, and now I just want to retry, and phenyl is good in this way, it can be placebo? I don&#39;t think so because are few days in a row, usually after 2 o 3 days i feel normal, but at the moment i feel the push...let&#39;s see</p>

<p>one thing i notice I talk more loudly and I have more disinibition, and even more generosity, one night i pay few drinks and spent more money than usual...I don&#39;t have the usual brake on things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you mean if I had an accident where i hit the head like car accident, no</p>

<p>if you mean hit by the phenylpiracetam like a potent effect like a rush, no<br/>
i feel easy to speak and better recall of past memory long and recent things, i can express my self better</p>

<p>One thing I notice that all the time something works I think: cause it works I&#39;m going to be perfect always be right always be smart and say the right thing....actually I become more right more reasonable but I&#39;m alway prone to error and misjujment even if the pjanyl make me better, don&#39;t aspct to be perfect, nobody nor god is perfect, but i&#39;m better, or i think i&#39;m</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been diagnosed with adhd and I do believe the diagnosis is correct as my baseline executive functioning is atrocious. However, I don’t respond well to most stimulants. In fact most of them make my executive functioning worse. Fasoracetam is unique in that while it’s not a stimulant, it seems to truly get to the bottom of my executive functioning issues. With time it improves my ability to sustain attention, plan and organize. It also improves my working memory, sense of time and emotional control. I believe my executive dysfunction stems from some type of mGluR mutation as Fasoracetam is more effective for me (in most ways) than FDA approved medication. Although Fasoracetam still has its downsides. It can be somewhat anxiogenic when first starting it. It doesn’t provide much of any mental energy or motivation. It also noticeably blunts my orgasms. This has been reported by other people as well. I’m guessing for many people that’s going to be a dealbreaker.</p>

<p>I asked because I too was diagnosed with ADHD and I also didn&#39;t get good results with traditional medication.</p>

<p>I already tried Fasoracetam, but I felt a little apathetic and for that reason I didn&#39;t insist much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. A lot of Noots make me irritable and I live in a fairly consistent state of anxiousness. But in rare moments of freedom from anxiety I am almost always in a natural flow state of wonderfulness. Most Noots that address anxiety effectively for me either make me sleepy which is a no no for my occupation or they build tolerance to quickly. Any help available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nefiracetam is clearly one of most intresing existing one. </p>

<p>Only it creates some degree of initial drowsiness due of GABA increase, what you adopt at some part what some people may consider as drawback. Good though, for booze / benzo / phenibut withdrawal though I guess...? </p>

<p>In my opinion best racetam you get when you combine Nefi what is sedating, but capable to stimulate abstract thinking and verbalics and neurogenesis at deep level with some other racetam what has more stimulant edge in it. That is very synergistic combo then...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fasoracetam 🥇
It’s the only one that gives good focus effects without being over stimulatory also the best for social situations .  Aniracetam comes close second and has more prominent focus and memory effects but not as anxiolytic and good socially.</p>
