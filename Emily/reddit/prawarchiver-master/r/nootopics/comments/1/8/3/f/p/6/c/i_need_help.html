        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Long story short, I&#39;ve been addicted to opioids and daily dosing mostly kratom but got a month or 2 ODSMT, and I&#39;ll occasionally do like half of what I&#39;m pretty sure is a fent pressed M30.</p>

<p>I&#39;m over this addiction and I want out of it. What&#39;s the best nootropics I can take to get me through WDs? Is it okay to cold turkey? I&#39;m taking around 40 grams of kratom a day. I&#39;m going to buy some pregabalin and clonidine, I&#39;ve seen studies about them helping opioid withdrawal. What else should I get? I can get pretty much any non scheduled medication,  and almost any RC if any of those might help. I&#39;ve thought about buying dipyanone since it&#39;s an analogue of methadone and lasts like 2 days but I don&#39;t want to risk just getting addicted to that.
So please, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Even from you, Sirsadalot ;)</p>

<p>Edit:
Thank you to all who replied with advice, I&#39;m going to purchase alot of the things recommended to me here tomorrow and will be stopping the opioids when it all arrives.
I genuinely appreciate you all, and you have made me feel as though I really am going to be able to get through this
 Thank you again, much love.</p>

<p>NAC, BSO/thymoquinone, NA-selank, perhaps cerebrolysin/cortexin, high/frequent dose vitamin c.</p>

<p>Neboglamine and LDN afterward may help you not to relapse. </p>

<p>Tapering instead of CT will probably go easier, especially with a good stack. Careful with pregabalin as to not replace one addiction with another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently in a similar situation, although just with Kratom.</p>

<p>My use spiraled out of control, up to 70 + grams per day, which is extreme.</p>

<p>My prolactin spiked up, my testosterone crashed, and I felt terrible….and the quickest way to feel better was more Kratom.  I couldn’t even get out of bed and do basic tasks without a fresh dose in my system.</p>

<p>My ADHD meds also weren’t working well anymore.  2 hours of energy followed by a brutal crash.  I thought it was tolerance, and that may be part of it, but it was probably also the low testosterone.</p>

<p>I set to take a stimulant tolerance break, and read about 9-me-bc significantly helping repair damage.  As a bonus, it also lowered Prolactin.</p>

<p>Something shocking happened around day 8 of my 9-me-bc cycle.  I got out of bed no problem.  Made breakfast no problem.  Totally forgot about the Kratom.  </p>

<p>Eventually I realized I missed the dose but decided to push it.  I started getting some muscle tension and RLS, which I alleviated with a 2 gram dose (significantly lower than my usual 5-10 gram doses).</p>

<p>I cut my Kratom use by over half that day, down to 30 GPD.  Since then it’s been a week and I’ve maintained this Lower dose, and trying to go lower.</p>

<p>I had no idea the 9-me-bc had anti addictive properties (at least IME) and I’m ecstatic.  Much less desire to vape and Zyn too.</p>

<p>I’ve been making a game with myself to keep getting my Kratom lower and lower.  I weigh every dose, write it down, then total it at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I’ve been pushing myself in other ways.  </p>

<p>Exposing myself to the cold without a jacket is incredibly uncomfortable, but pushing through it gives me a feeling of mental strength.  At first I feel miserable and uncomfortable, but after a while this surge of strength comes up, it almost feels animalistic.</p>

<p>When I’m out running I’ll pick a far away pole or mailbox, and force myself to sprint to it full throttle.  It’s super painful, my body is begging to stop, but my mind overpowers it….. and let me tell you it proves to yourself how much mental strength you really have.</p>

<p>Be creative in ways you can push your mental strength.  </p>

<p>Best of luck brother, and fuck opioids….they make you crave comfort, and we should be craving adventure and accomplishment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last line is dope; exactly. </p>

<p>There’ll always be times where we wish, more than anything we could have that easy ticket to comfort. But being able to push through those uncomfortable moments, until we’re strong enough that they aren’t uncomfortable anymore makes us thrive as people. You won’t ever strengthen that part of yourself and grow when you have in the back of your mind, an easy ticket to comfort. You have to create comfort within yourself. Being able to be comfortable in times where you’re supposed to be uncomfortable just from pure confidence in your self is a feeling that can’t be matched.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  And nothing gives comfort like opioids.  Then they raise your prolactin and lower your testosterone, which makes you crave more comfort (I.e. more opioids), causing a viscous cycle.</p>

<p>While Kratom helped me got off harder addictions, I’m starting to realize I lost a lot of my life to it also, even if I was functioning on it (which made it easy to convince myself it was ok)</p>

<p>And maybe Kratom is ok if you’re ok with mediocrity, or if you have chronic pain and need it.  </p>

<p>I still believe it should be legal, but it’s not as harmless as people believe… losing your ambition is a big price to pay , and the years can just pass you by. </p>

<p>Even with my dosage cut In half I find it easier to push myself into discomfort.  It’s invigorating now,  Sitting around isn’t so comfortable any more.  I get mad at myself</p>

<p>Something about pushing through discomfort can feel really good, much better than constant comfort.  </p>

<p>Besides we can still get comfort at the end of the day when we sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right. Kratom could be helpful for a while, but at the end of the day like you said  where there’ll come a time you have to choose between mediocrity, comfort, and feeling just “okay” or growing as a person and wanting more for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,
As the others said, Agmatine can be a great help to taper.</p>

<p>You may also take something like a good multivitamin. It seems stupid to mention something so mundane, but while getting clean, your appetite may be a bit upset and it&#39;s important to maintain a general healthy state.</p>

<p>Things which raise BDNF like Semax or something more potent like Cerebrolysin are a great help, but should be used at the right time:</p>

<p>Semax/Na-Semax or more potent peptides (Cerebro, Cortexin) raise BDNF, improve neuroplsticity and help brain repair.
It helps, among other things, to build new habits, new routines...so be sure to use them when you feel quite stable to build -good-  routines!</p>

<p>On another level, if you can, go to the gym (or any sport you like) if you don&#39;&#39;t now, go hiking if you can.
You need to make a clear &quot;cut&quot; with the routine when you used to be addict.</p>

<p>I never been severely addict to anything (a bit to Benzos many years ago) except to Nicotine (I don&#39;t smoke anymore but I still vape) but I know many people who used to be.</p>

<p>Ps: if you feel anxious while getting off this sh*t,  you may use some anti-anxiety herbs (Rhodiola Rosea in the day, Valerian and Hawthorn in the evening) or a mild calming non addictive compound like Selank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agmatine is helpful but personally I’m on the ass end of a kratom taper right now going from upwards of an ounce daily at peak but on it for five years. And it’s honestly just taken some patience and discomfort. I personally wouldn’t switch to a synthetic drug. 
My taper routine is to cut dose in half and try and make it four hours before redose but I’ve found that a redose at even two hours eventually over a couple to a few days I can make it to four hours with minimal discomfort.  And I’ve basically been doing that till I’m on about 2-3 grams if not maybe less and am working on dose spacing I’m passed physical discomfort and really down to no diarrhea but overactive bowels.</p>

<p>It’s taken commitment, patience, and most importantly not being hard on myself for not being able to stick to the routine. Just be patient with yourself and if you slip don’t get down and say I can’t do this might as well get just get high. Just say it’s all good and try and get back to it.
And agmatine has helped with the restless legs muscle discomfort.</p>

<p>That’s my personal experience and if I suggested any of it as advice please take it as experience or opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a myriad of reasons I won&#39;t use loperamide, one of them being it doesn&#39;t help me anymore. That, and the heart issues it causes ontop of the stool impaction issues, the shit can kill you. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also thought about trying to go to a suboxone/methadone clinic, but like you said, idk if I use enough, or if they&#39;d even treat me because it&#39;s mostly kratom. I think suboxone would do me some good, or maybe even sublocade, that buprenorphine injection that lasts like 3 months. But unfortunately I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be given either because my issue is kratom for the most part and it&#39;s weaker than buprenorphine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not dangerous in the sense that it&#39;s not lethal like benzodiazepine WDs are, but iirc opioid withdrawal can kill dopaminergic neurons and increase risks associated with that. The WDs themselves are neurotoxic to an extent.</p>

<p>Thank you tho! I appreciate the advice and the kind words! I&#39;ll get through it one way or another, might be tough, but I got this lol. Just waiting for my pregabalin, clonidine, and baclofen to arrive so I can ease the CT WDs as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen. I get it. Don’t apologize. I hung out on the quitting Kratom sub to get a lot of info and read all sorts of things. Luckily I happened to be in a country where I could go in and get Pregab and Clonodine without a script. I had a serious lockdown game plan while planning for the worst and it was total overkill. The second day I was hanging out with in laws and walking several miles in the country side. </p>

<p>I think I started with 150 mg of Pregab the first night thinking I’d need it for sleep….and that was a little high. I was pretty groggy the next day. Napped a few times. Only took clonodine at night I think. .10 mg. I think then I went to 75mg late morning and 75 mg evening with Pregab. Slept hard. I personally had zero RLS. I think bowels were messed up for a day max and nothing like coming off hard opiates. By day 3-4 I was back to total normal activities and my mood was fine. No freak out anxiety or depression. </p>

<p>Oh and on top of it I had some type of gnarly flu or cold. Tested neg for covid but the timing sucked. Pm me if you have other questions. Seriously no bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>.1 clonodine 3x a day. Sometimes I&#39;d take. 2 at once. Takes away shaking and helps with cold sweats. </p>

<p>I also took 900mg gabapentin 3x a day </p>

<p>Seroquel 25 to 100mg for sleep.</p>

<p>Apagenin 50mg, magnesium glycinate 400mg for sleep and ashwaganda for stress although I&#39;m not sure if this will put a dent in kratom wd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have issues with NMDA antagonists and opioids, oddly. It makes opioids have no effect for me I have no clue why. Last time I tried using memantine to help with my Kratom tolerance and it did the exact opposite. I had to take like 30 grams at once for like 4 days after taking just 5mg of memantine. The same is true for dxm, I am not sure about agmatine as I haven&#39;t taken agmatine since well before I got hooked on krato.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m at 8 years off of opiates. I was addicted to opiates for 12 years. I was addicted to heroin for the last five of my addiction. Go into a detox center. It&#39;s the only way they can give you meds that help curve it. Or go see your doctor and get Suboxone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll give me anything because I only use kratom. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve bought pregabalin, clonidine, and an MAOi but the MAOi is just for my depression but I bet it&#39;ll help to get me through the WDs too. Oh and baclofen but I probably won&#39;t use that while I&#39;m quitting, don&#39;t want to get addicted to that too.
There&#39;s studies showing pregabalin and clonidine are good for opioid WDs so I think I&#39;ll be okay. Thank you for the advice though, I&#39;ve thought about going to rehab for a long time now but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;d be taken seriously at all because anything they will give me is going to be stronger than kratom. People use kratom as an alternative to suboxone and stuff, it&#39;s far weaker even tho it is still a partial agonist like buprenorphine. </p>

<p>Also, happy cake day!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn I&#39;m sorry to hear that, that&#39;s kinda where I&#39;m at with it too. I dont think my entire life is destroyed just yet, but that is definitely the path I&#39;m headed on if I don&#39;t stop soon</p>
