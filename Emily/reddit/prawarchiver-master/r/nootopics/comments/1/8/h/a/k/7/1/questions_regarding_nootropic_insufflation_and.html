        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve recently been getting more and more interested in nootropics and i&#39;ve ordered a few myself, particularly the racetams, however insufflation/nasal sprays, especially nasal sprays, spark my curiosity. I&#39;ve got a few questions about them, and i&#39;d love to hear people&#39;s experiences with insufflation/nasal sprays if you guys have any</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it irritating long-term to the mucous membranes? What about nasal sprays, same thing? Is it fine to take occasionally in that case or best to avoid it entirely?</li>
<li>How effective/fast is this method of administration?</li>
<li>How much would i need to decrease the dosage from oral/sublingual, roughly? (I know this can depend significantly since each substance is different, but is there any sort of estimate i can go off of like &quot;x times less weight&quot;?)</li>
<li>Not really related to insufflation but: What are some other effective fast methods of administration that have worked very well (or just as well) for you, if you&#39;ve got any experience with them? (Note: personally sublingual hasnt worked too well, or fast, at all)</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) it&#39;s been my experience that long term nasal spray use hasn&#39;t had any lasting effects on my sinuses. For the record I use noopept with a PG base and Bromantane with a caprylic acid base. Haven&#39;t been into snorting raw powder. </p>

<p>2) 5 ish minutes compared to the 20-30 for oral route. However, that being said, I&#39;ve absolutely experienced different effects from different routes. It might have something to do with the way it&#39;s metabolized? I dunno, not a Dr. Noopept works better for me IN via spray, but Bromantane works better for me orally. Also, oral seems to last longer too. Again, couldn&#39;t tell you why. </p>

<p>3) I honestly don&#39;t think there&#39;s a cheat code for this one. It all depends on bioavailability. Typical oral noopept dose is 10-30mg, and IN dose is 1-10mg. Whereas typical bromantane oral dose is 50-100mg, and IN is 9-18mg. The basic rule of thumb is if it CAN be done, it HAS been done, and someone out on the interwebs will have the information you need. </p>

<p>3a) Another thing to consider when taking noots IN is that you can&#39;t just snort anything and have it work. This is something I only understand at like the MOST basic level, but it depends on the molecular weight of the noot. Anything under 1000 Dalton (I guess that&#39;s the unit of measurment?) SHOULD work IN, but anything over is too big to get through the mucus membrane. Bromantane is like 306 and some change, so it works just fine, but tirzepatide (not that it&#39;s a noot, just for an example) is like 4800, which is too big, so you&#39;re just &quot;swallowing it&quot; with your nose at that point. </p>

<p>3b) one last thing. If nasal spray is your preferred method, you have to know what your noots are soluble in. Noopept isn&#39;t great in water, but will dissolve in PG with a little heat. Bromantane needs a lipid to go into solution, so PG won&#39;t work worth a shit (ask me how I found out)</p>

<p>4) there are some peptide based noots like selank and semax that can be administered subq, but I haven&#39;t gotten into that. And at that point you gotta worry about things like sterility. Probably shouldn&#39;t just blast a bump of phylpiracetam that you just pulled out of your little jar.</p>
