    <div class="md"><p>Itâ€™s hard to give general recommendations because of the immense heterogeneity in the human population.  One person takes stimulants and their iq goes up 10 points while another takes the same and their iq goes down 10 points. 
Another level of complexity is added by the measure of intelligence. IQ is actually quite limited. A measure of fluid intelligence such as G factor would encompass more breadth and therefore be a better way to quantify relative changes from certain habits or substances.
The best way to find out what works for you is to take tests apply protocols / behaviours / substances to see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. Human variability  make it challenging to provide universal recommendations. Personalized experimentation and observation seem to be key in understanding what works best for each person&#39;s cognitive performance, although time consuming. I would still like to know about others opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stimulants will increase IQ for everyone, and guide often then ones action where this IQ is utilized into stereotypical and obsessive intelligence patterns, which then turn increased IQ useless. </p>

<p>Bit like one previous friend who used speed when he had to clean the house, but then found himself spending half an hour wiping some single dirty cup into clean one. Similar pattern can occur in more complex intellectual actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something as simple as Creatine is measured to increase IQ in aged people. And it hints out, that other mitochondrial enhancers then ought to work into this direction, as brain cells are most energy-intensive ones. There is though great difference here in old-age and young-age people groups responses. </p>

<p>Modafinil increases IQ - but not in high IQ people, but in low IQ people only. So unlikely its categorization as &#39;smart drug&#39; it is actually &#39;stupid drug&#39; or drug meant for such people only as smart people can freely skip it and its potentially problematic side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To enhance cognitive abilities and intelligence, various methods can be employed. Meditation improves focus and reduces stress, contributing to better brain function. N-Back Training targets working memory, potentially boosting fluid intelligence. Binaural beats, though with mixed scientific backing, are believed to aid concentration. Nootropics like 4DMA-7,8-DHF, Noopept, and Bacopa Monnieri are popular for their purported cognitive-enhancing effects, though they should be used with caution. Regular physical exercise benefits not just the body but also cognitive function and memory. Engaging in activities that challenge logic and reasoning skills sharpens the mind and improves problem-solving abilities. Alongside these methods, ensuring adequate sleep, a healthy diet, and social interactions are crucial for maintaining and enhancing brain health and cognitive abilities.</p>
