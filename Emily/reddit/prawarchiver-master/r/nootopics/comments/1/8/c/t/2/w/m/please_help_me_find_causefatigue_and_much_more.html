        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>26Male
On 18mg buprenorphine and 40mg vyvanse</p>

<p>Symptoms: Extreme fatigue, anhedonia, constant stressed/tense, mild to severe anxiety and lots of weird other symptoms. 
I listed all of them below at the end of the post.</p>

<p>Diagnoses by doctor:
ADHD(non hyperactive) 
General anxiety disorder
Atypical depression
Body dysmorphia bdd
Probably autism, but not that severe, doing the test now with my psychologist and she thinks so.</p>

<p>Clean addict, however, all symptoms except the visual disturbance were present before i started using in the first place. Some has got worse though. 
Also these symptoms are the reason i started self medicating.</p>

<p>What i have tried:
Tried almost every type of recreational drugs, most symptoms improve drastically on amphetamine and methylphenidate. Even the inflammation-like symptoms. </p>

<p>50+ nootropics both common ones and obscure like semax and selank.
Tried all the standard antidepressant classes except MAOIs. And many neuroleptics in low doses to try to upregulate dopamine receptors.  No help except that anxiety might have improved on them.</p>

<p>I listed my symptoms below and i would really appreciate any ideas on both possible causes to test for and theories on why only the stims .
I really want to quit them and find a non-rewarding drug to help me without the triggering of my past drug use and to feel ok for more than 3 hours/day and at the cost of worsening symptoms in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Here are my symptoms:</p>

<p>urination and difficulty emptying the bladder. Urgency to urinate. Leaking drops when sitting down or standing up. </p>

<p>Constant fatigue; I can only perform non-cognitive tasks at best, and at worst, I struggle to brush my teeth, delay bathroom visits, and experience brain fog regardless of my current mental state. </p>

<p>Pain in the neck and ankles, sometimes in the feet (underside), wrists, and fingers, especially when playing the guitar etc</p>

<p>Burning sensation under the foreskin when washing, requiring twice-daily washing to prevent inflammation and a foul smell. </p>

<p>Burning and tingling sensation on the skin of the face in the morning, with swelling, especially in the eyelids. </p>

<p>Urine smells bad and is occasionally foamy, but the foaming has improved. </p>

<p>Overly tense and highly sensitive to stress and stimuli, to the point of avoiding phone calls entirely at times. </p>

<p>Very stiff joints, unable to sit on heels, worst  in the upper back. </p>

<p>Tingling in legs and forearms, like RLS accompanied by a heavy feeling, less intense now but constant. </p>

<p>Trembling often when sitting or going down stairs. </p>

<p>Symptoms almost disappear when running but return afterward, usually worsening then. </p>

<p>Itchy rashes, eczema, dandruff, acne (less acne when other symptoms are better). </p>

<p>Fluid has come out of the nipples a few times, accompanied by itching. </p>

<p>Occasional chills, freezing especially in the morning, and sweats with an overheated feeling, usually in the evenings. Full feeling in the ears that decreases when turning the head, with a clicking sensation.</p>

<p>Many symptoms improve during fasting. Worse with adaptogens, I believe. 
 with stimulants, but worse in the evenings. Mild visual disturbances; things &quot;breathing,&quot; but unnoticed unless focused on. Temporary loss of sensation in feet and fingers, usually in parts of a finger, a 1-2 cm area. Extreme sweating, especially in the face, when warm. Heart palpitations even without anxiety, occurring intermittently.</p>

<p>Sry for the wall of text, and thank you so much for your time!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, i have been to a doctor now and my thyroid hormones are fine, tsh 1 and free t4 21, testosterone is kind of low within normal range though and bioactive t was normal. I have been on t once before on my own in high doses and felt no improvement so i kind of doubt its that.</p>

<p>Crp and sr was low also, but i feel like i have a huge inflammation everywhere.. Doing keto since 3w hoping it could starve mold/candida if its that. Pain has lowered a little from ketosis so far, but not the fatigue or the other symptoms. Cervical issues also on my to check list</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am prescribed 70mg vyvanse, 10mg dexadrine, 50mg prozac, tirzepatide, and 8mg or less suboxone, a day. I have realized and will talk to my dr, but vyvanse has started making me really sleepy. The dex works so much better. Also, that is what I am prescribed. I also buy adderall from friends and take a bunch a day because I&#39;m soooo tired all of the time. But what has helped tremendously is that I started researching peptides and nootropics. I also had a hormone test and showed that they are all very low, which explains why I&#39;m tired. </p>

<p>2 months ago I tried Noopept and for the first time in 3 years I noticed that was happy to be outside.  Because for 3 years I have wanted nothing but to be in bed all day and night every day. However, I also had not taken any stimulants in 2 weeks and that day was when I started back on a low dose. I&#39;ve never felt that euphoria from Noopept again but it&#39;s still helped me stay out of the 3 year depression that I didn&#39;t even realize I was in. </p>

<p>Here is my current stack.
All of the above plus
Noopept 1-4 times a week
Aniracetam 4-5 days a week
Mic B12 twice a week
Semax Nasal 
Ghk-cu nasal- 2-4 a week
Sabroxy 1-6 times a week 
Acetyl L carnitine 1 per day
Oxiracetam-ehh just whenever I have not felt anything from it but I just keep trying lol
Acetyl L-tyrosine 1 a day
Methylfolate 1 a day
Pregnanolone 1 per day</p>

<p>These I have been taken for about 2 years and they helped me during my time of the month. 
Magnesium bisglycinate every night
Magnesium glycinate at Night
Magnesium citrate at night
Sometimes Magnesium threonate- after taking I wake up in the morning and feel like I  finally breathed through the night.  Not meaning like I was congested and it helped clear it. I mean like a weight was finally lifted off of me at night while I slept. And I didn&#39;t have that pressure in my lungs that apparently I didn&#39;t realize had been there before lol
Tumeric at night
Vitamin C at night</p>

<p>I have tried mots-c, AOD, epitalon, Oxytocin, Ipamorelin, cortagen. 
I was taking cortagen when I took the Noopept that day too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m have Cerebrolysin and cortexin that I&#39;m waiting to start and try. 
And I also and about to try dL-phenylalanine. </p>

<p>Other things I&#39;ll be trying out
Agmatine
L-glutathione </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what is working and what&#39;s not so I just keep on taking it because I feel like myself again for the first time in 3 years</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was insanely tired when I was on Suboxone - It was a battle to get up every morning (well it would usually end up being afternoon by the time I got up) some days I literally got up to eat and then I&#39;d go back to bed and just sleep. Since going off it, I&#39;m now waking up at 8 am whether I like it or not...I didn&#39;t realize it was a Suboxone symptom until I got off, I just thought I wasn&#39;t a morning person! (Was on for 14 years)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your age, the visual disturbances, and the anhedonia would make me at least wonder about a possible psychotic disorder in an early (prodromal) stage.  Men who go on to develop a psychotic disorder (such as schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, etc) often begin to get symptoms of psychosis (such as visual disturbances) in early 20s and they may worsen until they result in a psychotic break.  Anhedonia can be part of the clinical picture.  (You also mentioned the visual disturbances worsening).  The smells you mention may in fact be real smellsâ€”or they could be partly imagined or exaggerated by your mind.  Psychotic disorders involve dysfunction in the dopamine system so this may be why dopaminergic meds like stimulants are particularly effective, at least for the anhedonia.  Do they make the visual disturbances worse, I wonder?  Stimulants can worsen psychotic symptoms, so be careful with them!</p>

<p>Im not a doctor, and what Iâ€™m saying doesnâ€™t obviously explain your physical symptoms, but Iâ€™d make sure my medical providers and psychologist knew about these visual symptoms youâ€™re describing. Iâ€™m sure your psychologist has also done a family history to see if youâ€™re at a heightened risk for schizophrenia etc.</p>

<p>On the other handâ€”the mild hallucinations you describe donâ€™t always have anything to do with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, etc.  Something like 10 percent of the population has occasional hallucinations as part of their everyday experience, so itâ€™s not always pathological!  But I would keep the possibility of a developing mental health disorder on my radar!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for your time and help! I dont think thats it because its only the visual thing(very mild only see it when i try to detect it) i think it might be brain damage or some other consequence of my past drug use. I dont feel psychotic ever except on high doses of amphetamine when i used to do that. Even then i usually get that its just in my head. Maybe however could be bipolar.</p>

<p>But im leaning more towards chronic fatigue syndrome, mold/other toxin, cervical issues or some other similar condition which makes me feel depressed because i feel sick all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for your time! I have done some blood work now and will soon meet the doctor again for follow up. could it still be that when my crp and sr came back low? </p>

<p>Im thinking could it be me/cfs? Mold/candida/other toxin? Cervical issues(neck pain is constant and stiff muscles but its like part of the pain is deeper than the muscles are, like its inside the spine)</p>

<p>Other things i have in the back of my head is lupus, Epstein barr, cancer, cushings syndrome, addisons, etc.. </p>

<p>, i have been to a doctor now and my thyroid hormones are fine, tsh 1 and free t4 21, testosterone is kind of low within normal range though and bioactive t was normal. I have been on t once before on my own in high doses and felt no improvement so i kind of doubt its that.</p>
