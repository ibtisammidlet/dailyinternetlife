<p>I&#39;m doing a computer programming course in the C language. I code all day long, and it&#39;s very tiring! I work out, I eat healthy, I take cold showers, I sleep early and that&#39;s the best nootropics I know, there are no magic pills like in the movie limitless. I&#39;ve tried bromantane, phenylpiracetam and nicotine gum. I really liked bromantane and phenylpiracetam, but I have the impression that tolerance builds up quickly, especially with phenylpiracetam. I even hesitate to try 2 FMA which is not a nootropic 2 times a week, and even take ritalin which is not a nootropic either. If you have any suggestions that would be cool!
I was advised to take fladrafinil, which was the same as vyvanse but apparently stronger. </p>

<p>Have a great day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same kind of...situation. </p>

<p>I sometimes have very long days of work. I am a teacher, i get up at 5.30, some days i work until 9PM to create or update my course and teaching hours in high school are very demanding. </p>

<p>My week if often 60hours of work per week (18 hours teaching, about 40 hours of personal work) The fact that i have beta-thalassemia (minor, fortunately) does not help.</p>

<p>You seem reasonable and understand that there is no absolute magic pill, especially with stimulants, so we can talk efficiently. First, we are talking about compounds for their stimulating and eugeroic actions. Some of them are nootropics, some are not.</p>

<p>-Phenylpiracetam is quite potent...but its half life is short and there is a crash (after about 4 hours for me). Tolerance builds fast. Ok to give you a boost for some hours, but it won&#39;t do the trick for a full day.</p>

<p>-Caffeine...well, it&#39;s cheap, it works, it&#39;s a real help but until a certain point: tolerance is real (but manageable), there is a crash and, although it gives energy, it&#39;s not extremely efficient to keep you awake. </p>

<p>-Dynamine: Well...it works quickly but has a very short half life, i prefer caffeine. Ok for a pre-workout, maybe or associated to caffeine to give you a kick.</p>

<p>➔ The Dynamax pills from Nootropics Depot are quite good, because they contain Dynamine, Caffeine and delayed release caffeine. It&#39;s associated bit some Theanine to smooth it up: it&#39;s smoother and longer lasting than plain caffeine.</p>

<p>-Theacrine: I had some hopes (loooong half life, separate tolerance from caffeine), but it&#39;s mild, very mild. By itself, it&#39;s worthless for me. It potentiates caffeine, though.</p>

<p>-Bromantane: Not a stimulant (or very mild) or an eugeroic in itself but this compound is very very interesting. It won&#39;t boost you, but it delays fatigue and you recover quicker.</p>

<p>-Modafinil/Armodafinil and all other -afinils: Ok, it works. It works great. Armodafinil even works for a full day. Modafinil and Armodafinil have a very positive effect on my mood. But classic -afinils (i dont&#39;k know about the fl- versions) need a prescription. There is not a huge tolerance (and tolerance fades quite quickly) but it has to be taken with some care and responsibly. (Adrafinil is a prodrug and hard on the liver. Avoid it)</p>

<p>-Never tried any harder stims like Adderall and i&#39;ll never do.</p>

<p>-I get some good results with 4-DMA 7&#39;8-DHF (TrkB agonist)...not a stimulant but it seems to a slight eugeroic effect and it can help to focus better when you are tired. Its half life is *extremely* long, so if you don&#39;t take it very early, it will mess up your sleep.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear: use of stimulants should be very casual and you should not combine them if you don&#39;t know what you are doing. (Sorry to insist on this aspect, but you never know who is the guy who is reading you. I work with teenagers and they often do stupid things.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting...
I&#39;ve read very mixed things about Sabroxy
Some people mention a stimulating effect, others feel some fatigue (as it would be, among other things, an A2A Agonist)...and some people (like Sirsadalot) consider it like a placebo because of a very low bioavailability.</p>

<p>I have no opinion...I may try it one day.
I would like to read some studies about it, especially about bioavailability of Sabroxy (we already know the effect of pure Orexin A but we don&#39;t know much about this form)</p>

In any case, your explanations are precise and detailed, thank you very much! I may try modafinil and armodafinil, but not every day by doing my own research. The same goes for 4-DMA 7&#39;8-DHF.

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! Most of the people on this sub are quite knowledgeable and cautious, but we never know!</p>

<p>4-DMA (you can find it a Nootropics Depot) is well tolerated for most people. It seems safe but there are very few studies about it, it has to be said.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best taken sublingually (just open the pill and pour it under your tongue). 
It works very well for many people, some people seem non-responders, I don&#39;t know why.
If you take it for more than some days, you may take some Polygala (2*100mg a day) to avoid any risk of TrkB downregulation. (Not a big concern)
Polygala feels stimulating to some people, sedating for others. It sedates me, so i take some in the evening.</p>

<p>Modafinil and Armodafinil are well studied. You&#39;ll find all the informations without any problem. </p>

<p>No problem at all with your English for me, it&#39;s better than mine! (it&#39;s not my first language either)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I was very reluctant to take any. At most it would have been once a week, but that can quickly turn into a disaster if I like it too much and start taking it regularly. I&#39;ll stick to classic nootropics like bromantane, phenylpiracetam... And maybe try ritalin. Thanks for the advice, You may have saved me lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ritalin is the only ‘big’ stimulant I’d say is okay for productivity long term. I’ve read 100s of studies on adhd medication, Ritalins effects on downregulating dopamine seem to last ~1 week. So you can use it frequently and if you take 3-4 weeks off every 4-5 months or so and you will be absolutely fine. </p>

<p>Every other type of med that involves amph or methamph, it downregulates dopamine for many MANY months. Trust me, I know, it’s terrible. Ritalin is great :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ritalin is probably the best, but not sure what you’re basing the 1 week on. Looking in terms of c-fos/fos b in the midbrain not even caffeines effect will be back to prior to use in a week, seriously doubt receptor densities and sensitivity would bounce back that quickly either, again even with caffeine as the example. </p>

<p>Maybe if you’re considering a single dose/week recovery…but even then idk. Also in terms of net productivity that’s pretty much pointless, unless Ritalin makes you really creative or something (lol).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would link you the study I found comparing long acting lisdexamfetamine and methylphenidate HCL, they found that lisdex had a much more prominent effect at downregulating dopamine for a very long time, but ritalins down regulation only lasted a week. It does make sense since Ritalin is a reuptake inhibitor only, yet amphs are a release and reuptake duo. Ritalin is substantially less neurotoxic in this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm (anecdotally) a week long break from Methylphenidate made no difference on my tolerance, or baseline mood.</p>

<p>Only thing is my first dose after the break hit <em>slightly</em> harder, and by my second dose tolerance was right back to where it was.</p>

<p>Currently trying to go 3-4 weeks without Methylphenidate, while supplementing 30 mg sublingual 9-me-bc every day.</p>

<p>The 9-me-bc appeared to slightly improve my baseline after about 8 days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t know where you sourced that, but I wouldn’t touch it. </p>

<p>If it doesn’t have a major effect on you (assuming you are stim tolerant) at doses lower than that, I seriously doubt the validity of the product. The MAOI effect alone felt should be strong virtually immediately.</p>

<p>I felt much stronger effects immediately at doses less than half of that, after being off almost all stims for about half a year. </p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is the MAOI effect isn’t as perceptible to you because you’re still in acute withdrawal, especially via NE regulation which should bounce back much faster, but acutely you might be blunted more…idk…I just really have my doubts about a lot of these suppliers in terms of identity at this point based on my experience compared to others. Let alone purity given the insane toxicity of <em>very</em> similar compounds likely to be present in less than perfect batches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree it’s risky, but I was desperate.  </p>

<p>That makes sense about not feeling it immediately because I was in acute withdrawal.  I’m feeling significantly better now 3 weeks into the cycle.</p>

<p>Not only were my stimulants barely working, but my Kratom addiction spiraled out of control, crushing my testosterone.  I could barely get out of bed, blunted like you said.  Basic tasks felt difficult and painful.</p>

<p>My life is good too, I shouldn’t be depressed.</p>

<p>Do you think my mood is so much better because of the MAOI?  Or is it dopamine repair / up regulation?  </p>

<p>On day 8 I cut my Kratom use in half, almost effortlessly…. Previously even just a small cut was a huge struggle.  My Kratom use is rapidly dropping even more, and my dead libido came raging back.  Hopefully that’s a sign testosterone is coming back .</p>

<p>I never tried a lower dose of 9-me-bc, I just started at the max.  I felt terrible, needed to feel better urgently.</p>

<p>I sourced from Chemyo and Science.bio….youre right about the potential for bad synthesis.  I’m sticking with science.bio for the future….theirs actually burns much less too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great timing with this comment, you’re really encouraging me to stick with my tolerance break.</p>

<p>Currently on week 2 of no DexMethylphenidate, and my life is slowly falling apart.  I’m trying to go 3-4 weeks, which is funny cuz that’s the same number you mentioned.</p>

<p>I almost gave up today, but I’ll try to go another week (or hopefully two.). I figured it might be pointless, as prior month long breaks from Amphetamine did very little.</p>

<p>Also on a 9-me-bc cycle to help restore dopamine tone, and reduce damage….maybe even reverse some tolerance too.</p>

<p>The 9-me-bc seems to be reducing the anhedonia and negativity I experience when I go off my meds.</p>

<p>To add to my self inflicted suffering I cut my Kratom use by over half…,although the 9-me-bc seems to be helping me push through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afinils aren’t comparable to amphs in the way you seem to compare them. They’re both stimulants, and stronger than caffeine. The comparison should end there. </p>

<p>Don’t mean to be disrespectful, but imo you’re getting relatively exotic for your experience level. Have you tried things like CDP choline/Alcar? Both are dopamine sensitizers. Quitting porn is too. </p>

<p>Afinils especially considering the half lives have the potential to interact the second day in major ways with ritalin and/or any other stims you might wind up taking. Just be careful is all, and I certainly wouldn’t try things with little human evidence until you exhaust the basic things like making sure you’re nutritionally well rounded. (500mg-1g vitamin C/day, Zinc, vitamin d sufficient (50-70-ish), magnesium sufficient, retinol intake at RDA, prob want an active b complex, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was meaning against fl/adrifinil. Just because of their pro drugs. I wouldn’t be very concerned about legality but finding a legitimate source is tough I think I saw one that wasn’t an online pharmacy like a year ago but it was overseas.
Flmodafinil would just be so much more convenient and from what I’ve read would be as effective.</p>

It&#39;s mild compared to Phenylpiracetam but can be taken quite often.
And it&#39;s cheap.
It helps to focus and to think clearly but I don&#39;t think it can be considered as a stimulant.
It&#39;s not a stil, but it helps to work on complex problems.</p>

<p>I used it a lot, I sometimes still do (especially for complex tasks). But for focusing on complex tasks, Tak-653 (from Everychem.com) is even better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve never heard of 2-fma but Ritalin is not going to be any safer than amphetamine or any other stimulant med, the abuse potential is the same, and even if you take it as prescribed, it will very quickly be a case of diminishing returns, it will cease to be effective and you’ll just be taking it to feel normal (what your new normal is, which will be no better than how you are now, probably worse) and prevent withdrawals. Then you’ll realise it sucks eventually and have to stop taking it and you’ll suffer weeks/months of anhedonia and lethargy as your brain tries to return to normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ritalin or Adderall should only be used for medical conditions, when every other thing has failed. But it&#39;s just my opinion, I won&#39;t tell anyone what to do.</p>

<p>Be aware that Ritalin has far more side effects than Modafinil or Armodafinil. And it&#39;s possible to find  -afinils online easily (i won&#39;t mention any source for Modafinil and Armodafinil,  they are prescription drugs, but it&#39;s very easy.)...not so much for Ritalin, I think.</p>

<p>There is some neurotoxicity with Ritalin (less than with Adderall, I think) and it can cause dependence. -afinils are much safer in this aspect.</p>

<p>Note: I don&#39;t know where you live, Ritalin is legal in Europe as a treatment for ADHD if prescribed. But Adderall is not even legal in many parts of Europe.
Ritalin remains much safer than Adderall, which is sh*t in my opinion. I know you did not talk about Adderall but as they are often compared...</p>

Neither are noo-tropics but just clean amphetamines/stimulants.
