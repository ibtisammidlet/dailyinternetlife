        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi! What can you do with noradrenaline hypersensitivity? When i take dopaminergic substances like mucuna or wellbutrin i get really anxious and can&#39;t sleep, but when i take low dose antipsychotics which is increases specifically dopamine in the synapse i feel good. So... the main take away is that i want to enjoy dopaminergic substances without the noradrenaline effects. I also have c-ptsd so that could explain why I&#39;m sensitive to it.</p>

<p>Is it even possible to stop the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline to an extent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wellbutrin is mainly a NRI, not a dri. So it&#39;s first mechanism is increasing norepinephrine.
You haven&#39;t stated how much mucuna you take, or if you take it with food, which both make a very large difference.
You can&#39;t really dictate off 2 substances that this is specifically what you need, especially when 1 of them is well defined to do what you don&#39;t want to happen, </p>

<p>Given you said antipsychotics help you feel better, it would well show that you need less dopamine, and not more. Since antipsychotics work by reducing systemic dopamine activity (mainly on d2 type receptors), what makes you think you need more? </p>

<p>Excess dopamine will cause anxiety in anyone pending the pathway. Either via excess reduction in serotonin, or excess catabolism to norepinephrine.</p>

<p>To answer the end, the enzyme responsible for converting dopamine to norepinephrine is called dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), which uses copper and vitamin C as co-factors. And the enzyme responsible for converting norepinephrine to epinephrine is PNMT, utilizing methly groups for cofaftors. Trust me it&#39;s simpler and more easy to search if I leave it that vague about PNMT instead of typing it all out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree on the antipsychotic part. I take very low doses which is increasing dopamine. Since low doses block presynaptic d2 which manages the reuptake of dopamine so its net increase in dopamine until you take higher doses then its a full blockade</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, low dose of atypicals such as abilify or vraylar will increase dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex without lowering activity in the midbrain, at doses lower than what are prescribed by doctors. Such as under 2.5mg of Abilify. But this effect takes roughly 2 weeks given the time needed to desensitize D2s receptors. So any immediate effect you receive from them before that is due to reduction in dopamine activity. </p>

<p>But again, you have not provided any information as to which antipsychotic you have taken. Given even the atypicals have other mechanisms of action such as 5ht2a antagonism, 5ht1a agonism, a1 antagonism, h1 antagonism, etc.</p>

<p>Also, D2s receptors don&#39;t manage the reuptake as they are not transporters. They just signal to slow/reduce the release of dopamine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm that&#39;s weird. I take sulpiride 200 mg sporadically when I feel bad. And if I take it more than 2 days in a row then it&#39;s losing all efficacy. So I take it once a week. Why does this take two weeks? By this logic if I take more I should feel better but I&#39;m getting numbed by larger doses or more frequent doses</p>
