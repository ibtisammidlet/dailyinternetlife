        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The beneficial effects of nicotine on cognition are well documented, but it appears as though GTS-21 (DMXBA) is nicotine&#39;s successor, demonstrating more benefits than nicotine itself. This post will be investigating the potential of GTS-21, and what&#39;s to be learned from it.</p>

<h1>How it works:</h1>

<p>GTS-21 is a partial agonist of the α7 nicotinic receptors. This becomes neuroprotective when the receptor is overexpressed: it competes with stronger agonists, decreasing the potential for excitotoxicity (which is mediated by calcium influx). Thus, α7 nicotinic receptors show similarity to NMDA receptors in this capacity.</p>

<p>That being said, partial agonism (and likewise calcium influx) also comprise GTS-21&#39;s nootropic ability. A quote from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1300028">Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Effects on Cognitive Function of Multiple Doses of GTS-21 in Healthy, Male Volunteers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GTS-21 showed statistically significant enhancement of three measures of cognitive function (attention, working memory, episodic secondary memory) compared to placebo.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems as though the activation of α7 nicotinic receptors, when otherwise inactive, catalyzes a state of increased neuroplasticity, giving GTS-21 functionality as a nootropic.</p>

<p>Furthermore, α7 nicotinic receptors (and GTS-21) <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/10515327">are not responsible for the addictive effects of nicotine</a>, and GTS-21 <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00509509/document">is an even more potent anti-inflammatory than nicotine</a>.</p>

<h1>Recent interest in nicotinic receptors:</h1>

<p>Nicotinic receptors are glial-active and have reported nootropic effects in healthy people, similarly to D-Serine. Indeed they rely upon one another for long term potentiation, and can be enhanced concurrently. As noted in other studies, NMDA modulation in concert with cholinergic drugs is synergistic for cognitive decline, so perhaps the same is true for those seeking a nootropic effect.</p>

<p>In the context of Schizophrenia, it appears that GTS-21, unlike D-Serine, did not improve cognition. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3746983/">Source</a>. They did experience a reduction of negative symptoms when high doses of 150mg were used, however. Unfortunately these doses also caused nausea in half of the patients, so GTS-21 has little use in Schizophrenics.</p>

<p>That being said, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0685-0">tropisetron doesn&#39;t have this problem</a>. That is because it&#39;s a 5-HT3 antagonist, and because of this it has also been used in preventing nausea from chemotherapy. Based on that logic, GTS-21&#39;s pro-nausea symptoms may be attenuated by a ginger extract, as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16364290/">ginger disrupts the 5-HT3 receptor ion-channel complex</a>. Ginger also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/ryltfn/ginger_extract_taken_orally_by_mice_facilitates/">has a positive effect on LTP and learning</a> as well.</p>

<h1>More mysteries surrounding nicotinic receptors:</h1>

<p><strong>Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) upregulation by nicotine?</strong> Since it appears nicotine can enhance C-Fos, I believe the TH upregulation we see is a prolonged positive feedback with D1, since nicotine releases dopamine. That, or it could be that calcium influx itself does it by activating CaMKII, then adenylate cyclase, then generating cAMP through that pathway as described in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(19">this</a>49518-5/pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjZ-fKg0p31AhXrkYkEHa6UALoQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jTGzrPnQSL5sKXGcif-9b) paper. But the former sounds more likely to me.</p>

<p><strong>Nicotine upregulates itself?</strong> It is true that, upon binding, nicotinic receptors upregulate. However, this does not mean that nicotine is sensitizing in any capacity. Based on <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/31/8202">this source</a>, it appears the recreational capacity of nicotine starts and ends at the α4 nicotinic receptors, which get upregulated more specifically on GABAergic neurons as response, and that gradually begins to inhibit the release of dopamine with time. Whether or not this only applies to α4s is unclear to me, as it appears some acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as Galantamine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2274601/">actually having complete lack of tolerance</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19252271/">nicotinic receptor upregulation may be a benefit to consuming acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</a>. Likewise I&#39;m unsure if an α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist such as GTS-21 will develop tolerance. So far the data suggests... Yes, but not how you&#39;d expect. It appears the agonist stabilizes the receptor in a desensitized state somehow. I&#39;ll edit to elaborate further tomorrow: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/</a></p>

<p>...there is no evidence that nicotine has favorable effects on episodic memory, in contrast to the clear effects of GTS-21 on this function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just plain false. This study you quote is from 2002, so you&#39;re effectively ignoring 20 YEARS of data! Further, the study is one study of 14 males, and is therefore inadequate to make such a claim, even if it were true. Nevertheless, I&#39;ll bite.</p>

<p>&quot;...including motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. We found significant positive effects of nicotine or smoking on six domains: fine motor, alerting attention-accuracy and response time (RT), orienting attention-RT, short-term episodic memory-accuracy, and working memory-RT.&quot; (in humans) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-010-1848-1">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-010-1848-1</a></p>

<p>Note that episodic memory is an aspect of declarative memory, which is itself an aspect of long-term memory. It involves remembering events from your live as the occurred. They do show an improvement here, unlike the result you showed.</p>

<p>But in any case, I think episodic memory is the wrong focus for assessing nootropic potential. Dopaminergic stimulants like amphetamines routinely show no improvement in prior recall (declarative memory) (other than those formed while under its influence), but do show improvement in working memory, which is the active, fluid intelligence aspect that could actually facilitate performance on tasks, and is what things like ADHD are actually concerned with.</p>

<p>&quot;Nicotine... repeatedly improved accuracy and reduced omission errors and reaction times, leading to increases in numbers of reinforcers earned...&quot; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-002-1005-6">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-002-1005-6</a></p>

<p>&quot;Compared with placebo, nicotine treatment was associated with more rapid and accurate recognition of novel items.&quot; (in humans) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-008-1133-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-008-1133-8</a></p>

<p>Nicotine/tobacco <em>withdrawal</em> impairs episodic memory. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.2010.499395?journalCode=vgen20">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00221309.2010.499395?journalCode=vgen20</a></p>

<p>So I think this is not &quot;no evidence.&quot; As always, more research is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, α7 nicotinic receptors (and GTS-21) are not responsible for the addictive effects of nicotine, and GTS-21 is an even more potent anti-inflammatory than nicotine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, &quot;addicting&quot; (reinforcing) effects induced by subunits like alpha-4-beta-2 may actually be the effector of many of the cognitive boosting effects! These are Na+, among other, ligand-gated ion channels. They lead to the downstream release of dopamine and norepinephrine, among others. So, you may be sacrificing potential nootropic benefit here by omitting all but alpha 7 subunits, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing given the addictive potential. But it must be noted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent interest in nicotinic receptors:</p>

<p>Nicotinic receptors are glial-active and have reported nootropic effects in healthy people, similarly to D-Serine. Indeed they rely upon one another for long term potentiation, and can be enhanced concurrently.

They did experience a reduction of negative symptoms when high doses of 150mg were used, however. Unfortunately these doses also caused nausea in half of the patients, so GTS-21 has little use in Schizophrenics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Compared with placebo, nicotine treatment was associated with more rapid and accurate recognition of novel items. There was a trend for a treatment by diagnosis interaction, such that the effect of nicotine to reduce false alarms was stronger in the schizophrenia than the control group...
Because memory deficits are associated with functional impairment in schizophrenia and because impaired novelty detection has been linked to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, study of the effects of chronic nicotinic agonist treatment on novelty detection may be warranted.&quot;
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-008-1133-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-008-1133-8</a></p>

<p>So it&#39;s still worth further investigation. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379034/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379034/</a> describes the dose-dependency of alpha 7 nAChR agonists in improving cognition in schizophrenics. They highlight too large doses (inducing receptor desensitization) and the super short-half life of some ligands (GTS-21&#39;s is only 1.7 hrs!) as being culprits for the lack of efficacy from clinical trials so far. These results are extremely important, and can make-or-break drug efficacy. Lower doses and/or slower release mechanisms ought to be tried before making your conclusion.</p>

<p>Further, alpha 7 nicotinic receptors are a very specific target. It could be that these drugs actually do help, but that the effects of schizophrenia a la NMDAR hypofunction and D2 hyperfunction overwhelm any benefit that may have. Perhaps giving this drug to schizophrenics who are also on antipsychotics, or even with D-serine, could improve cognition in schizophrenics. They might even reduce negative side effects of and further improve the cognition enhancing aspects of antipsychotics in them.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You conveniently omit, from that same source:  &quot;In hippocampus, chronic exposure to nicotine also increases α4* fluorescence on glutamatergic axons of the medial perforant path. In hippocampal slices from chronically treated animals, acute exposure to nicotine during tetanic stimuli enhances induction of long-term potentiation in the medial perforant path, showing that the upregulated α4* receptors in this pathway are also functional.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, this doesn&#39;t even mention alpha 7, which was the main focus of nootropic benefit in this discussion. I think this is worth further investigation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not this only applies to α4s is unclear to me, as it appears some acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as Galantamine actually having complete lack of tolerance </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acetylcholinterase inhibitors <em>pale</em> in comparison to the ability to enhance cholinergic signaling versus direct ligands. For instance: they&#39;re not addicting, meaning alpha-4-beta-2 probably doesn&#39;t get activated nearly as much. And this would apply to alpha-7 as well. So it makes sense that they don&#39;t form tolerane. </p>

<p>As an aside, both of these could implicate lower nootropic ability vs. direct ligands, especially in healthy people. Alzheimer&#39;s patients, already in deficit, simply would be able to benefit from the more subtle boosts of AChEIs vs. direct agonists. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and nicotinic receptor upregulation may be a benefit to consuming acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Likewise I&#39;m unsure if an α7 nicotinic receptor partial agonist such as GTS-21 will develop tolerance. So far the data suggests... Perhaps not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study I linked above suggested that acute alpha-7 desensitization (tolerance) was actually the culprit for these drugs not passing clinical trials. But again, this effect may be tied to the doses used, and not the ligand itself. Will be interesting to see how this and new ligands pan out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello and thanks for taking the time to go through my post. Not many people do. I feel as though you paint me as someone manipulating the facts, but I genuinely did not know nicotine improved episodic memory or anything about alpha-7 agonist-prone desensitization until now. As such, I will be making edits to my post.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which alpha-7 agonist desensitization occurs in nicotine and GTS-21 is actually quite interesting, here it states it is due to prolonged inhibition by the agonist itself (still wrapping my head around it) by stabilizing the receptor in a desensitized state: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672872/</a></p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t look like your average tolerance, but it does point towards the existence of better agonists.</p>

<p>As for the rest of your response, I have my own critiques. I want to start off by saying that while it is a logical assumption to suggest catecholamines confer additional nootropic effects with nicotine, this isn&#39;t necessarily true. And nicotine being highly effective for ADHD aside, I still think its dopaminergic mechanisms are sloppy in practice.</p>

<p>Anyways, gonna take out my wrong statements and then elaborate tomorrow. I&#39;m about to pass out.</p>
