        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Update: I no longer think diOHBA is safe. Based on predictive software, it&#39;s showing relatively high toxicity. To an extent, so does GTS-21 when compared to other molecules. But diOHBA is worse.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFIv3qSI1BwsAslrVwsEy_xpZJYX3QAZusOYjGHQk0g/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFIv3qSI1BwsAslrVwsEy_xpZJYX3QAZusOYjGHQk0g/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>I think I finally found an experimental drug with some serious potential.</p>

<p>3-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)anabaseine (abbv. diOHBA) is a metabolite of GTS-21 but it has some really unique features.</p>

<p>First of all it appears the &quot;instatolerance&quot; phenomenon observed with nicotine agonists of the alpha-7 type can be attributed to a residual inhibition caused by the chemical structure of the drugs themselves. This is a natural negative feedback characteristic of acetylcholine. Believe it or not, it is not partial agonism causing this (which is neuroprotective), so technically you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>And keep in mind it is not prototypical tolerance that appears to ruin alpha-7 agonists, but desensitization. Given that diOHBA&#39;s desensitization is less than that of acetylcholine, it actually has reverse desensitization and will become more potent with repeated exposure.</p>

<p>This means you could reap the alpha-7 derived benefits of nicotine (potent improvements to learning/ memory, anti-inflammation, etc.) without addiction, tolerance, and it may even be a more nootropic compound in itself.</p>

<p>I believe we should, at some point in the future, prioritize a custom synthesis for this compound. I am not sure of the safety, but we might be able to run it through some prediction software or call a favor on someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://Science.bio">Science.bio</a> doesn&#39;t sell diOHBA. They sell GTS-21, and they still have some in stock. But diOHBA is yet to be experienced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now rethinking this I think it would need testing before human use.</p>

<p>In my view diOHBA leverages a new mechanism not before demonstrated to science (the same receptor but different activity - earlier agonists are likely to have vastly different effects).</p>

<p>Alpha 7 (among other nicotine receptors like alpha 4 beta 2) is responsible for the cognitive enhancing side effects of nicotine, but also it&#39;s angiogenesis promoting effect - consequently cancer cell migration and metastasis. It wouldn&#39;t be far out there to hypothesize a non-desensitizing alpha 7 agent would activate angiogenesis far more than nicotine or GTS21. Neurotoxicity potential also needs to be examined and all of this can be done in vitro - no need to risk animal&#39;s lives :)</p>

<p>Alpha 7 is expressed outside of the nervous system on endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Trapping this molecule in the brain (intranasal use if BBB penetration is poor, otherwise IDK) would go a long way to prevent side effects.</p>

<p>I doubt prediction software will predict safety accurately.</p>

<p>Unless you mean something very different from what I take you to mean, these already exist and are relatively well-known. Allosteric modulators in general can sometimes do this, but drugs with functional selectivity that actually have unusually different actions at a receptor are known. </p>

<p>They generally work via inducing a very different complex when bound to the receptor (than that produced by typical agonists or antagonists). This is similar in kind to how most allosteric modulators function, which bind to an a separate allosteric site on the receptor that then modulates the receptor&#39;s activity, typically by enhancing or blunting the action of an agonist or antagonist, or the overall action of the receptor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Likely true, since it at its most reliable, that software usually relies on known warning signs, like certain kinds of functional groups that tend to be toxic. </p>

<p>There are other, much more interesting stuff included in the analysis, but it&#39;s much less reliable. And it&#39;s very easy to miss unknown unknowns that bite you, whether software or human.</p>
