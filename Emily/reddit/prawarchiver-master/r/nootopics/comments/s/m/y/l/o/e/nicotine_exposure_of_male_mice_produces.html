    <div class="md"><p>Certainly a concerning study. It&#39;s worth noting that the doses of nicotine used were pretty damn high though. 200ug/ml water translates to 2mg/10ml, which is a dose large enough to produce significant effects in humans. I don&#39;t know how much mice drink but they must&#39;ve been fuckin buzzin&#39; man lmao.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure haha. Anecdotally it checks out for me, my parents are smokers and I have ADHD. Of course I was also diagnosed after I had developed a nicotine addiction of my own so who knows. Live and learn I guess.</p>

<p>Seriously though, nicotine is the only drug I regret ever trying. I don&#39;t even get bad withdrawals or anything, but the craving is so intense and persistent. I always end up picking the habit back up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the cognitive benefits of nicotine are very real which is the unfortunate part. Look into Tropisetron from teamtlr or GTS-21 from Science.bio for nicotinic benefits and pair it with Bromantane nasal spray and ALCAR for dopaminergic effects. It won&#39;t be as euphoric but the mental improvement should be there, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weird thing for me is, 80% of the time it&#39;s not even a great feeling. I&#39;m super sensitive to medium-high doses, it makes THC (my favorite drug and genuinely helpful to my physical and mental health) much more intense and unpredictable, and beyond the first dose every day I only consume more in pursuit of that amazing feeling of perfectly timing a dose of nic with my morning coffee and Adderall.</p>

<p>TLDR I just need to quit that shit already haha. Would the compounds you suggested help reduce cravings since they have similar molecular targets?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been taking 600mg/day for over a year, recently increased my dose to 600mg 2-3x/day and added glycine. Never noticed a reduction in cravings at once a day, maybe I should try abstaining for a few days now that I&#39;ve increased my dose and see if it helps. Thanks for the suggestions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are you dosing it? I got some liquid mixed up at a vape shop and I think the ratio is somewhere around one or two milligrams per drop. I drop it on a wrist vein and let it sit there until it&#39;s gone or rub my wrist together. Transdermal leads to a very sustained evenly distributed dose that last around 6 to 8 hours. Now you aren&#39;t going to experience much of a quote experience, but you also won&#39;t experience a come down or any kind of withdrawal. I say this from the perspective of someone who doesn&#39;t do it very often so I don&#39;t know what your dosing regularly or how you&#39;re doing it etc it may be you have withdrawals because this doesn&#39;t support your normal habit. When I compare it to what I was doing before which is chewing 4 mg nicotine gum sticks, it&#39;s certainly is easier going. It&#39;s a light and subtle no tropic effect that I enjoy without many bad sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do nicotine salt; it greatly eases my muscles and nerves when overworked and I have never felt any addiction. So are you just doing salt or are you smoking?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been doing it six.months and quit days at a time.  </p>

<p>Highly underrated drug imo but I can&#39;t say I enjoy it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a relief, because this study becomes irrelevant from such high doses. I love nicotine, its the best daily nootropic I have ever used in my life, and I suspect that I have ADHD given that coffee can make me sleepy sometimes. Nicotine just always works for me to operate at a higher cognitive level and really helps me with learning &amp; memorizing information fast, discipline, and productivity. Nothing I&#39;ve tried compares, even with continued use of phenylpiracetam makes me sleepy. But not nicotine.</p>

<p>FYI, I only use nicotine lozenges, and avoid the tobacco form because in that form it is more habit forming &amp; addictive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s totally irrelevant, as it&#39;s also measured over a short time span, so a lifetime of smoking might have similar effects or maybe not. Just another reason for me to adopt lol.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve switched to pouches now. Started with sub ohm vaping in college, switched to salt nic vapes and that&#39;s when it got bad. Vapes are dangerous to me because of the accessibility, refilling the brain with nicotine every 30 seconds for most waking hours of the day becomes a tough habit to kick. Oral dosing definitely is much less compulsive and addictive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I don&#39;t feel or notice any addiction to nicotine lozenges, although my usage does go up when I need to perform a cognitively demanding task. I prefer the mini lozenges.</p>

<p>Yup, injecting or vaporizing the drug is definitely a bad delivery system in terms of avoiding addiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it would translate to about 40 mg human dose. Which is not much, like two packs of ciggs. BTW the information for mouse drinking and eating habits, weights, etc, are all available online. When you adjust for weight always divide by 12 for mice and 6 for rats bcs their metabolisms are that much faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Use of tobacco products is injurious to health in men and women. However, tobacco use by pregnant women receives greater scrutiny because it can also compromise the health of future generations. More men smoke cigarettes than women. Yet the impact of nicotine use by men upon their descendants has not been as widely scrutinized. We exposed male C57BL/6 mice to nicotine (200 μg/mL in drinking water) for 12 wk and bred the mice with drug-naïve females to produce the F1 generation. Male and female F1 mice were bred with drug-naïve partners to produce the F2 generation. We analyzed spontaneous locomotor activity, working memory, attention, and reversal learning in male and female F1 and F2 mice. Both male and female F1 mice derived from the nicotine-exposed males showed significant increases in spontaneous locomotor activity and significant deficits in reversal learning. The male F1 mice also showed significant deficits in attention, brain monoamine content, and dopamine receptor mRNA expression. Examination of the F2 generation showed that male F2 mice derived from paternally nicotine-exposed female F1 mice had significant deficits in reversal learning. Analysis of epigenetic changes in the spermatozoa of the nicotine-exposed male founders (F0) showed significant changes in global DNA methylation and DNA methylation at promoter regions of the dopamine D2 receptor gene. Our findings show that nicotine exposure of male mice produces behavioral changes in multiple generations of descendants. Nicotine-induced changes in spermatozoal DNA methylation are a plausible mechanism for the transgenerational transmission of the phenotypes. These findings underscore the need to enlarge the current focus of research and public policy targeting nicotine exposure of pregnant mothers by a more equitable focus on nicotine exposure of the mother and the father.</p>

<p>Perhaps a monoamine oxidase inhibitor like Nardil paired with bromantane and low dose nicotine?</p>
