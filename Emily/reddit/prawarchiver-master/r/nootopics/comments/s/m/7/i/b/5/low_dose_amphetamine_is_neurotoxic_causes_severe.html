        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this post I hope to elaborate on the consequences of prescription amphetamine. There are studies showing net benefit after prolonged treatment, however some treatment is better than no treatment, so what I&#39;m about to expose is not mutually exclusive. Rather, this is to support the notion that alternative dopaminergics are more promising.</p>

<h1>Withdrawal and neurotoxicity</h1>

<p>Dopamine downregulation from amphetamine is not well studied in humans. Amphetamine abuse is studied, however. The only scientific account of stereotypical withdrawal happening at lower doses I could find in humans was <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.journalofsubstanceabusetreatment.com/article/S0740-5472(07">this.</a>00150-X/fulltext) Anecdotally we observe people suffering after discontinuing amphetamine, but as always scientific validation is necessary.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more telling are the primate studies. <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1124/jpet.105.087916">This</a> one is particularly interesting, a study in baboons using similar doses to those of prescription amphetamines. The result was a regional depletion of dopamine (30-47%) and neurotoxicity at dopaminergic axon terminals. While the significance of these effects compound with chronic use, it occurs even after a single dose and can last up to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC2670101/">2 years.</a></p>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1395233">fascinating resource</a> using rhesus monkeys demonstrated impaired locomotion even 20 months after withdrawal from chronic low dose amphetamine. This is consistent with lower dopamine, and in this study they extrapolate the aberrant behavior to suggest it even could represent a model of psychosis (i.e. like that of Schizophrenia). Since dopamine is a necessary factor in learning and memory, this also implies amphetamine withdrawal is devastating to neuroplasticity. While not in primates, this is evidenced by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25986696/">impaired BDNF</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27085203/">memory</a> in rats and is seemingly saved by NMDA antagonists.</p>

<p>Most likely this can be attributed to the elevated circulating glutamate and AMPA activation, which is also responsible for the antidepressant effects of these drugs.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>While natural malfunction of dopamine circuitry is destructive, choosing the right drug is necessary. Bromantane and ALCAR deserve more investigation for their ability to produce dopaminergic effects even after discontinuation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The concerning study in primates&quot;? I linked multiple from different authors, regardless of your preference. And unless you can prove that there&#39;s some relevant genetic difference between primates and humans in regards to dopamine related pathways, these sources are indeed valid. You then follow it up with a statement, seemingly with no elaboration to support your counter argument, which seems biased to say the least.</p>

<p>The low doses are notably high enough in these studies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you read the sources, you&#39;d realise that none of them extended this conclusion to humans. Why? They&#39;re studying the neurological and behavioural effects of amphetamines in animals. Variations in intraspecies drug response is substantial enough to deter any well-informed person from making strong assumptions that extend interspecies.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one claiming that these findings are explicitly relevant to the human brain; it&#39;s on you to provide evidence that these results can directly be extrapolated onto a different species instead of relying on inferences from nonhuman primates. </p>

<p>Even Ricaurte is prudent enough to acknowledge that it&#39;s not an open and shut case in humans:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>These results raise obvious concerns about clinical drug treatment of ADHD, although extrapolation to human populations may be premature until possible species differences in mechanism of action, developmental variables, or metabolism are determined. Ricaurte et al. (2005) noted there is no consistent evidence of dopaminergic neurotoxicity in patients with ADHD who have been treated with AMPH.</em>
— <strong><em>PMID 17606768</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The outcomes in nonhuman primates just aren&#39;t as damning as you seem to imagine. You&#39;re not going to be the one to solve this neverending debate by making implications from a couple of nonhuman primate studies in a short post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Long-term exposure to amphetamine throughout adolescence in non-human primates has been observed in three studies. The animals were given daily doses of amphetamine that caused blood plasma levels of amphetamine equivalent to or slightly greater than those observed in adolescent humans prescribed the drug. Two of these studies found no discernible adverse effect on their physiology, behavior, or dopamine system development,[1][2] while one observed long-term damage to dopaminergic nerve endings.[3]</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is believed that certain traits in animals such as rats or monkeys etc. work very much the same as they do in humans which is why they use them. Some things don&#39;t translate well to humans, some things do.  I&#39;ve seen that mentioned in various research. I am not going to search the net to find those articles again so yeah, not looking to put in that much effort.</p>

<p>I can guess that some facets of these animals have been observed to work the same or near same in humans which is probably why they stated what they did in the first place. </p>

<p>Even if something translates very well from one species to another, it can&#39;t be taken as fact if not thoroughly vetted in both species. And with limited time, money , resources, research will often remain incomplete while other more interesting or funded or non controversial etc. options are available for research. Big pharma pumps a lot of money into research that can help them prove something works and side effects in the short or near term to pass FDA approval to market. They don&#39;t pump a lot of money into how many years later their product may be damaging peoples brains. Especially when they can at that point blame it on other things or the person in particular and claim that current body of research they funded says it&#39;s safe.  So yes, we do have to make inferences at times because there is nothing more at this current time in history.  And most of the time we can&#39;t cut open peoples brains like we do rats to see what happened so there will always be some obstacles.  There have been former meth addicts who donated their bodies to science so they were able to observe certain structural effects that were also observed in animal studies.  Which adds to the suggestive and circumstantial body of evidence. Obviously there are limitations like limited subjects, lack of definitive personal history, no control group etc. At some point when there is enough of it, you have to admit that at least some of it is likely right. Especially when you can find people who have negative effects to their brain on prescribed doses. </p>

<p>There have been some short term behavioral studies that are in line with in vitro and in vivo studies such as finding some level of withdrawal even at low doses of Adderall. Which  shows there has to be a negative effect in the brain and when something has a negative lasting, even short term, effect by definition it is neurotoxic. </p>

<p>Just take SCT as an example. ADHD was the big buz and got tons of funding since the 80s while SCT was left behind. Yet 30 to 60% of ADHD-I people are comorbid with SCT and of people who have SCT, they find approximately 50% are comorbid with ADHD. Which is literally millions of people in the U.S. yet, not even mentioned in the DSM-V and almost no therapists have even heard of it and yet are treating millions of people who have it. Which may lead to inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis and non optimal selection of medications and therapeutic effect. Should we deny it exists because research is incomplete? Or is it better to acknowledge there is a disorder and that we can infer certain things about it and address it even without complete information?   </p>

<p>Some therapists actually know that amphetamine at prescribed doses can cause RLS, which one common factor is a depletion of dopamine. And depletion of dopamine has been seen in animal studies. And reported in human studies. We can&#39;t conclude 100 percent that it wasn&#39;t caused by another common cause of low iron without testing for that or ruling out any other possible cause of RLS by people reporting it after taking amphetamines. But there is enough evidence for those therapist to treat for low dopamine and adjust Adderall dosage to attenuate the issue without waiting 50 years for conclusive studies to be done.  Other issues seen in animal studies should at least prompt action to attenuate the possible issues instead of potentially damaging people&#39;s brains and causing harm now instead of people 50 years from now.</p>

<p>One persons experience is proof of nothing. but personally, Adderall has been ruining my  life. Was on max dose of Concerta, then started 30mg Adderall XR (equivalent to 15mg 4 hours apart by design). Even at that dose, after a few months it started a downward slope of anhedonia, lack of motivation and energy, muted emotions, low testosterone, decreased libido, weight gain. gradually escalated the dose to 60mg a day. 1.5 years later I was laid off so stopped taking it. Took 6 months to feel normal again. Napping several times a day when before Adderall I could take a nap if at the right time of day. But no way I could keep napping on and off. Everything Adderall was supposed to fix was well below my normal levels for months. When I started it again it took a few weeks to reach the negative aspects and dosage that took months originally. Taking &quot;medication vacations&quot; was a waste. Could notice a difference but didn&#39;t last long enough to justify wasting 3 weeks of my paid vacation to sit at home sleep and watch tv and get nothing I actually need to get done finished or even started. Adderall or dexedrine being the only variable being changed can only conclude Adderall sucks and the last 15 years since has been ruining my life. Yet dependent on it to be functional enough to keep working until last year. And no matter how much I take, damage and downregulation means I haven&#39;t felt &quot;sharp&quot; on it in a decade.  So me and thousands of other can&#39;t simply ignore all the research you choose to ignore. I do take it with a grain of salt and don&#39;t assume it is 100% accurate or things like bromantane will do for me exactly what it has in research articles on animals. Which is why I look for reviews from people on Adderall and the general consensus is that people have benefitted from it as described by research and it is one of the top recommended things by other people taking prescribed amphetamines.  Still inconclusive but far better than flat out denials and accusations of simply peddling bromantane.</p>

<p>Another thing denied over and over again is that amphetamine is excitotoxic to the NMDA receptor cells or that it produces excess glutamate that causes apoptotic cell death and site inconclusive animal trials not replicated in humans. Yet I have seen many people mention being prescribed the Alzheimer&#39;s drug memantine which is a non competitive NMDA receptor antagonist to prevent tolerance and neurotoxicity of those pathways. Some people even claim to repotentiate adderall to a lower dose. Inconclusive evidence in animals being applied to humans and working. </p>

<p>Same thing with Strattera as a weak NMDA receptor antagonist. But with far less research. Yet 3 times in the last 15 years it reduce my 60mg of Adderall to a more effective 40mg even after stopping strattera. The 3rd time I actually kept taking Strattera a few months more and it was still improving my Adderalls therapeutic effect.  I&#39;m convinced those inconclusive claims by researchers that some think NMDA excitotoxicity is the likely largest single route to building tolerance. Unprovent, inconclusive, not proven to translate to humans denied by most therapists and pharma industry. Yet after denying it have not found a single one  of them to even offer a better reason or say why it can&#39;t or even may not be possible. </p>

<p>All in all, after seeing several psychiatrist over the years. sirsadalots post have been shown to have far far more merit with my personal experience than any psychiatrist so far. And for therapists helping to solve the issues I&#39;ve had or even improve anything at all with my Adderall issues and tolerance. Therapists 0 for 6. Me, I lost count but only 1 thing ever didn&#39;t work so around 6 for 7 or so at this point. Much of which based on research on animals and not conclusive or even tried in human studies. Not including trying a few eastern european medications and other things that I was not sure how I would react to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about modafinil which has VMAT2 upregulation? And a ton of articles that all purport neuroprotective effects of modafinil in a number of ways. And I assume armodafinil likely has similar or same effect?<br/>
This article mentions a bunch of ways it can protect against Methamphetamine, which I am assuming has crossover with dextro-amphetamine in ADHD meds.<br/>

Plus anyone i&#39;ve seen in forums who takes it with Adderall etc. Says it has an additive affect when taken together so less adderall needs to be taken overall. Which is also beneficial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I work 5 days a week and not 4. And have to be functional to do other stuff on the weekends. I tried not taking it on weekends but then couldn&#39;t get much done and crashed during the day. Should mention to be fair I have ADHD and convinced I have Sluggish Cognitive Tempo which among other symptoms has sleepiness during the day.<br/>
How long does 5mg last you for the day? Acute tolerance starts to build right away downregulating receptors.  Which is why they recommend a second equivalent dose 4 hours later which doubles the blood concentration just to maintain the same therapeutic dose as when it kicked in earlier for the afternoon.<br/>
And did a therapist rate you on a scale as to about how  affected you are compared to the population of those diagnosed with ADHD? The psychologist who did 3 visits for the testing portion of my diagnosis rated me as between 4 and 7 when I asked. So probably a little more than average. But, that doesn&#39;t factor into me already being on Strattera and getting a therapeutic dose during psych testing phase, so I&#39;d guess worse without it.<br/>
When I was diagnosed I was 32, Working full time a a software engineer so all brain all day. Part time in college working on my masters. Owned an 8 bedroom rooming house that I was learning how to fix, insulate, and deal with the legal system for all my low income tenants not paying. Car that I had to keep fixing, and as not mechanically inclined, learning how to do that. Girlfriend lived 30 minutes away.<br/>
It&#39;s great that you are functional on a minimal dose and don&#39;t have to take it every day. Wish that was an option for me.  But I wonder why bother with Adderall then? Why not ritalin which is less neurotoxic in general? Or better yet why not try a non stimulant like Strattera which will have you therapeutic throughout the day 7 days a week? Or are you possibly stimulated enough by non drugs like ALCAR, Apha GPC, fish oil high in DHA and EPA, Huperzine A, Royal Jelly,  L-Tyrosine, or good old caffeine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supplementing exogenous glutathione will actually lower your glutathione production. If you were to take L serine and n acetyl cysteine then you&#39;d have the building blocks for glutathione and you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about lower glutathione production. L serine/D serine both have many other really awesome benefits besides being building blocks for glutathione. The NMDA influence sirsad brought up would be enhanced by D serine. But I believe El serine contributes more to glutathione production. Someone else can chime in or you can research it better yourself for accuracy purposes  Something else to consider would be adding black seed oil extract or oil itself and sulfurophane and emoxypine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d also mention taking moderate dose B-complex, se-methyl L-selenocysteine, and zync with a little copper. Vitamin Bs are in many reactions in the brain including glutathione production. And when you don&#39;t have the right b vitamin at the right time your brain produces homocysteine instead of methionine  which is bad for example. selenium is also involved and the form I mentioned is purported to not produce ROS, or at least not as much as other forms. And better absorbed. Zinc I think was involved with the cycle as well. Zinc blocks copper absorption so it is recommended when taking a zinc supplement to take one with some copper. I take 15mg zinc with 1mg copper from vitacost. Stays below the zinc upper limit and leaves room for zinc from other sources.  Selenium upper limit is 400mcg a day. I take the se I mentioned from life extensions that is half the upper limit leaving room for other sources during the day.<br/>
Cysteine is the rate limiting factor of glutathione so NAC is the first thing I would take after B-complex. Glycine can also be a lesser factor. I take magnesium bisglycinate which lands me extra glycine while getting my fix of neuroprotective mag.  Also take trimethylglycine. Which is a rare methyl donor that doesn&#39;t get oxidized when the methyl group is donated. And can do it 3 times before leaving you with glycine. But hopefully people can chime in to confirm or correct anything I mentioned. Still a relative noob.</p>

I have ADHD-I and positive it is comorbid with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo  (essentially daytime sleepiness with the added bonus of the brain being, well, sluggish.  Where as regular daytime sleepiness the brain isn&#39;t so sluggish, just sleepy.)  </p>

But Strat wasn&#39;t strong enough after a while. Started out different with amp, but then amp caught up with me and the side effects went in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not entirely sure how I found this post - just looking around for nootropic stuff on reddit, I guess - and I realize your question is two years old, but basically there is ample scientific evidence that in humans, at least those with ADD, very low doses of pharmaceutical grade amphetamine is actually beneficial to the brain from a biological standpoint, aiding in neuronal differentiation, neuron strengthening, neuroplasticity, lower risk of parkinson&#39;s disease due to strengthening of the caudate nucleus*, improved function of the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex, and more.</p>

<p>*interestingly, some studies on folks without ADD suggest that in people without ADD it may <em>increase</em> the risk of Parkinson&#39;s, but not by much, like most people have a 1% chance of getting it and people without ADD taking amphetamines for a long time would have maybe a 1.6% chance at worst.</p>

On I think 3 different occasions.  Even after stopping the Strat.  Obviously 1 persons brain chemistry does not make a research article. But is suggestive that there may be more potential for it than just slowing down. Can allow the glutamatergic system to repair and upregulate too.  Others have had repotentiation results and not just preventative results from memantine. Although sirsadalot has previously expressed a dislike of memantine and suggested it has its own negative profile. My opinion is if stuck on Amphetamines, would be worse without memantine or another NMDA antagonist. But be aware that hypofunctionality from too much blockage of NMDA is also a bad thing. Which is a concern of mine after finding out several things I take are antagonists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what to make of this, I am prescribed 10mg and take it 2 to 4 times a week.
I played around with ALCAR expecting some acute effect, when that didnt happen I upped my dose and inadvertently did other things that increase my acetylecholine (noopept &amp; eggs) which I think caused me to get &#39;choline induced depression&#39; among other things which lasted 3~4 days. That being said, after the 4 days I notice I wake up with more energy than I am used to, this has been the case for the last 2 days so its pretty early to attribute it to ALCAR.
Haven&#39;t been on amphetamines for super long. I never wanted to rely on them long term but too bad for some ADHD folks there is hardly any other options. Which is why I resorted to ordering Bromantane. Very frustrated tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try adding a good fish oil, 4 grams, high in EPA and DHA.  Found that alone enhanced my 40 to 60mg dose of Adderall year after year. It also works with ALCAR which transports omega fatty acids into cells and converts to your bodies fuel ATP for energy.<br/>
With Mounjaro blocking my adderall escalating my dose to 120mg a day (teva or sandoz, not a crappy brand) Taking NAC and ALCAR together helped me keep working after starting to get sleepy for an additional 2 to 4 hours before having to stop for a nap. didn&#39;t notice a difference before getting sleepy but was probably helping. And considering adding max dose of concerta or vyvanse for a bump didn&#39;t even register at all. I may be beneficial for others too. but have to take B-complex to prevent homocysteine generation which has the benefit of also being involved in energy synthesis in the body.<br/>
I tried Alpha GPC and CDP choline and after it built up for a while made me sleepy due to too much choline. So, just take the alpha GPC. Have taken other choline associated and acetylcholine associated things like Huperzine A and noopept and uridine without issues myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Low dose Ketamine seems to be the best yang to the yin of amphetamine… along with delta sleep inducing peptide… bpc-157 can repair damage done through use over time without anything to balance them out, but has an odd way of causing a tolerance or dysfunction of sorts for future amp usage.

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;ve seen references to withdrawal at low prescribed levels, but don&#39;t have the links off hand. But they are out there.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>But, tolerance starts within hours possibly minutes of your first dose, the pharma industry knows this and designed their extended release meds  on it. And dosage recommendations are actually based on the fact. They also mention that a smaller IR dose later in the day can help alleviate the crash at the end of the day, (which is really very minor withdrawal).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2547091/</a></p>

<p>The above link explains acute tolerance and the design of extended release Ritalin And Adderall. Buy design, they account for tolerance within hours and the reason they changed the recommendation for not dosing a small dose IR  later in the day but the same amount later in the day, due to same day tolerance.  Which also explains the reason they recommend &quot;vacations&quot; from your meds.  Like on weekends or a couple days or more every couple weeks etc. To reset that accumulated tolerance that may not have been upregulated.</p>

<p>i.e. When you take MPH or AMP your brain starts trying to get back to homeostasis within hours. So when you take a dose during the morning, by the afternoon you have already built up a tolerance and require a higher blood concentration just to maintain the same therapeutic effectiveness as the morning. Example, with Adderall you take the same dose about 4 hours later essentially doubling your blood concentration, yet, you are just maintaining the therapeutic effect, not doubling it.  Your brain starts shutting down receptors by pulling them into the cell. Need more API to trigger what is left. But, overnight, your brain can upregulate those receptors back into play. Which is how the people who are steady on a smaller dose manage it. Sleep issues that escalate the amount needed the next day, accumulated downregulation or toxicity damage, being on the medication for too long during the day so it stays in your system too long to  fully upregulate during the overnight break. That is how it goes for everyone else.Which is why they changed the recommendation in the 90s and early 2000&#39;s of having a small dose later on to maintain the medication was not working. And the recommendation became same dose 2 or 3 times a day depending on the medication and the person. Which is what the extended release versions attempt to mimic. They try to mimic the AUC curve of TID usage.</p>

<p>The idea that MPH and AMP are equally toxic and addictive is BULLSHIT. MPH does not enter the cell. AMP does. AMP enters the vesicles and kicks out the neurotransmitters. Which directly affects supply. Some ends up in the cytoplasm where it can oxides into ROS, can damage mitochondria and other structures. End up in extracellular limbo where it gets oxidized into ROS. MPH doesn&#39;t do that. AMP does that and inhibits reuptake to boot.  AMP effects DNA in the nucleus affecting long term adaptive changes as well as delta FosB expression.  And really, this is a high level  explanation missing most of the laundry list of what is actually going on.</p>

<p>As an analogy, MPH is like a bouncer at the door not letting people back in. More people in the street making noise. AMP is a DEA raid kicking everyone out. Residents are running out the doors, jumping out windows, some stay in the street in the synapse. Those that take the side doors or jump out window just end up wandering around till they find a purpose or become a zombie and start biting things. Then  DEA starts wrecking the place, while not letting people back in. Residents that get lost or don&#39;t make it out, turn into zombies and start biting things. Eventually P450 comes around and is like WTF? You DEA guys gotta go. The cell is like &quot;is the coast clear&quot;? Then starts opening windows and doors it had recently closed. If the place isn&#39;t to wrecked it tries to clean up. Otherwise it just closes down. MPH is just thinking, all that was unnecessary, just wanted to get some homework done.</p>

<p>On another side note, why haven&#39;t I seen anyone mention how AMP can totally eff up the endocrine system? Mine is wrecked. Done by regular therapeutic doses. Some things it can effect, E.D., Gynecomastia, Low T, high estrogen, infertility, diabetes etc.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I work 5 days a week and not 4. And have to be functional to do other stuff on the weekends. I tried not taking it on weekends but then couldn&#39;t get much done and crashed during the day. Should mention to be fair I have ADHD and convinced I have Sluggish Cognitive Tempo which among other symptoms has sleepiness during the day.<br/>
How long does 5mg last you for the day? Acute tolerance starts to build right away downregulating receptors.  Which is why they recommend a second equivalent dose 4 hours later which doubles the blood concentration just to maintain the same therapeutic dose as when it kicked in earlier for the afternoon.<br/>
And did a therapist rate you on a scale as to about how  affected you are compared to the population of those diagnosed with ADHD? The psychologist who did 3 visits for the testing portion of my diagnosis rated me as between 4 and 7 when I asked. So probably a little more than average. But, that doesn&#39;t factor into me already being on Strattera and getting a therapeutic dose during psych testing phase, so I&#39;d guess worse without it.<br/>
When I was diagnosed I was 32, Working full time a a software engineer so all brain all day. Part time in college working on my masters. Owned an 8 bedroom rooming house that I was learning how to fix, insulate, and deal with the legal system for all my low income tenants not paying. Car that I had to keep fixing, and as not mechanically inclined, learning how to do that. Girlfriend lived 30 minutes away.<br/>
It&#39;s great that you are functional on a minimal dose and don&#39;t have to take it every day. Wish that was an option for me.  But I wonder why bother with Adderall then? Why not ritalin which is less neurotoxic in general? Or better yet why not try a non stimulant like Strattera which will have you therapeutic throughout the day 7 days a week? Or are you possibly stimulated enough by non drugs like ALCAR, Apha GPC, fish oil high in DHA and EPA, Huperzine A, Royal Jelly,  L-Tyrosine, or good old caffeine?</p>
