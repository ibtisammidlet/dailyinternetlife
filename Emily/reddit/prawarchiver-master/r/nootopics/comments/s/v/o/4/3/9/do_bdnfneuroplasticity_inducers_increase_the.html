        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for a definitive answer to this for a while now, but it seems like my knowledge is much too limited to actually extrapolate the data I come across. I know that drugs like noopept (as an example) induce neuroplasticity/genesis which allows them to enhance learned behaviors. In a similar vein, addictive drugs like morphine increase BDNF at first but depress it long term (leading to addictive behaviors similar in effect to a learning disability). It seems logical to me, then, that neuroplasticity tends to encourage the establishment or enforcement of a homeostatic standard. Since drug tolerance may be looked at as a form of adjustment made by your body to maintain homeostasis, will neurotrophic and plasticity-inducing drugs enhance this process? I&#39;m also interested in whether racetams are subsceptible to increasing tolerance due to NMDA/AMPA positive modulation or other actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neuroplasticity is a two-way street, so the answer to your question isn&#39;t so black and white. Both long term potentiation and long term depression are important in the fine tuning of synaptic connections. This process from afar can be observed as learning.</p>

<p>BDNF is ubiquitous and entirely region dependent in terms of its end results. Thus it is not inherently &quot;good&quot; (i.e. nucleus accumbens). What you may be conflating is the increase of it downstream from a tolerance-prone mechanism. The withdrawal of which actually could result in BDNF hypoexpression (i.e. Adderall withdrawal).</p>

<p>To elaborate even further, NMDA antagonists are notorious tolerance reversing drugs that basically work by generating AMPA currents which results in a lot of BDNF and mTOR. This is actually its antidepressant mechanism as well.</p>

<p>Drug addiction is somewhat of a learning disorder, albeit a manufactured one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can only give some anecdotes; noopept taken with amphetamine potentiated the amp desirable effects a fair amount for me when I first mixed them, however when taking amp the next day, all I got was a sugar pill effect and this persisted until i took a 14+ day break. </p>

<p>I have met one other person who had this issue w noopept and amps. (both me and this friend have high functioning autism which I think may predispose one to increased tolerance to substance when taking with neurogenics.)</p>

<p>I also mixed cyclazodone with idra 21 once, and that 20 mg cyclaz had me get better acute effects from cyclaz than ever, however cyclaz was a sugar pill for 1 week after that so I obviously just said ok time for cyclaz break
But even after 2 weeks off, couldn&#39;t get good effects from cyclaz so im nearing thr end of this break, hopefully cyclaz works at 20mg again like it did when i first started it and hadn&#39;t mixed w idra 21.</p>

<p>Tldr: have experienced tolerance fuckery from amphetamine with noopept and if you&#39;ve done the combo, please dm me your results amd your diagnosis (ideally!). I&#39;ve also experienced tolerance fuckery from cyclazodone with idra 21 (idra isnt neurogenic is it.)</p>

<p>My question is; how come I only get the instant severe tolerance from mixing amphetamine and amphetamine like substances (cyclaz) with noopept or idra 21?(noopept and idra both strong ampakines too and I think the answer may lie there)</p>

<p>I should note I&#39;ve taken a variety of neurogenics with a variety of drugs and haven&#39;t had a perceptible alteration in tolerance from doing so, but noopept w amphetamine or cyclazodone with idra 21 cuck me hard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I wish this post had been more successful. In my continued experimenting I&#39;ve decided that noopept probably does fuck with tolerance accumulation. This is based on how it&#39;s affected weed, psychedelics, and stimulants for me (permanently blunting the visuals I experience on psychs) and other friends&#39; anecdotes. No idea if this transfers to non-AMPAkine BDNF signalling/promoting drugs as glutamate could likely be involved in this phenomena.</p>
