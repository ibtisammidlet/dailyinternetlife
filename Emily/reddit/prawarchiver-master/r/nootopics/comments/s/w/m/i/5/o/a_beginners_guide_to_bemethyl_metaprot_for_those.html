        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>BEMETHYL (Metaprot®)2022 — Written with the advisement of several people across various nootropic communities</p>

<p>Bemethyl is an Actoprotector with a relatively unknown mechanism of action. It is believed to have action on DNA transcription, spermatogenesis, possess anti mutagen properties in that it protects DNA from harmful agents such as DNA or mutagens, antioxidant, antihypoxiant, and liver/kidney restorative effects. It is a drug that has been in use for many decades at this point with applications in Eastern European militaries for high altitude training, and for workers who are exposed to environmental hazards. It has shown efficacy in applications including stroke recovery, TBI recovery, and chronic fatigue. Additionally, it has a well-known safety profile that makes it not only tolerable to take but a safe compound to consume over a course of treatment. Like many actoprotectors such as Bromantane, it is hypothesized to have a latent and long-lasting effect post treatment. The duration of this post-treatment action is unknown but believed to be long lasting much like Bromantane.</p>

<p>Metaprot® dosing schedule — Please adhere strictly</p>

<p>It is highly recommended to consume Metaprot® within an enteric coating or within a capsule to maximize its effectiveness as it needs to reach the GI tract to work its main action.</p>

<p>Day 1 : 250mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 2 : 250mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 3 : 250mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 4 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 5 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 6 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Days 7-8 are without Bemethyl. You must not dose during this period to give your body time to adjust to the Actoprotector, and to avoid negative side effects. This should also give you a chance to see how your body is responding to the treatment. Continuation begins on day 9.</p>

<p>Day 9 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 10 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 11 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 250mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 12 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 500mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 13 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 500mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Day 14 : 500mg Morning after a meal (ideally with fats) , 500mg Evening after a meal (ideally with fats)</p>

<p>Once day 15 is reached you do not need to dose. You must discontinue Bemethyl treatment as per the instructions in order to avoid potentially negative side effects. Once you are done with the treatment, no further cycling is needed for at least a month.</p>

<p>Side effects: nausea, upset stomach, sweating, insomnia, oily skin, dehydration and irritability.</p>

<p>Please also note that this regimen only applies to the Metaprot® which is Bemethyl HBr, Bemethyl freebase <strong>does not</strong> work orally.</p>

<p>Anecdotally and from my experience, I&#39;d reckon that it is among one of my favorite nootropic compounds and it has massive potential in the longevity and wellness parts of the nootropic community. I highly recommend it for anyone who is suffering from some sort of mental or physical chronic fatigue or just doesn&#39;t have the motivation To do things. This nootropic has quite literally changed the way how I view life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many studies demonstrating safety and nootropic potential in people, which is good. However I&#39;ve seen no evidence that it has an after-effect like Bromantane (actually the opposite, tolerance). It increases spermatogenesis as well as sex drive initially, and then after 60 days it decreases both which points to a possible hormonal influence which could also play a role in its performance enhancing abilities.</p>

<p>Notably its antioxidant effect could make it an interesting alternative to other antioxidants due to its stimulating abilities, whereas many antioxidants are opposite in nature. This also makes it an interesting pair with D-Serine, which is nootropic but causes oxidative stress.</p>

<p>One Russian source claimed enhanced mRNA synthesis was responsible for its effects, however I have not seen the primary source for this conclusion so I can&#39;t agree yet. It is indeed anti-mutagenic, but that could just be due to it being an antioxidant. As for mRNA synthesis, they said the same about Pemoline but this later failed to replicate. Need more data.</p>

<p>In conclusion it&#39;s a wonderful compound that I may try myself in the future, but I find little merit for its proposed adaptogenic qualities, and overall disagree that it is in the same class as Bromantane, like the &quot;actoprotector&quot; article had tried associating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that it holds very key differences and overall is not like Bromantane. I’ve heard them both classified as actoprotectors but I would say Bromantane is more of a true synthetic adaptogen while I wouldn’t say that of Bemethyl. Though I do find the compound to be quite intriguing none the less. Seems to hold a lot of benefits. Though the research is scarce at least it does hold some safety profile being used widely in Russia for some time. Would be interesting to see you do a test run some day to see what your thoughts on the compound would be!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would honestly skip this stuff. It shares similarities to mitotic poisons used to kill parasites like menbendazole etc. who knows how specific it is to parasitic vs mammalian mitosis? the anti mutagenic effect (a few papers from the 80s) is due to aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation similar to indole 3 carbinol. And it’s partly metabolized by glutathione conjugation which sucks. It might be a non selective Phosphodiesterase inhibitor due to its structural similarities to adenosine or adenosine antagonist. Might as well just use caffeine since caffeine has well understood properties. The anti mutagenic effect of bemethyl was also only against the type of mutagens that require metabolic activation implying that it either inhibits some CYP enzymes, acts as a physical barrier to mutagen attacking DNA, or induces phase 2 detoxification enzymes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if freebase doesn&#39;t work. Beside being stimulatory it has side effects typical for vasodilators like tingling sensation on the face or headache even at 250mg-500mg per dose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s just that freebase lacks oral bioavailability. Freebase works good for other methods of administration I.e. sublingual, injections, or intranasal.</p>
