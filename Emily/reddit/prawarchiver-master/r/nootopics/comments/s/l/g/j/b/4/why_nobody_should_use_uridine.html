        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Uridine is a form of nucleosides sold as either Uridine Monophosphate or Triacetyluridine. Many people use it to &quot;upregulate dopamine&quot; (like with Mr. Happy Stack) as it was shown to treat disorders frequently associated with malfunctioning dopamine networks. But we can all agree those are two vastly different contexts.</p>

<h1>Uridine and cancer</h1>

<p>The carcinogenic action of Uridine is more potent in higher doses, sure, but it is a myth that Uridine isn&#39;t a carcinogen at all doses. Instead of worsening cancer by inducing proliferation, it directly causes DNA damage: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26801745/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26801745/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These data suggest that uridine homeostatic disorder leads to uracil DNA damage and that <strong>pharmacological uridine may be carcinogenic.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Uridine and dopamine</h1>

<p>Uridine&#39;s proposed <em>dopamine upregulation</em> can actually be attributed to it inhibiting dopamine release, making it a hormetic response. The conclusion is drawn from the following paper where this effect was pronounced after chronic use and  actually potentiated antipsychotics: <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019701868990082X?via%3Dihub">https://sci-hub.se/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/019701868990082X?via%3Dihub</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The chronic treatment with uridine alone or associated with haloperidol markedly reduced DA release induced by an acute haloperidol challenge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is mediated by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2906500/">D2</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These results may also suggest that the inhibitory effects of uridine on DA release are dependent on the presence of intact DA D2 autoreceptors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25088943/">GABA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results showed that either systemic or central uridine administration significantly attenuated the hyperactivity induced by acute morphine treatment in mice...  </p>

<p>...  In conclusion, these data suggest that the therapeutic effects of uridine and its metabolites on morphine-induced hyperactivity and established behavioral sensitization may be mediated in part by interfering with the dopaminergic system possibly via agonistic effects at GABAA receptors. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>GABA is most likely responsible for the inhibition of dopamine release, not D2 receptors, but the increase in D2 receptors is not necessarily a good thing. They are receptors designed to regulate dopamine. High D2 agonism or antagonism may align with typical dopamine receptors but mild D2 agonism is inhibitory and mild D2 antagonism could be more dopaminergic. This is the irony of D2 receptors: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25100602/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25100602/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uridine monophosphate is naturally occuring substance available in human milk. It is second most available nucleotide.</p>

<p>&quot;The average concentrations of cytidine, uridine, adenosine, guanosine, and inosine, in milk samples were 9.25 μmol/L, 6.33 μmol/L, 0.18 μmol/L, 0.36 μmol/L, and 0.23 μmol/L, respectively (equivalent to 56.5%, 38.7%, 1.1%, 2.2%, and 1.4% of free nucleoside composition). &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957211000143">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957211000143</a></p>

<p>It has synaptogenic properties and is crucial is phospholipid synthesis.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus, uridine may be more available to brain than cytidine and may be the major precursor in brain for both the salvage pathway of pyrimidine nucleotides and the Kennedy pathway of phosphatide synthesis. This recognition may bear on the effects of cytidine or uridine sources in neurodegenerative diseases.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165017306000439">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165017306000439</a></p>

<p>Ump is synergistic with vitamin c, vitamin e, choline, dha and selenium in phospholipid synthesis. Vitamin b-complex too ( details in the bottom of this post ).</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598848/#&amp;gid=article-figures&amp;pid=fig1-uid-0">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598848/#&amp;gid=article-figures&amp;pid=fig1-uid-0</a></p>

<p>Because of interactions with cytidine, uridine increases production of CDP-choline which shares similar effects to that of uridine supplementation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Treated animals displayed an increase in the dopamine receptor densities of 11% for those receiving 100 mg kg-1 and 18% for those receiving 500 mg kg-1 as compared to the control aged animals that had received no CDP-choline.</p>

<p>The dopamine reducing effects may actually be a good thing. It may prevent stimulant tolerance. Timing and dose is crucial however.Uridine is generally inhibitatory in nature. It induces sleep and is anti-epileptic. It should be taken before sleep or in the evening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 10-h intraventricular infusion of 10 pmol of uridine from 19.00 to 05.00 h resulted in significant increases in sleep in otherwise saline-infused male rats (n = 8) during the environmental dark period (20.00-08.00 h).  </p>

<p>A small dose of uridine (1 pmol/10 h) exerted no effect (n = 6) while larger doses (100 and 1000 pmol/10 h, each n = 5) resulted in slight but insignificant increases in SWS and PS. The 1000-pmol uridine administration seemed to be non-physiological since it brought about irregularities in locomotor activity and sleep-waking rhythm</p>

<p>&quot;Enhanced release of DA by PC was lessened by uridine in mouse striatum.&quot;</p>

<p>CDP-choline may improve PFC metabolism</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Significant increases in phosphocreatine (+7%), beta-nucleoside triphosphates (largely ATP in brain, +14%) and the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (+32%), as well as significant changes in membrane phospholipids, were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex after 6 weeks of citicoline treatment.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18816480/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18816480/</a></p>

<p>Lower dose ( 500mg ) is more effective than higher ( 2000mg ) . Further improvement from higher dose was minimal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These treatment-related alterations in phosphorus metabolites were not only regionally specific, but tended to be of greater magnitude in subjects who received the lower dose.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cytidine may be useful in depression treatment caused by glutaminergic hyperfunction in bipolar subjects</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thirty-five patients with bipolar depression were randomly assigned to receive the mood-stabilizing drug valproate plus either cytidine or placebo for 12 weeks. Midfrontal cerebral glutamate/glutamine levels were measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after 2, 4, and 12 weeks of oral cytidine administration. Cytidine supplementation was associated with an earlier improvement in depressive symptoms (weeks 1–4; p=0.02, 0.001, 0.002, and 0.004, respectively) and also produced a greater reduction in cerebral glutamate/glutamine levels in patients with bipolar depression (weeks 2, 4, and 12; p=0.004, 0.004, and 0.02, respectively). Cytidine-related glutamate/glutamine decrements correlated with a reduction in depressive symptoms (p=0.001).&quot;</p>

<p>Uridine toxicity may be related to cofactor deficiency. Uracil is incorporated into DNA when there is not enough vitamin b12 and folate</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The results clearly showed that there was markedly increased uracil misincorporation into the DNA of vitamin B12- or folate-deficient marrow cells. Misincorporation of uracil into DNA may be an important biochemical lesion underlying both the megaloblastic change and the ineffectiveness of hematopoiesis in vitamin B12 and folate deficiency.&quot;</p>

<p>As you just proved, the concentrations of uridine in human milk are pretty damn low, and you think it&#39;s dose dependent risk. Let&#39;s ignore the resilience of babies to cancer and how brief that period is.</p>

<p>What you provided is <strong>not</strong> proof that uridine is carcinogenic due to B12/ Folate deficiency, and the point of this post is that it is a low grade carcinogen at the doses used. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s endogenous.</p>

<p>Also reducing dopamine is not good for stimulant withdrawal lol. Uridine produces this antidopaminergic cascade that seems to be mediated through GABA and D2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study you provided is not a proof that uridine is cancerogenic. On the contrary it clearly says that cancerogenic effect doesn&#39;t occur in normal mice but only the uridine phosphorylas deficient mice</p>

<p>&quot;Targeted disruption (-/-) of murine uridine phosphorylase (UPase) disrupted the homeostasis of uridine and increased spontaneous tumorigenesis by more than 3-fold. <strong>Multiple tumors (e.g., lymphoma, hepatoma and lung adenoma) occurred simultaneously in some UPase deficient mic</strong>e, but <strong>not in wild-type mice raised under the same conditions.</strong>&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How does that contradict me? The wild type mice are not given uridine. The genetically altered mice had more uridine in circulation and this excess exacerbated carcinogenesis. Cancer is naturally occurring and uridine is a factor.</p>

<p>Hence the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>pharmacological uridine may be carcinogenic.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you stanning for uridine so hard? Nobody that uses it ever gets any positive results and now I am showing evidence that it&#39;s a low grade carcinogen with antidopaminergic effects mediated through GABA and D2 and you&#39;re still defending it.</p>

<p>Nothing in your wall of text disproves the notion that uridine is a low grade carcinogen and not useful for dopamine, yet people are going to see that and not even bother to think critically. The amount of bias that surrounds old ideas is insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has a nootropic effect but it doesn&#39;t upregulate dopamine like people say and your comparison doesn&#39;t work because the mechanism of carcinogenesis is active at all doses, just more prevalent at higher doses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont think many of the claims are applicable to cycled use in normal doses. no one is UPase knocked-out. Carcinogenicity is seen in cells that has no way of dealing with uridine. I like your view on dopamine upregulation but I think you may be being too cautious for this one. also uridine afaik increases dopamine output without affecting basal levels significantly through regulatory mechanisms, which i think is very compatible with a stack that upregulates TH (alcar+bromantane), making highs in life even higher, without significantly influencing basal levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll form 100 tumors at the end of the day either when you supplement uridine but high dose exogenous uridine can produce these results in a timely matter too. The facts are that it is a direct carcinogen, albeit low grade, and this doesn&#39;t require a dose threshold due to the mechanisms.</p>

<p>Uridine can enhance dopamine release from amphetamines via PKC Beta II and D2 but the result is contextual heightened inhibition which is mediated by GABA and serotonin. It decreases dopamine release from other things, such as social isolation, morphine and more; I don&#39;t believe this supports your view of it enhancing the highs in life.</p>

<p>Relevantly, Uridine is a GABA modulator and definitely far from the &quot;dopamine upregulator&quot; it&#39;s portrayed as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck sirsadalot you are the one that recommended it the past. You said it upregulates dopamine, my life is a lie. Anyways, I&#39;m depressed as fuck. I&#39;m on Bupropion 300XL once daily, that helps. Kava helps. I have agmatine sulfate and have been taking 2g daily for a little bit now but I don&#39;t see a major difference. I have multiple posts saved of you praising it I just wish it worked for me like it worked for you.</p>

<p>I have extreme social anxiety and I can&#39;t stop my fucking thoughts from thinking really bad shit.</p>

<p>I do phenibut 500mg 3 times weekly and even on the phenibut days I still kind of feel off.</p>

<p>Also taking guanfacine, I honestly don&#39;t know if it does shit tbh.</p>

<p>I megadose L-Theanine and that doesn&#39;t do shit.</p>

<p>Even with cardio, cold shower and the cocktail of fucking shit  I take I still sometimes feel like shit. Most of the phenibut days are lit though.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve been taking ash ksm-66, idek anymore I am up and down up and fucking down. Sometimes I wake up feeling great and sometimes I wake up feeling like I want to jump off the empire state</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I respect the response. Out of desperation I just dosed another 1g of agmatine 2 hours ago &amp; made some coffee. I drank half the coffee but I think it might be the agmatine. Because I feel on top of the god damn world. It sucks sirsadalot it really does. It&#39;s either I am in mania, ngl or depressed and anxious out of my mind. </p>

<p>Might of been a stupid move and correct me if it&#39;s fine, but I after that 1g of agmatine I totaled to about 2.5g of agmatine for the day. I just dosed another 2g. So now I&#39;m at 4.5g. If my mood/focus increases then I can associate it to the agmatine.</p>

<p>But, I do also want to note that for some reason my Bupropion is really effective at night. Even though I dose it in the morning, the peak effects are around 8 hours after I dose. Weird.</p>

<p>I tried to take it at night so I can wake up energized but then I just end up waking up way too early or having shit quality sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Longvida, robuvit and pomella are easily available in usa. Robuvit is sold by swanson and pomella from nootropicsdepot. You can buy longvida literally everywhere.</p>

<p>Oh and I forgot you can try also pure EPA oil like vegEPA, high epa EyeQ or superba2 krill oil. For me they are powerful nootropics though not very agreeable with my stomach. Nevertheless there is a strong evidence of usefulness in mood disorders</p>

<p>&quot;Some studies have also demonstrated that different dosages of EPA and DHA may result in different levels of efficacy. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that EPA, mostly at dosages of 1 or 2 g/d, was better (than placebo and DHA) as a monotherapy or adjuvant in the <strong>treatment of mild to moderate depression and that the ratio of an ‘active’ synergetic effect between EPA and DHA would probably be either 2:1 or 3:1</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Compared with placebo, EPA-pure (=100% EPA) and EPA-major formulations (≥60% EPA) demonstrated clinical benefits with an EPA dosage ≤1 g/d (SMD = −0.50, P = 0.003, and SMD = −1.03, P = 0.03, respectively), <strong>whereas DHA-pure and DHA-major formulations did not exhibit such benefits</strong>.<br/>
Current evidence supports the finding that omega-3 PUFAs with EPA ≥ 60% at a dosage of ≤1 g/d would have beneficial effects on depression. Further studies are warranted to examine supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs for specific subgroups of subjects with inflammation, severity of depression, and the dose response for both EPA and DHA supplementation.&quot;</p>

<p>If it is pure dxm it&#39;s ok. Just remember dxm can be toxic and addictive. In studies for depression treatment they used doses</p>

<p>&quot;AXS-05 was titrated to a final dose of 45 mg dextromethorphan and 105 mg bupropion twice daily&quot;</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t take it before any serious mechanical or mental work because it is dissociative.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I usually don&#39;t try to provide medical advice and I&#39;m not qualified to do so but your case seems serious and you have already seeked medical assistance with little success if I got it correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like me. I have atypical bipolar (not type I - the one everyone&#39;s familiar with - or type II, but some other type not yet recognized officially let alone garnering any pharmaceutical development).</p>

<p>My cycle can be 3 days sometimes or it can be a week or a month or two.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t get manic so to speak, I get a kind of hypomania where I&#39;m more impulsive and eccentric, more prone to spending a lot of money and being generally irresponsible, stuff like that. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m always heavily, abysmally depressed, and so it&#39;s just worse for that part of my cycle.</p>

<p>On top of that I have the most extreme social anxiety it&#39;s literally crippling and I used to be a complete shut in that didn&#39;t even eat because anxiety about the checkout at the grocery store.</p>

<p>I also have ADHD and I had a polysubstance addiction too when I was younger. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still reliant on a few key chemicals to stay functional but cycled to eliminate addiction, tolerance and to reduce the onset time of permanent loss of efficacy (I&#39;ve experienced with almost everything)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to help you because I havent figured it out myself...</p>

<p>For depression the thing that brought me back from absolute rock bottom was ketamine, once or twice was all it took but it is not permanent yet the tolerance is. I take a single dose prob 3-4 times a year.</p>

<p>Microdosing LSD between every 4 days to once every week, or sometimes a couple weeks without has been keeping me positive and energized on those days, and mood better than in the gutter on the other days...</p>

<p>ADHD meds are harder though, addictive personality and impulse control plus depression and apathy about my life isn&#39;t a good combo to have a big bag of stims laying around but practice and maturity has helped me manage to take 10mg of 4f-mph every 4 days to help be productive and focused (it sucks though IMO and I think ritalin would be best but I&#39;m not able to afford it illegally). It can also set off a pretty strong swing in my cycle so it&#39;s hard to balance. Plus doctors are reluctant to prescribe anything for it due to the bipolar and anxiety... Also my history but fuck that I was immature, I&#39;m a god damn post secondary graduate, a scientist now and not addict, just trying to keep my life on track because it feels like I&#39;m playing this game on the highest damn difficulty setting...</p>

<p>Sleep problems are a bitch for me and always have been but benzos were a horrible idea. Modafinil or fl-modafinil (CRL-40,940) have been helpful with that... Magnesium perhaps too and vitamin D is essential (I&#39;m Canadian and don&#39;t go outside much either so I take 5000iu)</p>

<p>Doctors and psychs don&#39;t have much clue how to help so far due to all these comorbidites but I&#39;m still trying.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried 10-15 different meds like antidepressants and antipsychotics and mood stabilizers but nothing worked, only escitalopram and only for about a year before it didn&#39;t anymore and stopping it was 1.5 years of absolute hell that nearly destroyed my life.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried hundreds of noots and supplements too, research chems as well but the only consistency is nothing works for very long... </p>

<p>Fucking pandemic made all this shit so much worse too and now supply issues and bans are affecting my access to what&#39;s basically my medications so that&#39;s fun as fuck to try to keep my life on track.</p>

<p>Kicks in faster, like 30 mins for me too, and dosage is in the 50-200mg range rather than one to several grams like Phenibut.</p>

<p>I tend to respond really well to cholinergics in terms of improved cognition and motivation..</p>

<p>But I also risk getting hypercholinergic, which means unbearable stress for me, I think it worsened my PTSD.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a bell curve, both ends have an extreme negative impact on me, the middle is perfect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so it would actually decrease the perceived &#39;high&#39; via increasing inhibition through modulation of GABA, even though it increases potassium evoked DA release, renderimg it irrelevant?</p>

<p>also have you yourself given it a chance for a while? i was considerimg adding TAU to alcar+bromantane but now im not so sure if it is actually contradictory to the main aim of the stack.</p>
