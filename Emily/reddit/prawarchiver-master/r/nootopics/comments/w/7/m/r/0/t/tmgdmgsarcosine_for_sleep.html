        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Which of these is best for sleep? I&#39;m trying to find a methyl group donor that would be good for sleeping. For Sarcosine I have found this:</p>

<p>Decreased need for sleep</p>

<p>for DMG:</p>

<p>DMG helps my sleep tremendously when I&#39;m in the mountains. (lol?)</p>

<p>I am not sure I need a decreased need for sleep - I had high hopes for sarcosine. Some folks in here also advise against glycine altogether. But why? Yes, glycine can be synthesized out of serine, but serine can be synthesized out of threonine (and even out of glycine, as many reactions are reversible). Why not take threonine instead then, if we are going all the way back to the source?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve read experiences with TMG and better sleep, but never tried it myself. It seems generally to give me energy and decrease inflammation, both of which I don’t want to do around bed time. I’m taking it in the morning though.</p>

<p>Personally I use Taurine and Glycine before bed - works well and no tolerance. I can definitely see the arguments against using both of these… but it works</p>

<p>Lately I’ve also been using Ceylon Cinnamon 2.5g. Feels like I’m waking up less groggy - like my BS and breathing’s been better during the night.</p>

<p>Additionally I’ve never had any success with nmdar antagonism close to bed - my hypothesis is that the glutamate activity is being increased at other receptors causing me to wake up early and/or sleep lighter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t decreasing inflammation good at any time? Taking a NSAID every day (like ibuprofen) supposedly extends life?</p>

<p>Yeah, I also am taking Taurine and Glycine (and more), but why would anyone have anything to say against those? Taurine is good for the eyes, a huge + for me.</p>

<p>Did you every try glutamine before bed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, it’s more dependable. You’d want a bit higher tnf alpha closer to bedtime. I think this is something that’s also noticeable - if your inflamed you’d get more tired. </p>

<p>One of the things both Taurine and Glycine does is agonising GABA A receptors. There’s other things which might give you reasons to not use them - which I don’t remember now.</p>

<p>I do take glutamine, but in the morning.
I fast and drink huge amounts of coffee, it might help a bit - not sure.</p>

<p>I think you should closer define what you think would be beneficial to affect for you in relation to sleep. Some of these could be:
- Adenosine
- GABA B
- Sleep wake cycles
- Cholinergic activity
- Growth factors
- Blood sugar 
- etc…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of GABA can&#39;t do any harm, a little pheni helps me a lot before bed. It&#39;s ever harder to purchase anything here. Glycine isn&#39;t bad for me, I was just trying to do more than just glycine with DMG/TMG. Methionine is rare and if some it gets recycled, that&#39;s good, I guess. Alternatively, I could take just glycine and some other methyl group donor.</p>

<p>EDIT: Leonurus cardiaca extract before bed?</p>
