    <div class="md"><p>VMAT2 usually packages dopamine into vesicles, where it releases it normally. Upregulating it increases the amount of dopamine that is packaged into vesicles and subsequently released.</p>

<p>Amphetamine inhibits VMAT2, thereby increasing the amount of dopamine floating around in the cytosol. By reversing the flow of transporters via TAAR1 activation, this cytosolic dopamine is pushed out through the transporters into the synapse.</p>

<p>TLDR: inhibiting VMAT2 generally only increases synaptic dopamine when transporters are also reversed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common misconception! TAAR1 actually negatively modulates monoamine release <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1103029108">https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1103029108</a>. TAAR1 agonists reduce amphetamine induced DA release and are being researched for substance use disorders and schizophrenia!</p>

<p>Wikipedia relies on old research that isn’t being replicated today, and I think that’s a large source of this TAAR1 confusion. The old research is certainly interesting, but TAAR1 is clearly not the only mechanism of release, as TAAR1 knockout <em>increases</em> amphetamine induced DA release.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TAAR1 doesn’t phosphorylation the DAT on its own—it was never thought to. It was believed to be via PKC. There are two major sources of DAT phosphorylation—PKC and CaMKII. Knockout of either severely blunts releaser effects. </p>

<p>Inhibiting PKC has no effect on TAAR1-mediated <em>suppression</em> of cocaine-induced DA uptake inhibition (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14472-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14472-z</a>), but does appear to inhibit TAAR1-mediated <em>promotion</em> of amphetamine-induced DA release (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17234899/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17234899/</a>). The disinhibitory actions of TAAR1 on the DAT appear to rely on GSK-3 inhibition via functional heteromerization of TAAR1 with D2 receptors. So, the notion that TAAR1 activates PKC may not be wrong, but it does not compete with GSK inhibition that leads to disinhibiting inhibited transporter function. </p>

<p>So, if not TAAR1, then what about PKC and CaMKII? For both of these, internal Ca2+ is required (<a href="https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/297/3/1016">https://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/297/3/1016</a>). Phospholipase C was shown to have a stimulatory effect on amphetamine-induced dopamine release, whereas phospholipase A2 has an inhibitory effect. The PLC activity is supposedly dependent on internal Ca2+. One proposed mechanism of internal Ca2+ increase is the Na/Ca antiporter. Also, newer research points to functional coupling between DATs and voltage-gated calcium channels, in which amphetamine can activate these VGCCs through the DAT! (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26162812/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26162812/</a>) More recently, amphetamine’s effects on SERT and NET (which is very similar to DAT) efflux are attenuated by PLC activation and subsequent reduction in PIP2 (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23798435/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23798435/</a>). The products of this, DAG, which activates PKC, and IP3, which releases internal Ca2+, which ought to increase efflux, do not increase efflux, likely due to inhibition of PIP2. The reason for this was unknown until recently, when it was shown that PIP2 interacts with the DAT and is crucial for DAT phosphorylation (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0620-0">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0620-0</a>). However, necessary != sufficient. As such, things like IP3, Ca2+, and PKC can and do indeed play a role. Ca2+, as well as the PLC product, DAG, can activate PKC (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_C</a>). Also, Ca2+ can activate CaMKII. </p>

<p>An entirely new theory is the kinetic theory, which says “fuck you” to all that secondary messenger garbage above. It basically says: amphetamine binds to DAT, DAT sucks up amphetamine, amphetamine unbinds from DAT in inward-facing conformation, dopamine binds to DAT in the same state, and then dopamine is released as the DAT returns to the outward-facing conformation. See details here: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439119/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29439119/</a>. </p>

<p>Methamphetamine also as a sigma-1 agonist enhances IP3-mediated internal Ca2+ release, which may account for why it can release more dopamine than amphetamine (apart from the more obvious lipophilicity theory). </p>

<p>So, there you have it (until new research comes out once again LOL): amphetamine causes release via PKC and CaMKII phosphorylation of the DAT, which requires PIP2 at the DAT, Ca2+ and DAG at PKC, and Ca2+ at CaMKII, and perhaps sufficient PLC (vs. excessive PLC activation which depletes PIP2 to the point that PKC/DAG doesn’t matter). The Ca2+ can be directly from amphetamine from VGCCs or the Na/Ca antiporter, or PLC-mediated IP3 formation and subsequent endoplasmic release, etc. And/or the kinetic theory as a contributor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck me, nice write up. Am I correct in saying that TAAR1 would then only lead to phosphorylation if heteromerized with D2, which is a separate pathway to the TAAR1-GSK3 route?</p>

<p>Also, kinetic theory sounds interesting. Makes sense considering cocaine was thought to stabilize DAT in an outward facing confirmation from memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, D2 heteromerization is inhibitory, and is necessary for TAAR1 decreasing dopamine release (think Gi coupling/cAMP decrease, GIRK channels, etc.). This dopamine decreasing property makes the advent of TAAR1 agonists in scz and substance use disorders appealing. DAT phosphorylation via TAAR1 and efflux can still occur, but the effect of TAAR1-D2 via GSK3 (this is the all the same pathway), which seems to dominate TAAR1 activating PKC. I don’t know if the GSK3 thing is related to the phosphorylation directly though. </p>

<p>Yes! I love the DAT inverse agonist theory too. Interestingly, cocaine’s effects on dopamine are attenuated by calcium channel blockers (for amphetamine, it is less clear cut, but there may be no or much less effect). This is likely due to the importance of calcium signaling in vesicular release. This is reinforced by the fact that cocaine is dependent on action potentials (and VGCCs), and amphetamine is not. A theory unifying VGCCs/Ca2+, “inverse agonists,” releasers, and catecholaminergic activity enhancers (CAEs) like PPAP would be very appealing. I’ve also written extensively on how I think PPAP is an inverse agonist like cocaine due to the action-potential dependence, calcium uptake dependence, and how inverse agonists and releasers might both recruit those DAT-VGCCs via conformational changes, but with inverse agonists simply allowing for perhaps increased VGCC activation (thru tighter coupling) and dopamine “release” after action potential, whereas amphetamine would additionally allow for its direct effluxing effect kinetically due to its ability to travel thru the DAT (whereas cocaine, MPH, and PPAP cannot fit and therefore just “lock” the DAT), as well as the DAT phosphorylation efflux aspect.</p>
