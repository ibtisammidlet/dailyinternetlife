<p>This bromantane source and the nasal spray have become very popular from what I&#39;ve seen so I&#39;m going to order from <a href="https://bromantane.co">bromantane.co</a> now.</p>

<p>My sweet spot is <strong>50mg sublingual</strong> after a lot of trial and error and I&#39;m afraid to get inconsistent results with the nasal spray at the beginning for not being able to dial in the dose. </p>

<p><strong>Have any of you used 50mg sublingual before and switched to the nasal spray with the same results? If so, what dose do you use?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have gathered 2 sprays total is equivalent to 50mg sublingual if not a bit stronger like mentioned above. I’ve started mine 5 days ago and I do 3 sprays at 27mg total and feel amazing on it. May even go down to 2 sprays after a week or so considering long term effects will build up.</p>

<p>I’ll do my sprays and immediately lay down on my bed on my side and position my pillow accordingly so that the oil mixture perfectly sits in my nasal cavity. Doesn’t drip out and doesn’t go back to my throat. After just a few minutes (2-4) everything for the most part settles just where you want it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for your response, that&#39;s very helpful! Do you care to elaborate about the long term effects building up? I know it upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase and that&#39;s his primary mechanism of action but never head about long term effects of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I purchased it from this vendor <a href="https://Bromantane.co">Bromantane.co</a> and did not like my experience, seems like the ”company” is run by a kid in his parents basement. They were out of stock for weeks so it was on back order and the emails this guy was sending was pretty unprofessional and bizarre, but thats just a side note.   </p>

<p>I took this for 4 days and did not have very good results. (2 sprays per nostril per day) First, I think it was the secondary preserative ingredient that made my nose feel like it had some kind of oil wax covering inside my entire nose and sinuses, and I couldn’t get the smell out of my nose for half of the day.   </p>

<p>Then the effects were slightly stimulating but nothing to break the bank over, and this stuff isnt cheap. I had a massive headache by day 2 and was running on nausea and with an overall agitation that wouldnt stop. Thats just what I experienced. I think Bromantane is way over hyped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://Bromantane.co">Bromantane.co</a> is run by the owner of this sub, fyi. His research and write-ups about nootropics are very extensive and all claims are backed by research. I don&#39;t doubt his capability to run a successful nootropics company, based on his previous work.</p>

<p>The smell is caprylic acid - a medium chain triglyceride found in coconut oil, which is what the Bromantane is diluted in.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate Bromantane didn&#39;t work for you u/Dangerous_Sundae3138, but it has worked for many people - specifically those with issues relating to low dopamine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard of that one actually. The only thing that I discovered by ginny pigging myself for years with nootropics is that it was never just one thing that would be the winning magic, I had to do a combo of supplements to get the best effects.</p>

<p>I found that PL-Phenylalanine, Magnesium, Omegas, B-Vitamins, L-Theanine, (digestive herbs to move things out regularly like Magnesium Oxide), Phosphatidylserine along with Sabroxy, Guarana and Panax Ginseng worked the best to take daily.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a lot here and I might even have left out one or two more but I think when it comes to taking the natural route I&#39;ve never found a one and done kind of deal unless you just give up and take a stimulant medication and that is what I had to do in the end after years of trying otherwise, as I had pretty severe untreated ADHD and anxiety and depression issues that was a result of the ADHD being untreated.</p>

<p>I will also say that I still have to take a lot of these natural supplements in addition to taking my stimulant medication that is prescribed for me.</p>

<p>Besides all that, I hope you find something that works for you and you won&#39;t have as many issues as I did trying to find the right ones. It&#39;s like that combo worked to an extent, so it all really depends on your current health and if you have attention issues etc. as you might get really good results from just a few of those that I mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cerebrolysin is more of a healing medication to reverse certain types of damage to the brain and needs to be injected. As a nootropic for healthy people it&#39;s a waste of money.  </p>

<p>P21 spray is a nasal derivative with (and I might be misquoting this) an  adamantine molecule attached making it effective. (they are connected somehow at least)  </p>

<p>The spray if super expensive tho. I&#39;m looking to try Methylene blue as a nootropic. The data on it is astounding, Just need to be careful about heavy metal contaminations and interactions with serotonergic medications. (could be fatal)</p>

<p>One of the mechanisms is a major improvement in brain oxygenation, but there are a host of mechanisms that help reverse damage, recover from stroke, improve memory and learning capacity,  </p>

<p>And it&#39;s also a dye and malaria med from back in the day. Just need to be careful with the dose response curve, 0.5mg per kg seems to be optimal and safe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. It takes some getting used to at the beginning, you have to make sure you&#39;re using proper technique or you will have bromantane running down your nose. But now that I have gotten used to it I&#39;m definitely not going back to sublingual. Just 2 sprays is more than enough for me to get the same effect, if not stronger. I&#39;m going to try just 1 spray next time.</p>
