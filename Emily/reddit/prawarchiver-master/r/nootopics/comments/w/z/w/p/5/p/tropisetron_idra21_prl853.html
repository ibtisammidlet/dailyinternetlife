        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been stacking tropisetron, idra-21, prl-8-53 for about 2 weeks now, almost daily.Of course, sourced from yours truly;)</p>

<p>I was aware that idra-21 and prl-8-53 would be difficult to notice without proper opportunites that would allow its prominence. I mean, if you&#39;re not doing much it&#39;s difficult to gauge the difference in memory/learning. But my work + study environment is pretty demanding, so I thought my chances of noticing its effects wouldn&#39;t be so bad. While stacking, I even thought I had moments where I definitely felt different. Turns out, the effects are even more subtle that I&#39;d imagined.</p>

<p>Just hours ago I remembered that I&#39;d recorded my scores from <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com">humanbenchmark.com</a> about two months ago, so I decided to  give it another go. I got slightly~meaningfully improved scores over all areas except typing and reaction time. But the stack&#39;s effect of short-tem memory, at least for the sequence memory test is quite hard to believe. I was already in the 20-21 range before, but today I got a 35. I forgot to save my results, so I went ahead and took just the sequence memory game again - 36. And I knew I could just keep going, except I felt enough is enough. I&#39;m not sure if the stack is helpful for other tests, but it surely is for the sequence memory. (Improvements in chimp test and others were there, but I&#39;m not sure whether the differences are large enough to comfortably discredit luck or a &#39;good brain&#39; day.)</p>

<p>In terms of side effects, I&#39;ve been constipated, which I knew would come with tropisetron. I&#39;ve also had some other unpleasant experiences (including short bursts of headaches), but it&#39;s difficult to say that the stack played a part in them. I&#39;m just not sure. But it&#39;s more reasons to be excited about tak-653, i&#39;ll be replacing idra-21 with tak-653 as soon as it comes out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not trying to promote any of these. If one were to try, I would strongly suggest addding these to your stack one by one. I made the foolish decision to start all of them together, so I don&#39;t know which one of these is playing the major part in my improvements/potential side effects. But I wanted to share my experience about the effects, especially since I saw a quantitative improvement that would be difficult to explain without the stack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep, I think the increase in score is primarily due to prl-8-53.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to get myself to get off one or two of the substances in my stack, to figure out causal relationships between the experienced positive/side effects and individual subtances. I&#39;ll write about it if I ever get to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replaced it with tak-653, still have some left.<br/>
Have done less productive work on tak, so can&#39;t tell whether I&#39;m finding more utility wiht this than idra-21.<br/>
It isn&#39;t hard to find, checkout <a href="https://bromantane.co">bromantane.co</a><br/>
(tak-653, on the otherhand, is hard to come by)</p>
