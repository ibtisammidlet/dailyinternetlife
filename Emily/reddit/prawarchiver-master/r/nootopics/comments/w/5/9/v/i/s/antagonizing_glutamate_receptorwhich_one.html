        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi! I have abnormal had anxiety(and anhedonia) for most of my life which has made me interested in nootropics/pharmacology/neuroscience but still learning the basics..</p>

<p>Is there any one here that knows, which glutamate receptor that is involved in anxiety? All of them?</p>

<p>Also i have taken benzos a little too much the past 1-2 months, I’m thinking of trying either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Block NMDA</li>
<li>Block kainate</li>
<li>Block AMPA
(Antagonists, NAMs or some other way I don’t know yet)</li>
</ol>

<p>So which do you think, inhibited, will ease anxiety most?</p>

<p>And also which would ease benzo WD most?</p>

<p>Thanks for reading wish u the best!:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coincidentally, I stumbled upon a compound named <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GYKI_52466">GYKI 52466</a> yesterday. It’s an atypical, non-NMDAR-antagonistic benzodiazepine that highly antagonizes AMPA/kainate receptors selectively. </p>

<p>It seems to fit your criteria very well (besides the memantine for the NMDAR antagonism already mentioned), but sadly, its optimal dosage protocol (together with administration and bioavailability) isn’t known, as a lack of human research makes it hard to make conclusions. Even though it’s labeled as a benzo, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Lack-of-binding-affinity-of-2-3-benzodiazepines-to-GABA-A-GABA-B-receptors-and-BDZ_tbl2_5489446">it barely binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors</a>, so it MAY help with GABA withdrawal. Also, it’s expensive as shit.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18363046/">This</a> is the (rodent) study that got my attention in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but memantine did wonders for me when I was tapering phenibut, it made me *normal*. The glutamate surges were unbearable when I tried to quit cold turkey, tapering with agmatine was okayish but the anhedonia was killing me. Once I started taking memantine 5mg for the first week then 10mg next I actually felt normal again even motivated. The first week taking memantine was rough with brain fog but it cleared up the next. It is not a competitive NMDA antagonist, it only blocks the excess glutamate released caused by disbalance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: and NMDA antagonists i have tried allready</p>

<p>Curiosity for sure is one, and i read somewhre about kainate being more important in at least benzo WD and maybe anxiety(?)</p>

<p>I would like to try antagonizing the three receptors at different days and see What happens kinda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahahaha please don&#39;t do this. Kainate receptors are still in fairly early research and AMPA receptors are ESSENTIAL for learning, memory, antidepressant response, etc. Just use memantine, there&#39;s no reason to be extra when it&#39;s your own brain you&#39;re gambling with. The glutamate system is unpredictable and you don&#39;t want to fuck it up, especially right out of benzo wd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look for valerian root ticture, you can even made a tea from dried valerian root, it will help alleviate benzo WD and it will decrease the anxiety.<br/>
If you did cold turkey it will be a big difference.</p>

<p>If you are tapering it might make no difference. </p>

<p>Do not use it for prolonged periods of time.</p>

<p>It is not a medical advice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;d be best off blocking NMDA. There&#39;s a metric known as NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio. Admittedly, I don&#39;t understand this particularly well, but it basically measures the degree to which NMDA and AMPA receptors respectively contribute to excitatory post synaptic potentials. I believe it&#39;s thought that chronic stress raises this ratio (i.e. increases NMDA and lowers AMPA signaling), although I&#39;m not certain that this is done by modulation of the actual number of receptors of each. </p>

<p>As a practical matter, NMDA antagonists are much easier to come across. Also, both NMDA antagonists and AMPA PAMs have shown antidepressant-like effects. In the case of NMDA, it may be that blocking it induces a compensatory mechanism which raises AMPA signaling, thereby increasing BDNF, which is thought to alleviate depressive disorders.</p>

<p>YMMV but I think a sensible plan would be to trial and NMDA antagonist, then switch to an AMPA antagonist if this provides no benefit. I don&#39;t know enough about the kainate receptor to say anything useful about that. Let me know if you want sources for any of this stuff and I&#39;ll try to dig them up later. Good luck fren!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its alot more complicated because certain neurotransmitters react differently at different sites of the brain. I think the issue with anxiety is a hyperactive amygdala which needs a stronger mpfc to control it, so a more targeted approach to these areas would work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you find a solution ?</p>

<p>Ive come to the conclusion that I have glutamate excitatory issues, phenibut worked wonders for me although it isn&#39;t something you can use everyday. I&#39;ve been looking into gabapentin / pregabalin as it seems to have potential for these issues</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What other modalities are there for long-term GABA-A mediated disturbances?</p>

<p>After a decade on Etizolam I feel as if I&#39;ve fried my receptors beyond point of homeostatic rebalancing, which will culminate in my suicide no earlier than August but no later than September 2024.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of GABA-A partial allosteric modulators such as Imidazenil and a few others, but custom synthesis would be prohibitive, also in view of lack of literature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much etizolam were you using? Lol</p>

<p>Yes, so these case studies are on people being dependant on opioids or Xanax for decades +.</p>

<p>Lamotrigine is also a good one for other uses like GABA current stability. But topiramate would be the primary one..</p>

<p>They are not dangerous to combine per say, you just need to lower the doses in accordance.</p>

<p>To rebuild the neurons, or at least help restore some density, things like BPC-157 works in particular for studies looking at diazepam.</p>
