        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">17</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2022-08-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Bierak.html">Bierak</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In recent times I have experimented with Sunifiram again after years of having a reserve in the refrigerator at temperatures below 0 degrees.</p>

<p>Is sunifiram as harmful and dangerous as its bad reputation shows? I don&#39;t know, it would be an interesting question that someone could answer by looking at its mechanism of action:-CaMKII and PKCalpha activation-Glycine binding site activation of the NMDA receptor</p>

<p>Sunifiram is supposedly an ampakine, but due to its effects and due to its mechanism of action do not seem to be one, nor would I put it under the controversial category of nootropic, for me it is more of a Cognitive Enhancer and surely one of the most effective that exists.</p>

<p>Risk of excitotoxicity? Surely yes, as I currently take memantine 3 mg a day, that was one of the reasons why I dared to experiment with Sunifiram again. It feels very different than IDRA-21 also.</p>

<p>Years ago Sunifiram at doses of 5 - 10 mg sublingual always gave me an enhanced speed of cognitive process, it was like increasing the playback speed by x2 however it was free of chaos and tangles when speaking. Tha was without Memantine. Recently I started to dose it at 2 - 5 mg orally with Memantine 3 mg, Phosphatydylcholine. It was powerful for increasing memory retention, I remember very well what I read that day, however  It reduced the speed of comprehension very much, it was much easier to lose sight of what was being studied, it was a lot of visual immersion in the present...</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Sunifiram is that it has a little explored mechanism of action, 200% acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex, but that only occurs in low doses.</p>

<p>&quot;Sunifiram injections at 0.01mg/kg are able to facilitate acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex of rats, with no apparent efficacy at 1mg/kg.[4] The magnitude was around 200% of baseline within an hour of injection.[4] &quot;Therefore, in small doses it releases Acetylcholine but in higher doses it does not have that effect. This is something I have been able to verify in the last experiments, even in doses as low as 0.2 mg, the increase in perception is similar to when you consume nicotine for the first time, it is like being much more immersed in the present in a spatial way, which for reading texts is wonderful. It is like to walk, it is like to navigate in a spatial way what you are seeing, what you are reading, reading books becomes something pleasant.</p>

<p>It is important to clarify that I do not have problems with excess acetylcholine, when I dose sunifiram in such low doses I am also consuming Convolvulus Pluricaulis (Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor) and phosphatidylcholine, however for many it could be too much acetylcholine. I think that at such low doses Sunifiram poses much less risk. Actually as I see it the big problem with Sunifiram is its mechanism of action from CaMKII and PKCalpha. From wikipedia &quot;<strong>CaMKII</strong> is a serine/threonine specific protein kinase that is regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex. CaMKII is involved in many signaling cascades and is thought to be an important mediator of learning and memory.[1]  CaMKII is also necessary for Ca2+ homeostasis and reuptake in cardiomyocytes,[2]  chloride transport in epithelia,[3]  positive T-cell selection,[4]  and CD8 T-cell activation&quot;It could interact with a lot systems, so It is easer to feel that you are playing with fire....</p>

<p>And I want say it, I have stacked low doses of it with much things: IDRA-21 for example, the Uridine stack, herbs Garlic and Olive extract (longevity and cardioprotectant), ALCAR, Methylphenidate (ADHD prescribed), low doses PDE5 inhibitor all the same day. (yes PDE5 inhibitors could work as a cognitive enhancer due to increased blood flow to the PFC, it increases neurite outgrowht)</p>

<p>At least, as I said before 3 mg Memantine works very well to prevent excess NMDA firing to me. It is also easily soluble in H20 so it is so easy to make a solution in a amber glass dropper bottle.<br/>
Also it does not loose effects afte 3 days of continous dose at 0.2 mg.  I used it to write an essay in record time over three days.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slightly off topic. I suspect I have abnormal level of extra synaptic glutamate but less NMDA receptor activation. How do I fix it? Sublingual sacrosine 1gm makes me active and peppy at times. </p>

<p>Background - I have all negative symptoms of schizophrenia (especially the negligible emotions and zero motivation) but never positive symptoms since childhood. Recently diagnosed with ADHD inattentive and on Ritalin but it doesn‚Äôt do much. Ritalin only stops dopamine in synaptic space from being absorbed. But what if you have low dopamine firing  to begin with? especially on mesocortial pathway as I live in the moment and have no motivation for medium term and long term tasks which require planning. </p>

<p>Now low dose marijuana makes me very motivated and I experience emotions I have never experienced in my life. Words have meaning. Idioms have meaning. Movies are lively. I can cry. I feel motivated to conquer the world. All of the things which neurotypicals can do all the time. THC impacts CB1 receptor and acts as indirect agonist for NMDA receptor among other things. </p>

<p>Can anyone knowledgeable help out here? I live in a third world country and generic Ritalin is the best out there. Docs don‚Äôt give a shit and I have never studied biology after high school. Doing my own research for nearly one year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You look as a good candidate for low dose aripiprazole 1 - 2 mg. It enhances mesocortical dopamine transmission.
Look at glutamatergics... Low dose racetam like Piracetam, or perhaps Pregnenonole.
Memantine could prevent excess nmda firing, however what do you need is to enhance nmdar receptors. If your speculations are correct, low nmda receptor sensitivity could lead excess extrasynaptic glutamate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for responding. I hope my theory is on the right track.</p>

<p>I just started aripiprazole 2.5mg daily since yesterday. Should I taper it to 1mg? I am planning to do it anyways in 4 days once the dose reaches its half life. </p>

<p>Quick [google search](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/</a>) shows Pregneleone enhances NMDA activation but in cerebellum region. Will this be a part of mesocortial pathway? What dose are you talking here?  I have 50mg pills from life extension with me.</p>

<p>Piracetam increases receptor density which absolutely makes sense to try. What doses do you have in mind?</p>

<p>Dont want to try memantine as the purpose is to enhance nmdar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first time i try sunifirma. Start with 2 x 5mg.  No effekt  - Next 2 days i take 2 x 15 mg. Also no effekt.<br/>
Every 2 day i increase. Now i am on dailey dose from 3 x 20mg.  Maybe i feel a litle subtile effect but i am not sure. Audiobook with speed x 3 i can hear without problems.<br/>
NO sideeffekts. I take it sublingual.<br/>
I have read there some people who must take more to have a effect.<br/>
What i must say i am in general a person who have a high tolerance against stimulants ans psychedalics.<br/>
But sunifirma is a new chemical for me. Thats i take care on the first time like with all other chemicals.<br/>
Did anyone have also so experience that dont have effects on sunifiram with so high dose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was about 10 mg that led to the brain damage. Whether it&#39;s 5 or 10 or 20 doesn&#39;t matter as much as the extremely serious interactions. It was safe when used in total isolation. It can however interact with a number of other common stimulants to cause irreversible damage. If you had any sense of the hell that I experienced, you would then understand. I had to reluctantly use multiple multi-month-long courses of a benzo + valproate + memantine + telmisartan to get better. I struggled with continuous pressure headaches for years.</p>

<p>The set of stimulants that it interacts with are not well defined. I can tell you the names that applied to me, but it would be an incomplete list, and I don&#39;t want it to mislead any reader.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for responding. I hope my theory is on the right track.</p>

<p>I just started aripiprazole 2.5mg daily since yesterday. Should I taper it to 1mg? I am planning to do it anyways in 4 days once the dose reaches its half life. </p>

<p>Quick [google search](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24256194/</a>) shows Pregneleone enhances NMDA activation but in cerebellum region. Will this be a part of mesocortial pathway? What dose are you talking here?  I have 50mg pills from life extension with me.</p>

<p>Piracetam increases receptor density which absolutely makes sense to try. What doses do you have in mind?</p>

<p>Dont want to try memantine as the purpose is to enhance nmdar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a just question. As for sunifiram I tested 10-20mg. I find that in case of glutaminergics higher dose is not necessarily better. On the contrary.</p>
