        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys. Seeking a genuine suggestion for an effective Nootropic supplement with almost nil side effects and safe for long term usage. Basically I have a very sensitive and overtly active Sympathetic nervous system. Which means my heart rate and blood pressure shoots up even in mild altercations, normal provocative debate or even when getting Blood Pressure taken for medical checkup. Which otherwise is perfectly fine, that heart rate goes berserk even though I&#39;m not feeling much anxious and relatively calm. Docs scold me for being a kid and afraid of simple blood pressure. But only I know what I go through. It&#39;s like a switch turned on automatically as soon as I enter the clinic or if having an argument with someone. So please tell what are the most effective and safe Noots for calming SNS, adapting to stress and staying calm in these situations. </p>

<p>TLDR -; 22 Y/O guy. Anxiety and over sensitive sympathetic nervous system. Even with minimal anxiety heart rate shoots up along with B.P. in even mild altercations or while in doctors office. Please suggest some nootropics that are most effective and safe for incorporating in long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Xiao Yao Wan, or Free and Easy Wanderer, a Chinese herb mixture for stress and anxiety. It is the most prescribed TCM mixture in the West - because we are all stressed and anxious. </p>

<p>Planetary Herbals produced a great and effective one, but I think it was discontinued. I love it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, ashwagandha modulates GABA and high dose magnesium can help with sensitive nerves (probably only if you are deficient).</p>

<p>Outside of substances, you might have some issues with being criticized or with conflict. A hyperactive sympathetic nervous system can be indicative of trauma, always being on the alert. Deep psychological release has replaced many a need for substances for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started 3 years back when I went into ER for palpitations (GERD related) and my blood pressure was all over the roof due to panic. Since then I think my mindset has become like doctor or hospital is synonymous to panic and fear. I think this may be the hidden cause. </p>

<p>Anyways I had tried Ashwagandha but it messed with my Thyroid levels so had to drop.</p>

<p>What is your suggestion on L Theanine? I heard it is also an anxiolyte.</p>
