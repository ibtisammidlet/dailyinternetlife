        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i really love all of the products i’ve tried on bromantane.co, and i like how they’ve kind of filled the void that science.bio left behind after shutting down in terms of obscure/novel noots that actually have a lot of promise and efficacy that things every other nootropic supplier company can’t fulfill. that being said, i have a couple suggestions/requests for potential future products that i’d love to see bromantane.co eventually list, and i encourage everyone else to use this thread as a place to put your own suggestions!!</p>

<p>personally i’d really love to see:</p>

<p>dihexa - cycled this a few times with the dsmo solution science.bio had, and it helped immensely with depression and verbal fluency, even moreso than NSI-189!! and the two combined together is probably the best antidepressant i’ve ever taken in my life!!</p>

<p>cerebrolysin - never tried this one, but really want to. have heard incredible things about it, with some ppl even saying it’s the “master nootropic” of sorts just due to its wide array of abilities in relation to cognitive performance and other cognitive-related issues</p>

<p>memantine - i also tried this one from science.bio when it was still around, and again it was amazing for depression/anxiety/addictive behavior once a tolerance to the anticholinergic effects were built. also stacked pretty greatly with bromantane</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have put serious consideration into carrying cerebrolysin and one primitive idea is perhaps a cortexin nasal spray, since I know that is a powder and I won&#39;t have to worry about it degrading. The fragility of the substance is really what&#39;s holding that back but maybe it will be easier with cortexin. I think someone said it&#39;s abrasive, so it might be a no on that. And btw the prions stuff and the scary stories about cerebrolysin nasal spray seem bogus, a lot of people I know are using cerebrolysin nasal spray and love it. Plus it just makes sense.</p>

<p>For verbal fluency Piracetam and NSI-189 (as you mentioned) seem to check out. Definitely noticed that with NSI-189, so it&#39;s interesting you did as well. Dihexa though is definitely a lower priority though I&#39;ll bump it up since many people here seem to like it. Am not really sold on the concept of nonselective neurotrophic factor mimetics.</p>

<p>Memantine I probably won&#39;t carry, for a variety of reasons. But an experimental idea is gold nanostructured memantine which is selective to extrasynaptic NMDA. Just wish it had at least 3 studies, lol. But the concept is cool. Would be interesting if there were other extrasynaptic selective NMDA antagonists out there. But it seems unlikely.</p>

<p>cerebrolysin nasal spray</p>

<p>Could you elaborate on how this works? Is it just putting a standard 5ml dose into a spray bottle and using it throughout the day? Would it suffer from significant degradation due to exposure to air?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it can&#39;t be stored or shipped as a nasal spray due to degradation. Needs to be stored carefully and in cold temp, but if the user is the one to assemble it, it can be used successfully. The vendor cannot, however.</p>
