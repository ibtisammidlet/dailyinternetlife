        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anybody have any clue about bromantanes exact MOA? Talking about receptor sites and it&#39;s respective binding affinities at those receptor sites. I know it &quot;elevates dopamine&quot; and serotonin, and that it&#39;s purportedly a DRI and an SRI and that it elevates gaba via enzymatic breakdown inhibition and that it elevates tyrosine hydroxylase, etc yada yada yada ... So not talking about all this internet bro lore, but I am interested in numbers, percentages and especially in what brain areas it effects what and how much.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very powerful &quot;nootropic&quot; but it seems like everybody is taking it on faith alone, not knowing what exactly it&#39;s doing, which seem kinda moronic tbh.</p>

<p>I tried it a couple of times and it was very powerful, was never able to sleep without sleep aids and even then it was shitty sleep. Two days ago I tried it again, took 100mg intranasal (to big of a dose for sure). Libido went through the roof as did mood, motor movement patterns, etc. But the next day it started to turn into agitation, it felt a lot more noradrenergic then it did on the first day (but still very dopaminergic), again had to take sleep aids. 3rd day from taking it I still feel it, but it&#39;s lessened a lot but hard to gauge bc of all the gabaergic aids for sleep last day. So now I&#39;m thinking maybe 10 - 20mg&#39;s intranasal every day? But still, would really appreciate knowing more about it, especially it&#39;s action on the serotonin system.</p>

<p>Anyway, kindly appreciate any info you can muster! tnx</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, respectfully, if I&#39;m not missing some special synergistic potential, these 3 things wouldn&#39;t make a dent. Just for example, yesterday I had to take:, 150mg pregabalin, 300mg gabapentin and 0.25mg clonazepam, 12.5mg quetiapine and 300mg melatonin in order to get to sleep (probably could have done without clonazepam). And you&#39;re talking about apigenin and antioxidants. Again, no pun intended, you just didn&#39;t understand how activating bromantane was for me.</p>

<p>Any real suggestions maybe? With an NRI or a DRI, I would take, for instance, an a2a adrenergic agonist, but I&#39;m not so sure how effective it would be with bromantane. I don&#39;t know, if all the extra dopamine creation leads to dopamine being released via normal pathways  and can that be stoped via it&#39;s autoreceptors ...? And where is all the dopamine being created? Is it intracellular? And where? In the VTA?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How it could interact with IDRA-21? Since IDRA-21 belongs to the benzothiazide class of drugs, and since it has a very similar structure with diazoxin, another thiazide class drug, that is a potent opener of the ATP Potassium channels, it tend to think an interaction could be happening here between IDRA-21 and Bromantane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After some trials I can feel that IDRA-21 lowers my  blood pressure. I tend to think it shares some mechanism with diazoxide. It also interacts with my glucose apparently. Will do some blood tests.<br/>
Also IDRA-21 produces some tolerance that can be mitigated by BDNF inducers like Noopept and Polygala, also with keto diets and fasting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the big question. However IDRA-21 according to studies requires much lower concentrations compared to cyclothiazide to inhibit AMPA receptor desensitization. However, it has been very difficult for me to find studies that show what is the specific mechanism by which IDRA-21 produces its effects. That said, according to my subjective experience and some measurements, such as blood pressure before and after, I believe that IDRA-21 shares some mechanisms with Diazoxide, for example the opening of potassium channels, IDRA-21 produces a vasodilatory effect, and reduces blood pressure when I am taking methylphenidate (For ADHD prescribed), is feels like it relaxes muscles. In general Diazoxide is not seen as a very risky drug, from what I was reading potassium channel openers can help prevent heart disease. It is a very interesting topic. As a suggestion, I think that a dose of 15mg+ of IDRA-21 daily can be very high, without something like memantine daily doses of 30 mg could lead to excitoxicity, white matter damage.<br/>
Another problem with IDRA-21 is that tolerance or habituation develops to its effects. I have not felt this tolerance in the following situations:<br/>
1) When consuming Polygala habitually (BDNF inducer, NMDA Antagonist).<br/>
2) During fasts, when my body is entering or has already entered Ketosis.<br/>
That makes me hypothesize that tolerance to IDRA-21 has to do with BDNF neurotrophins and TrkB receptors. That is a problem with IDRA-21 compared to other ampakines, which does not induce an increase in BDNF as a downstream effect of AMPA activation (there are two class of ampakines, those that induce bdnf and those that do not, but I don&#39;t remember right now the exact class name). In fact, if you search for cyclothiazide and BDNF you will come across studies showing a decrease in BDNF after the use of Cyclothiazide. It is unknown if IDRA-21 interacts with BDNF in any way, there are no studies on it.<br/>
I am currently experimenting with Noopept and IDRA-21, I dare to say that noopept (oral administration, sublingual does not produce the same levels of cycloprolylglycine) maintains the effects of IDRA-21 longer, although not with the same effect as the first dose. Well, there are many doubts about IDRA-21, some studies hypothesize that it is better to use it in discontinuous doses, one day on, one day off, one day one. I can share some of those studies, I have the PDFs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even without knowing the full MOA, the known upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopaminergic activity in general in thalamic and limbic regions can viably cause insomnia alone. Bromantaneâ€™s effects last a long time and it was originally formulated to be taken orally, which of course has a much lower bioavailability than the intranasal route, in doses no higher than 100mg. Iâ€™ve experienced insomnia from bromantane when only taken orally for longer periods. All I can recommend is to stop taking bromantane for at least a week until your sleep normalizes and then reintroduce it at a much lower intranasal dose (say, no higher than 25mg) and reevaluate how youâ€™re doing from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/flammablelemon You think dopamine upregulation is global? And do you think it&#39;s regulated via dopamine&#39;s autoreceptors? I mean, the dopamine is not created extracellular, right? So it still needs to get released? But seeing how profoundly strong it is in increasing dopamine effects, I wonder, is the dopamine actually created extracellular and is thus the brain just flooded with dopamine independently of it&#39;s releasing mechanisms in to the synaptic cleft ... Otherwise bromantane would need to be a really strong DRI ...</p>
