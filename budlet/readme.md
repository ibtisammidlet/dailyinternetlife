##phelsofy:  
-buy cheap stuff first  
-use all income, don't keep any savings  
-There are four types of consumer behavior: habitual buying behavior, variety-seeking behavior, dissonance-reducing buying behavior, complex buying behavior, this phelsofy is habitual buying  combined with variety-seeking behavior (in term of multiple type of products not exctly brends)
